Cetshwayo kaMpande (/kɛtʃˈwaɪ.oʊ/; Zulu pronunciation: [kǀétʃwajo kámpande]; c. 
1826 – 8 February 1884) was the King of the Zulu Kingdom from 1872 to 1879 and its leader during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. 
His name has been transliterated as Cetawayo, Cetewayo, Cetywajo and Ketchwayo. 
He famously led the Zulu nation to victory against the British in the Battle of Isandlwana. 
Early life 
Cetshwayo was a son of Zulu king Mpande[1] and Queen Ngqumbazi, half-nephew of Zulu king Shaka and grandson of Senzangakhona kaJama.

Adult education is a practice in which adults engage in systematic and sustained self–educating activities in order to gain new forms of knowledge, skills, attitudes, or values.[1] It can mean any form of learning adults engage in beyond traditional schooling, encompassing basic literacy to personal fulfillment as a lifelong learner.[2] In particular, adult education reflects a specific philosophy about learning and teaching based on the assumption that adults can and want to learn, that they are able and willing to take responsibility for that learning, and that the learning itself should respond to their needs.[3] Driven by what one needs or wants to learn, the available opportunities, and the manner in which one learns, adult learning is affected by demographics, globalization and technology.[4] The learning happens in many ways and in many contexts just as all adults' lives differ.[5] Adult learning can be in any of the three contexts, i.e. 
Formal – Structured learning that typically takes place in an education or training institution, usually with a set curriculum and carries credentials; Non-formal – Learning that is organized by educational institutions but non credential. 
Non-formal learning opportunities may be provided in the workplace and through the activities of civil society organizations and groups; Informal education – Learning that goes on all the time, resulting from daily life activities related to work, family, community or leisure (e.g. community baking class).[6][7] 
Characteristics 
Defined as the science and art of helping adults learn,[8][9] the practice of adult education is referred to as andragogy, to distinguish it from the traditional school-based education for children pedagogy. 
Unlike children, adults are seen as: 
More self-directed, rather than relying on others for help Mature and therefore experienced with the experience providing a rich source for learning An Adult's readiness to learn is linked to what one needs to know Adult orientation to learn is problem centred rather than subject centered Adult motivation to learn is internal.[9] 
Educating adults differs from educating children in several ways given that adults have accumulated knowledge and work experience which can add to the learning experience.[10] Another difference is that most adult education is voluntary, therefore, the participants are generally self-motivated, unless required to participate, by an employer, for example. 
Adults frequently apply their knowledge in a practical fashion to learn effectively. 
They must have a reasonable expectation that the knowledge they gain will help them further their goals. 
For example, during the 1990s, many adults, including mostly office workers, enrolled in computer training courses. 
These courses would teach basic use of the operating system or specific application software. 
Because the abstractions governing the user's interactions with a PC were so new, many people who had been working white-collar jobs for ten years or more eventually took such training courses, either at their own whim (to gain computer skills and thus earn higher pay) or at the behest of their managers. 
In the United States and many areas in Canada, a more general example is when adults who dropped out of high school return to school to complete general education requirements. 
Most upwardly mobile positions require at the very least a high school diploma or equivalent. 
A working adult is unlikely to have the freedom to simply quit his or her job and go "back to school" full-time. Public school systems and community colleges usually offer evening or weekend classes for this reason. 
In Europe this is often referred to as "second-chance", and many schools offer tailor-made courses and learning programs for these returning learners. 
Furthermore, adults with poor reading skills can obtain help from volunteer literacy programs. 
These national organizations provide training, tutor certification, and accreditation for local volunteer programs. 
States often have organizations which provide field services for volunteer literacy programs. 
Purposes of adult education may vary, the general purposes of which are summarized as: 
Vocational Social Recreational Self-development[11] 
One of its goals may be to help adult learners satisfy their personal needs and achieve their professional goals.[12] Therefore, its ultimate goal might be to achieve human fulfillment. 
The goal might also be to achieve an institution's needs. 
For example, this might include improving its operational effectiveness and productivity. 
A larger scale goal of adult education may be the growth of society by enabling its citizens to keep up with societal change and maintain good social order.[1] 
The purpose of adult education in the form of college or university is distinct. 
In these institutions, the aim is typically related to personal growth and development as well as occupation and career preparedness. 
Another goal might be to not only sustain the democratic society, but to even challenge and improve its social structure.[1] 
Another fast-growing sector of adult education is English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), also referred to as English as a Second Language (ESL) or English Language Learners (ELL).[13] These courses are key in assisting immigrants with not only the acquisition of the English language, but the acclimation process to the culture of the United States as well as other English speaking countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.[14] 
A common problem in adult education in the US is the lack of professional development opportunities for adult educators. 
Most adult educators come from other professions and are not well trained to deal with adult learning issues. 
Most of the positions available in this field are only part-time without any benefits or stability since they are usually funded by government grants that might last for only a couple of years. However, in Canada, professional development is available in all provinces and territories through postsecondary institutions and most Provinces also provide professional development through their ministry of education or school boards and through nongovernmental organizations.[15] In addition, there are programs about adult education for existing and aspiring practitioners offered, at various academic levels, by universities, colleges, and professional organizations.[16] 
Principles 
The principles of andragogy flow directly from an understanding of the characteristics of adults as learners and can be recognized when we understand the characteristics of adults, and see the way those characteristics influence how adults learn best.[17] Teachers who follow the principles of andragogy when choosing materials for training and when designing program delivery, find that their learners progress more quickly, and are more successful in reaching their goals.[17] The Canadian Literacy and Learning Network outlines the 7 key principles of adult learning. 
In other words, these 7 principles distinguish adult learners from children and youth. 
Adults cannot be made to learn. 
They will only learn when they are internally motivated to do so. 
Adults will only learn what they feel they need to learn. In other words, they are practical. 
Adults learn by doing. 
Active participation is especially important to adult learners in comparison to children. 
Adult learning is problem-based and these problems must be realistic. 
Adult learners like finding solutions to problems. 
Adult learning is affected by the experience each adult brings. Adults learn best informally. 
Adults learn what they feel they need to know whereas children learn from a curriculum. 
Children want guidance. 
Adults want information that will help them improve their situation or that of their children.[18] 
Challenges and motivating factors 
Adults have many responsibilities that they must balance against the demands of learning. 
Because of these responsibilities, adults have barriers and challenges against participating in learning and continuing their education. 
The barriers can be classified into three groups: 
Institutional Situational Dispositional[19] 
Some of these barriers include the lack of time balancing career and family demands, finances, transportation. confidence, or interest, lack of information about opportunities to learn, scheduling problems, entrance requirements and problems with child care.[20] Other obstacles that prevent adults from pursuing further education are fear, shyness, ego, and stigma. 
Daily wagers are reluctant to join schools as by joining these schools they lose their only source of income. 
Distance learning can address some of the institutional barriers such as class scheduling and entrance requirements.[21] Fear, shyness, ego, or stigma can also prevent adults from pursuing further education. 
Keeping adults motivated, instilling in them confidence, reinforcing positive self-esteem allows for them to develop into lifelong learners.[22] Typical motivations include a requirement for competence or licensing, an expected (or realized) promotion, job enrichment, a need to maintain old skills or learn new ones, a need to adapt to job changes, or the need to learn in order to comply with company directives. 
The best way to motivate adult learners is simply to enhance their reasons for enrolling and decrease the barriers. 
Instructors must learn why their students are enrolled (the motivators); they have to discover what is keeping them from learning. 
Then the instructors must plan their motivating strategies. 
A successful strategy includes showing adult learners the relationship between training and an expected promotion, they can be shown that the course benefits them pragmatically, they will perform better, and the benefits will be longer lasting.[23] It is crucial for teachers to be aware of the characteristics of their learners and that they develop lessons that address both the strengths and the needs of their individual students.[24]

In 1952, the ANC began preparation for a joint Defiance Campaign against apartheid with Indian and communist groups, founding a National Voluntary Board to recruit volunteers. 
The campaign was designed to follow the path of nonviolent resistance influenced by Mahatma Gandhi; some supported this for ethical reasons, but Mandela instead considered it pragmatic.[79] At a Durban rally on 22 June, Mandela addressed an assembled crowd of 10,000, initiating the campaign protests, for which he was arrested and briefly interned in Marshall Square prison.[80] With further protests, the ANC's membership grew from 20,000 to 100,000; the government responded with mass arrests and introduced the Public Safety Act, 1953 to permit martial law.[81] In May, authorities banned Transvaal ANC President J. B. Marks from making public appearances; unable to maintain his position, he recommended Mandela as his successor. 
Although Africanists opposed his candidacy, Mandela was elected regional president in October.[82] 
Mandela's former home in the Johannesburg township of Soweto 
In July 1952, Mandela was arrested under the Suppression of Communism Act and stood trial as a part of the 21 accused – among them Moroka, Sisulu, and Yusuf Dadoo – in Johannesburg. 
Found guilty of "statutory communism", a term that the government used to describe most opposition to apartheid, their sentence of nine months' hard labour was suspended for two years.[83] In December, Mandela was given a six-month ban from attending meetings or talking to more than one individual at a time, making his Transvaal ANC presidency impractical, and during this period the Defiance Campaign petered out.[84] In September 1953, Andrew Kunene read out Mandela's "No Easy Walk to Freedom" speech at a Transvaal ANC meeting; the title was taken from a quote by Indian independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru, a seminal influence on Mandela's thought. 
The speech laid out a contingency plan for a scenario in which the ANC was banned. 
This Mandela Plan, or M-Plan, involved dividing the organisation into a cell structure with a more centralised leadership.[85] 
Mandela obtained work as an attorney for the firm Terblanche and Briggish, before moving to the liberal-run Helman and Michel, passing qualification exams to become a full-fledged attorney.[86] In August 1953, Mandela and Tambo opened their own law firm, Mandela and Tambo, operating in downtown Johannesburg. 
The only African-run law firm in the country, it was popular with aggrieved blacks, often dealing with cases of police brutality. 
Disliked by the authorities, the firm was forced to relocate to a remote location after their office permit was removed under the Group Areas Act; as a result, their custom dwindled.[87] Though a second daughter, Makaziwe Phumia, was born in May 1954, Mandela's relationship with Evelyn became strained, and she accused him of adultery. 
Claims have emerged that he was having affairs with ANC member Lillian Ngoyi and secretary Ruth Mompati; various individuals close to Mandela in this period have stated that the latter bore him a child.[88] Disgusted by her son's behaviour, Nosekeni returned to Transkei, while Evelyn embraced the Jehovah's Witnesses and rejected Mandela's preoccupation with politics.[89] 
Congress of the People and the Treason Trial: 1955–61 
After taking part in the unsuccessful protest to prevent the forced relocation of all black people from the Sophiatown suburb of Johannesburg in February 1955, Mandela concluded that violent action would prove necessary to end apartheid and white minority rule.[91] He advised Sisulu to request weaponry from the People's Republic of China, but though the Chinese government supported the anti-apartheid struggle, they believed the movement insufficiently prepared for guerilla warfare.[92] With the involvement of the South African Indian Congress, the Coloured People's Congress, the South African Congress of Trade Unions and the Congress of Democrats, the ANC planned a Congress of the People, calling on all South Africans to send in proposals for a post-apartheid era. Based on the responses, a Freedom Charter was drafted by Rusty Bernstein, calling for the creation of a democratic, non-racialist state with the nationalisation of major industry. 
When the charter was adopted at a June 1955 conference in Kliptown attended by 3000 delegates, police cracked down on the event, but it remained a key part of Mandela's ideology.[93] 
Following the end of a second ban in September 1955, Mandela went on a working holiday to Transkei to discuss the implications of the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951 with local tribal leaders, also visiting his mother and Noengland before proceeding to Cape Town.[94] In March 1956 he received his third ban on public appearances, restricting him to Johannesburg for five years, but he often defied it.[95] His marriage broke down as Evelyn left Mandela, taking their children to live with her brother. 
Initiating divorce proceedings in May 1956, she claimed that Mandela had physically abused her; he denied the allegations, and fought for custody of their children.[96] She withdrew her petition of separation in November, but Mandela filed for divorce in January 1958; the divorce was finalised in March, with the children placed in Evelyn's care.[97] During the divorce proceedings, he began courting and politicising a social worker, Winnie Madikizela, whom he married in Bizana in June 1958. 
She later became involved in ANC activities, spending several weeks in prison.[98] Together they had two children; Zenani was born in February 1959 and Zindziswa in December 1960.[99] 
Mandela has been depicted in cinema and television on multiple occasions. He was portrayed by Danny Glover in the 1987 HBO telefilm Mandela.[474] The 1997 film Mandela and de Klerk starred Sidney Poitier as Mandela,[475] and Dennis Haysbert played him in Goodbye Bafana (2007).[476] In the 2009 BBC telefilm Mrs Mandela, Mandela was portrayed by David Harewood,[477] and Morgan Freeman portrayed him in Invictus (2009).[478] Terrence Howard portrayed him in the 2011 film Winnie Mandela.[479] He was portrayed by Idris Elba in the 2013 film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.[480]

MK, the SACP, and African tour: 1961–62 
In December 1956, Mandela was arrested alongside most of the ANC national executive, accused of "high treason" against the state. 
Held in Johannesburg Prison amid mass protests, they underwent a preparatory examination before being granted bail.[101] The defence's refutation began in January 1957, overseen by defence lawyer Vernon Berrangé, and continued until adjourning in September. 
In January 1958, Oswald Pirow was appointed to prosecute the case, and in February the judge ruled that there was "sufficient reason" for the defendants to go on trial in the Transvaal Supreme Court.[102] The formal Treason Trial began in Pretoria in August 1958, with the defendants successfully applying to have the three judges – all linked to the governing National Party – replaced. 
In August, one charge was dropped, and in October the prosecution withdrew its indictment, submitting a reformulated version in November which argued that the ANC leadership committed high treason by advocating violent revolution, a charge the defendants denied.[103] 
In April 1959, Africanists dissatisfied with the ANC's united front approach founded the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC); Mandela's friend Robert Sobukwe was elected president, although Mandela disagreed with the group's racially exclusionary views, describing them as "immature" and "naïve".[104] Both parties campaigned for an anti-pass campaign in early 1960, in which Africans burned the passes that they were legally obliged to carry. 
One of the PAC-organised demonstrations was fired upon by police, resulting in the deaths of 69 protesters in the Sharpeville massacre. 
The incident brought international condemnation of the government and resulted in rioting throughout South Africa, with Mandela publicly burning his pass in solidarity.[105] 
Responding to the unrest, the government implemented state of emergency measures, declaring martial law and banning the ANC and PAC, while in March they arrested Mandela and other activists, imprisoning them for five months without charge in the unsanitary conditions of the Pretoria Local prison.[106] Imprisonment caused problems for Mandela and his co-defendants in the Treason Trial; their lawyers could not reach them, and so it was decided that the lawyers would withdraw in protest until the accused were freed from prison when the state of emergency was lifted in late August 1960.[107] Over the following months, Mandela used his free time to organise an All-In African Conference near Pietermaritzburg, Natal, in March 1961, at which 1,400 anti-apartheid delegates met, agreeing on a stay-at-home strike to mark 31 May, the day South Africa became a republic.[108] On 29 March 1961, six years after the Treason Trial began, the judges produced a verdict of not guilty, claiming that there was insufficient evidence to convict the accused of "high treason" for they had not advocated either communism nor violent revolution; the outcome embarrassed the government.[109] 
Thatched room at Liliesleaf Farm, where Mandela hid 
Disguised as a chauffeur, Mandela travelled the country incognito, organising the ANC's new cell structure and the planned mass stay-at-home strike. 
Referred to as the "Black Pimpernel" in the press – a reference to Emma Orczy's 1905 novel The Scarlet Pimpernel – a warrant for his arrest was put out by the police.[110] Mandela held secret meetings with reporters, and after the government failed to prevent the strike, he warned them that many anti-apartheid activists would soon resort to violence through groups like the PAC's Poqo.[111] He believed that the ANC should form an armed group to channel some of this violence in a controlled direction, convincing both ANC leader Albert Luthuli – who was morally opposed to violence – and allied activist groups of its necessity.[112] 
Inspired by the actions of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement in the Cuban Revolution, in 1961 Mandela, Sisulu, and Slovo co-founded Umkhonto we Sizwe ("Spear of the Nation", abbreviated MK). 
Becoming chairman of the militant group, Mandela gained ideas from Marxist literature on guerilla warfare by Mao and Che Guevara as well as from the military theorist Carl von Clausewitz.[113] Although initially declared officially separate from the ANC so as not to taint the latter's reputation, it later became widely recognised that MK was the party's armed wing.[114] Most early MK members were white communists who were able to hide Mandela in their homes; after hiding in communist Wolfie Kodesh's flat in Berea, Mandela moved to the communist-owned Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia, there joined by Raymond Mhlaba, Slovo, and Bernstein, who put together the MK constitution.[115] Although in later life Mandela denied ever being a member of the Communist Party, historical research published in 2011 strongly suggested that he had joined in the late 1950s or early 1960s.[116] This was confirmed by both the SACP and the ANC after Mandela's death. 
According to the SACP, he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee, but later denied it for political reasons.[117] 
Operating through a cell structure, MK planned to carry out acts of sabotage that would exert maximum pressure on the government with minimum casualties; they sought to bomb military installations, power plants, telephone lines, and transport links at night, when civilians were not present. 
Mandela stated that they chose sabotage because it was the least harmful action, did not involve killing, and offered the best hope for racial reconciliation afterward; he nevertheless acknowledged that should this fail then guerrilla warfare might have been necessary.[119] Soon after ANC leader Luthuli was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, MK publicly announced its existence with 57 bombings on Dingane's Day (16 December) 1961, followed by further attacks on New Year's Eve.[120] 
The ANC decided to send Mandela as a delegate to the February 1962 Pan-African Freedom Movement for East, Central and Southern Africa (PAFMECSA) meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.[121] Leaving South Africa in secret via Bechuanaland, on the journey Mandela visited Tanganyika and met with its president, Julius Nyerere.[122] Arriving in Ethiopia, Mandela met with Emperor Haile Selassie I, and gave his speech after Selassie's at the conference.[123] After the symposium, he travelled to Cairo, Egypt, admiring the political reforms of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, and then went to Tunis, Tunisia, where President Habib Bourguiba gave him £5000 for weaponry. 
He proceeded to Morocco, Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Senegal, receiving funds from Liberian President William Tubman and Guinean President Ahmed Sékou Touré.[124] Leaving Africa for London, England, he met anti-apartheid activists, reporters, and prominent politicians.[125] Returning to Ethiopia, he began a six-month course in guerrilla warfare, but completed only two months before being recalled to South Africa.[126] 
Imprisonment 
Arrest and Rivonia trial: 1962–64 
On 5 August 1962, police captured Mandela along with fellow activist Cecil Williams near Howick.[127] Various rumours have circulated suggesting that the authorities were tipped off with regard to Mandela's whereabouts, although Mandela himself gave these little credence.[128] One idea was that his location had been revealed to South African police by the United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which feared that Mandela was a communist; this claim later received support from an ex-U.S. diplomat who claimed involvement in the operation.[129][130] Jailed in Johannesburg's Marshall Square prison, Mandela was charged with inciting workers' strikes and leaving the country without permission. 
Representing himself with Slovo as legal advisor, Mandela intended to use the trial to showcase "the ANC's moral opposition to racism" while supporters demonstrated outside the court.[131] Moved to Pretoria, where Winnie could visit him, in his cell he began correspondence studies for a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree from the University of London.[132] His hearing began in October, but he disrupted proceedings by wearing a traditional kaross, refusing to call any witnesses, and turning his plea of mitigation into a political speech. 
Found guilty, he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment; as he left the courtroom, supporters sang "Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika".[133] 
In July 1963, police raided Liliesleaf Farm, arresting those they found there and uncovering paperwork documenting MK's activities, some of which mentioned Mandela. 
The Rivonia Trial began at Pretoria Supreme Court in October, with Mandela and his comrades charged with four counts of sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government; their chief prosecutor was Percy Yutar.[136] Judge Quartus de Wet soon threw out the prosecution's case for insufficient evidence, but Yutar reformulated the charges, presenting his new case from December until February 1964, calling 173 witnesses and bringing thousands of documents and photographs to the trial.[137] 
Although four of the accused denied involvement with MK, Mandela and the five other accused admitted sabotage but denied that they had ever agreed to initiate guerrilla war against the government.[138] They used the trial to highlight their political cause; at the opening of the defence's proceedings, Mandela gave his three-hour "I Am Prepared to Die" speech. 
That speech – which was inspired by Castro's "History Will Absolve Me" – was widely reported in the press despite official censorship.[139] The trial gained international attention; there were global calls for the release of the accused from the United Nations and World Peace Council, while the University of London Union voted Mandela to its presidency.[140] On 12 June 1964, justice De Wet found Mandela and two of his co-accused guilty on all four charges; although the prosecution had called for the death sentence to be applied, the judge instead condemned them to life imprisonment.[141] 
Though attending Christian Sunday services, Mandela studied Islam.[150] He also studied Afrikaans, hoping to build a mutual respect with the warders and convert them to his cause.[151] Various official visitors met with Mandela; most significant was the liberal parliamentary representative Helen Suzman of the Progressive Party, who championed Mandela's cause outside prison.[152] In September 1970 he met British Labour Party MP Dennis Healey.[153] South African Minister of Justice Jimmy Kruger visited in December 1974, but he and Mandela did not get on.[154] His mother visited in 1968, dying shortly after, and his firstborn son Thembi died in a car accident the following year; Mandela was forbidden from attending either funeral.[155] His wife was rarely able to visit, being regularly imprisoned for political activity, and his daughters first visited in December 1975; Winnie got out of prison in 1977 but was forcibly settled in Brandfort, still unable to visit him.[156] 
Robben Island: 1964–82 
Mandela and his co-accused were transferred from Pretoria to the prison on Robben Island, remaining there for the next 18 years.[142] Isolated from non-political prisoners in Section B, Mandela was imprisoned in a damp concrete cell measuring 8 feet (2.4 m) by 7 feet (2.1 m), with a straw mat on which to sleep.[143] Verbally and physically harassed by several white prison wardens, the Rivonia Trial prisoners spent their days breaking rocks into gravel, until being reassigned in January 1965 to work in a lime quarry. 
Mandela was initially forbidden to wear sunglasses, and the glare from the lime permanently damaged his eyesight.[144] At night, he worked on his LLB degree, but newspapers were forbidden, and he was locked in solitary confinement on several occasions for possessing smuggled news clippings.[145] Initially classified as the lowest grade of prisoner, Class D, he was permitted one visit and one letter every six months, although all mail was heavily censored.[146] 
Lime quarry on Robben Island where Mandela and other prisoners were subjected to hard labour 
The political prisoners took part in work and hunger strikes – the latter considered largely ineffective by Mandela – to improve prison conditions, viewing this as a microcosm of the anti-apartheid struggle.[147] ANC prisoners elected him to their four-man "High Organ" along with Sisulu, Govan Mbeki, and Raymond Mhlaba, and he involved himself in a group representing all political prisoners on the island, Ulundi, through which he forged links with PAC and Yu Chi Chan Club members.[148] Initiating the "University of Robben Island", whereby prisoners lectured on their own areas of expertise, he debated socio-political topics with his comrades.[149] 
By the late 1960s, Mandela's fame had been eclipsed by Steve Biko and the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM). 
Seeing the ANC as ineffectual, the BCM called for militant action, but following the Soweto uprising of 1976, many BCM activists were imprisoned on Robben Island.[166] Mandela tried to build a relationship with these young radicals, although he was critical of their racialism and contempt for white anti-apartheid activists.[167] Renewed international interest in his plight came in July 1978, when he celebrated his 60th birthday.[168] He was awarded an honorary doctorate in Lesotho, the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding in India in 1979, and the Freedom of the City of Glasgow, Scotland in 1981.[169] In March 1980 the slogan "Free Mandela!" was developed by journalist Percy Qoboza, sparking an international campaign that led the UN Security Council to call for his release.[170] Despite increasing foreign pressure, the government refused, relying on powerful foreign Cold War allies in US President Ronald Reagan and UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher; both considered Mandela's ANC a terrorist organisation sympathetic to communism and supported its suppression.[171] 
From 1967, prison conditions improved; black prisoners were given trousers rather than shorts, games were permitted, and the standard of their food was raised.[157] In 1969, an escape plan for Mandela was developed by Gordon Bruce, but it was abandoned after being infiltrated by an agent of the South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS), who hoped to see Mandela shot during the escape.[158] In 1970, Commander Piet Badenhorst became commanding officer. 
Mandela, seeing an increase in the physical and mental abuse of prisoners, complained to visiting judges, who had Badenhorst reassigned.[159] He was replaced by Commander Willie Willemse, who developed a co-operative relationship with Mandela and was keen to improve prison standards.[160] 
By 1975, Mandela had become a Class A prisoner,[162] allowing greater numbers of visits and letters; he corresponded with anti-apartheid activists like Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Desmond Tutu.[163] That year, he began his autobiography, which was smuggled to London, but remained unpublished at the time; prison authorities discovered several pages, and his study privileges were stopped for four years.[164] Instead he devoted his spare time to gardening and reading until he resumed his LLB degree studies in 1980.[165] 
Pollsmoor Prison: 1982–88 
In April 1982 Mandela was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada and Raymond Mhlaba; they believed that they were being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists.[172] Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than at Robben Island, although Mandela missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island.[173] Getting on well with Pollsmoor's commanding officer, Brigadier Munro, Mandela was permitted to create a roof garden,[174] also reading voraciously and corresponding widely, now permitted 52 letters a year.[175] He was appointed patron of the multi-racial United Democratic Front (UDF), founded to combat reforms implemented by South African President P. W. Botha. 
Botha's National Party government had permitted Coloured and Indian citizens to vote for their own parliaments which had control over education, health, and housing, but black Africans were excluded from the system; like Mandela, the UDF saw this as an attempt to divide the anti-apartheid movement on racial lines.[176] 
Bust of Mandela erected on London's South Bank by the Greater London Council administration of Ken Livingstone in 1985 
Violence across the country escalated, with many fearing civil war. 
Under pressure from an international lobby, multinational banks stopped investing in South Africa, resulting in economic stagnation. 
Numerous banks and Thatcher asked Botha to release Mandela – then at the height of his international fame – to defuse the volatile situation.[177] Although considering Mandela a dangerous "arch-Marxist",[178] in February 1985 Botha offered him a release from prison on condition that he "unconditionally rejected violence as a political weapon". 
Mandela spurned the offer, releasing a statement through his daughter Zindzi stating "What freedom am I being offered while the organisation of the people [ANC] remains banned? 
A prisoner cannot enter into contracts."[179][180] 
In 1985 Mandela underwent surgery on an enlarged prostate gland, before being given new solitary quarters on the ground floor.[181] He was met by "seven eminent persons", an international delegation sent to negotiate a settlement, but Botha's government refused to co-operate, in June calling a state of emergency and initiating a police crackdown on unrest. 
The anti-apartheid resistance fought back, with the ANC committing 231 attacks in 1986 and 235 in 1987. 
The violence escalated as the government used the army and police to combat the resistance, and provided covert support for vigilante groups and for the Zulu nationalist movement Inkatha, which was involved in an increasingly violent struggle with the ANC.[182] Mandela requested talks with Botha but was denied, instead secretly meeting with Minister of Justice Kobie Coetsee in 1987, having a further 11 meetings over 3 years. 
Coetsee organised negotiations between Mandela and a team of four government figures starting in May 1988; the team agreed to the release of political prisoners and the legalisation of the ANC on the condition that they permanently renounce violence, break links with the Communist Party and not insist on majority rule. 
Mandela rejected these conditions, insisting that the ANC would only end the armed struggle when the government renounced violence.[183] 
Recovering from tuberculosis exacerbated by the dank conditions in his cell,[187] in December 1988 Mandela was moved to Victor Verster Prison near Paarl. 
Here, he was housed in the relative comfort of a warder's house with a personal cook, using the time to complete his LLB degree.[188] There he was permitted many visitors and organised secret communications with exiled ANC leader Oliver Tambo.[189][190] In 1989, Botha suffered a stroke, retaining the state presidency but stepping down as leader of the National Party, to be replaced by F. W. de Klerk.[191] In a surprise move, Botha invited Mandela to a meeting over tea in July 1989, an invitation Mandela considered genial.[192] Botha was replaced as state president by de Klerk six weeks later; the new president believed that apartheid was unsustainable and released a number of ANC prisoners.[193] Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, de Klerk called his cabinet together to debate legalising the ANC and freeing Mandela. 
Although some were deeply opposed to his plans, de Klerk met with Mandela in December to discuss the situation, a meeting both men considered friendly, before legalising all formerly banned political parties in February 1990 and announcing Mandela's unconditional release.[194][195] Shortly thereafter, for the first time in 20 years, photographs of Mandela were allowed to be published in South Africa.[196] 
Mandela's 70th birthday in July 1988 attracted international attention, notably with a tribute concert at London's Wembley Stadium that was televised and watched by an estimated 200 million viewers.[184][185] Although presented globally as a heroic figure, he faced personal problems when ANC leaders informed him that Winnie had set herself up as head of a criminal gang, the "Mandela United Football Club", who had been responsible for torturing and killing opponents – including children – in Soweto. 
Though some encouraged him to divorce her, he decided to remain loyal until she was found guilty by trial.[186] 
Victor Verster Prison and release: 1988–90 
"Nelson Mandela – Freedom fighter in South Africa" as stated in Russian by this 1988 Soviet commemorative stamp dating from the Gorbachev era 
Mandela proceeded on an African tour, meeting supporters and politicians in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Libya and Algeria, continuing to Sweden where he was reunited with Tambo, and then London, where he appeared at the Nelson Mandela: An International Tribute for a Free South Africa concert in Wembley Stadium.[202] Encouraging foreign countries to support sanctions against the apartheid government, in France he was welcomed by President François Mitterrand, in Vatican City by Pope John Paul II, and in the United Kingdom he met Thatcher. 
In the United States, he met President George H.W. Bush, addressed both Houses of Congress and visited eight cities, being particularly popular among the African-American community.[203] In Cuba he met President Fidel Castro, whom he had long admired, with the two becoming friends.[204] He met President R. Venkataraman in India, President Suharto in Indonesia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in Malaysia, Prime Minister Bob Hawke in Australia, and visited Japan; he did not visit the Soviet Union, a longtime ANC supporter.[205] 
Leaving Victor Verster Prison on 11 February, Mandela held Winnie's hand in front of amassed crowds and press; the event was broadcast live across the world.[197][198] Driven to Cape Town's City Hall through crowds, he gave a speech declaring his commitment to peace and reconciliation with the white minority, but made it clear that the ANC's armed struggle was not over, and would continue as "a purely defensive action against the violence of apartheid." 
He expressed hope that the government would agree to negotiations, so that "there may no longer be the need for the armed struggle", and insisted that his main focus was to bring peace to the black majority and give them the right to vote in national and local elections.[199][200] Staying at the home of Desmond Tutu, in the following days Mandela met with friends, activists, and press, giving a speech to an estimated 100,000 people at Johannesburg's Soccer City.[201] 
End of apartheid 
Early negotiations: 1990–91 
Luthuli House in Johannesburg, which became the ANC headquarters in 1991 
In May 1990, Mandela led a multiracial ANC delegation into preliminary negotiations with a government delegation of 11 Afrikaner men. 
Mandela impressed them with his discussions of Afrikaner history, and the negotiations led to the Groot Schuur Minute, in which the government lifted the state of emergency. 
In August Mandela – recognising the ANC's severe military disadvantage – offered a ceasefire, the Pretoria Minute, for which he was widely criticised by MK activists.[206] He spent much time trying to unify and build the ANC, appearing at a Johannesburg conference in December attended by 1600 delegates, many of whom found him more moderate than expected.[207] At the ANC's July 1991 national conference in Durban, Mandela admitted the party's faults and announced his aim to build a "strong and well-oiled task force" for securing majority rule. 
At the conference, he was elected ANC President, replacing the ailing Tambo, and a 50-strong multiracial, mixed gendered national executive was elected.[208] 
Mandela was given an office in the newly purchased ANC headquarters at Shell House, central Johannesburg, and moved with Winnie to her large Soweto home.[209] Their marriage was increasingly strained as he learned of her affair with Dali Mpofu, but he supported her during her trial for kidnapping and assault. He gained funding for her defence from the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa and from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, but in June 1991 she was found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison, reduced to two on appeal. 
On 13 April 1992, Mandela publicly announced his separation from Winnie. The ANC forced her to step down from the national executive for misappropriating ANC funds; Mandela moved into the mostly white Johannesburg suburb of Houghton.[210] Mandela's prospects for a peaceful transition were further damaged by the increase in "black-on-black" violence, particularly between ANC and Inkatha supporters in KwaZulu-Natal, in which thousands died. 
Mandela met with Inkatha leader Buthelezi, but the ANC prevented further negotiations on the issue. 
Mandela argued that there was a "third force" within the state intelligence services fuelling the "slaughter of the people" and openly blamed de Klerk – whom he increasingly distrusted – for the Sebokeng massacre.[211] In September 1991 a national peace conference was held in Johannesburg in which Mandela, Buthelezi and de Klerk signed a peace accord, though the violence continued.[212] 
De Klerk and Mandela shake hands at the World Economic Forum, 1992 
CODESA talks: 1991–92 
The Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) began in December 1991 at the Johannesburg World Trade Center, attended by 228 delegates from 19 political parties. 
Although Cyril Ramaphosa led the ANC's delegation, Mandela remained a key figure, and after de Klerk used the closing speech to condemn the ANC's violence, he took to the stage to denounce de Klerk as "head of an illegitimate, discredited minority regime". 
Dominated by the National Party and ANC, little negotiation was achieved.[213] CODESA 2 was held in May 1992, in which de Klerk insisted that post-apartheid South Africa must use a federal system with a rotating presidency to ensure the protection of ethnic minorities; Mandela opposed this, demanding a unitary system governed by majority rule.[214] Following the Boipatong massacre of ANC activists by government-aided Inkatha militants, Mandela called off the negotiations, before attending a meeting of the Organisation of African Unity in Senegal, at which he called for a special session of the UN Security Council and proposed that a UN peacekeeping force be stationed in South Africa to prevent "state terrorism". 
The UN sent special envoy Cyrus Vance to the country to aid negotiations.[215] Calling for domestic mass action, in August the ANC organised the largest-ever strike in South African history, and supporters marched on Pretoria.[216] 
The democratic process was threatened by the Concerned South Africans Group (COSAG), an alliance of far-right Afrikaner parties and black ethnic-secessionist groups like Inkatha; in June 1993, the white supremacist Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) attacked the Kempton Park World Trade Centre.[221] Following the murder of ANC leader Chris Hani, Mandela made a publicised speech to calm rioting, soon after appearing at a mass funeral in Soweto for Tambo, who had died from a stroke.[222] In July 1993, both Mandela and de Klerk visited the US, independently meeting President Bill Clinton and each receiving the Liberty Medal.[223] Soon after, Mandela and de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway.[224] Influenced by Thabo Mbeki, Mandela began meeting with big business figures, and played down his support for nationalisation, fearing that he would scare away much-needed foreign investment. Although criticised by socialist ANC members, he was encouraged to embrace private enterprise by members of the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist parties at the January 1992 World Economic Forum in Switzerland.[225] Mandela also made a cameo appearance as a schoolteacher reciting one of Malcolm X's speeches in the final scene of the 1992 film Malcolm X.[226] 
Following the Bisho massacre, in which 28 ANC supporters and one soldier were shot dead by the Ciskei Defence Force during a protest march, Mandela realised that mass action was leading to further violence and resumed negotiations in September. 
He agreed to do so on the conditions that all political prisoners be released, that Zulu traditional weapons be banned, and that Zulu hostels would be fenced off, the latter two measures to prevent further Inkatha attacks; under increasing pressure, de Klerk reluctantly agreed.[217] The negotiations agreed that a multiracial general election would be held, resulting in a five-year coalition government of national unity and a constitutional assembly that gave the National Party continuing influence. 
The ANC also conceded to safeguarding the jobs of white civil servants; such concessions brought fierce internal criticism.[218][217] The duo agreed on an interim constitution based on a liberal democratic model, guaranteeing separation of powers, creating a constitutional court, and including a US-style bill of rights; it also divided the country into nine provinces, each with its own premier and civil service, a concession between de Klerk's desire for federalism and Mandela's for unitary government.[219][220] 
With the election set for 27 April 1994, the ANC began campaigning, opening 100 election offices and orchestrating People's Forums across the country, at which Mandela could appear, as a popular figure with great status among black South Africans.[227] The ANC campaigned on a Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) to build a million houses in five years, introduce universal free education and extend access to water and electricity. 
The party's slogan was "a better life for all", although it was not explained how this development would be funded.[228] With the exception of the Weekly Mail and the New Nation, South Africa's press opposed Mandela's election, fearing continued ethnic strife, instead supporting the National or Democratic Party.[229] Mandela devoted much time to fundraising for the ANC, touring North America, Europe and Asia to meet wealthy donors, including former supporters of the apartheid regime.[230] He also urged a reduction in the voting age from 18 to 14; rejected by the ANC, this policy became the subject of ridicule.[231] 
General election: 1994 
Mandela casting his vote in the 1994 election 
The newly elected National Assembly's first act was to formally elect Mandela as South Africa's first black chief executive. 
His inauguration took place in Pretoria on 10 May 1994, televised to a billion viewers globally. 
The event was attended by 4000 guests, including world leaders from disparate backgrounds.[238] Mandela headed a Government of National Unity dominated by the ANC – which alone had no experience of governance – but containing representatives from the National Party and Inkatha. 
Under the Interim Constitution, Inkatha and the NP were entitled to seats in the government by virtue of winning at least 20 seats. 
In keeping with earlier agreements, de Klerk became first Deputy President, and Thabo Mbeki was selected as second.[239][240] Although Mbeki had not been his first choice for the job, Mandela grew to rely heavily on him throughout his presidency, allowing him to organise policy details.[241] Moving into the presidential office at Tuynhuys in Cape Town, Mandela allowed de Klerk to retain the presidential residence in the Groote Schuur estate, instead settling into the nearby Westbrooke manor, which he renamed "Genadendal", meaning "Valley of Mercy" in Afrikaans.[242] Retaining his Houghton home, he also had a house built in his home village of Qunu, which he visited regularly, walking around the area, meeting with locals, and judging tribal disputes.[243] 
Concerned that COSAG would undermine the election, particularly in the wake of the conflict in Bophuthatswana and the Shell House Massacre – incidents of violence involving the AWB and Inkatha, respectively – Mandela met with Afrikaner politicians and generals, including P. W. Botha, Pik Botha and Constand Viljoen, persuading many to work within the democratic system, and with de Klerk convinced Inkatha's Buthelezi to enter the elections rather than launch a war of secession.[232] As leaders of the two major parties, de Klerk and Mandela appeared on a televised debate; although de Klerk was widely considered the better speaker at the event, Mandela's offer to shake his hand surprised him, leading some commentators to consider it a victory for Mandela.[233] The election went ahead with little violence, although an AWB cell killed 20 with car bombs. 
As widely expected, the ANC won a sweeping victory, taking 63% of the vote, just short of the two-thirds majority needed to unilaterally change the constitution. 
The ANC was also victorious in seven provinces, with Inkatha and the National Party each taking another.[234][235] Mandela voted at the Ohlange High School in Durban, and though the ANC's victory assured his election as President, he publicly accepted that the election had been marred by instances of fraud and sabotage.[236][237] 
Presidency of South Africa: 1994–99 
Mandela moved into the presidential office at Tuynhuys, Cape Town. 
Aged 76, he faced various ailments, and although exhibiting continued energy, he felt isolated and lonely.[244] He often entertained celebrities, such as Michael Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg, and the Spice Girls, and befriended ultra-rich businessmen, like Harry Oppenheimer of Anglo-American, as well as Queen Elizabeth II on her March 1995 state visit to South Africa, resulting in strong criticism from ANC anti-capitalists.[245] Despite his opulent surroundings, Mandela lived simply, donating a third of his 552,000 rand annual income to the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, which he had founded in 1995.[246] Although dismantling press censorship, speaking out in favour of freedom of the press, and befriending many journalists, Mandela was critical of much of the country's media, noting that it was overwhelmingly owned and run by middle-class whites and believing that it focused too much on scaremongering around crime.[247] Changing clothes several times a day, after assuming the presidency, one of Mandela's trademarks was his use of Batik shirts, known as "Madiba shirts", even on formal occasions.[248][249] 
National reconciliation 
Presiding over the transition from apartheid minority rule to a multicultural democracy, Mandela saw national reconciliation as the primary task of his presidency.[254] Having seen other post-colonial African economies damaged by the departure of white elites, Mandela worked to reassure South Africa's white population that they were protected and represented in "the Rainbow Nation".[255] Although his Government of National Unity would be dominated by the ANC,[256] he attempted to create a broad coalition by appointing de Klerk as first Deputy President and appointing other National Party officials as ministers for Agriculture, Energy, Environment, and Minerals and Energy, as well as naming Buthelezi as Minister for Home Affairs.[257] The other cabinet positions were taken by ANC members, many of whom – like Joe Modise, Alfred Nzo, Joe Slovo, Mac Maharaj and Dullah Omar – had long been comrades, although others, such as Tito Mboweni and Jeff Radebe, were much younger.[230] Mandela's relationship with de Klerk was strained; Mandela thought that de Klerk was intentionally provocative, and de Klerk felt that he was being intentionally humiliated by the president.[258] In January 1995, Mandela heavily chastised him for awarding amnesty to 3,500 police just before the election, and later criticised him for defending former Minister of Defence Magnus Malan when the latter was charged with murder.[258] 
In December 1994, Mandela published Long Walk to Freedom, an autobiography based around a manuscript he had written in prison, augmented by interviews conducted with American journalist Richard Stengel.[250] In late 1994 he attended the 49th conference of the ANC in Bloemfontein, at which a more militant National Executive was elected, among them Winnie Mandela; although she expressed an interest in reconciling, Nelson initiated divorce proceedings in August 1995.[251] By 1995 he had entered into a relationship with Graça Machel, a Mozambican political activist 27 years his junior who was the widow of former president Samora Machel. 
They had first met in July 1990, when she was still in mourning, but their friendship grew into a partnership, with Machel accompanying him on many of his foreign visits. 
She turned down Mandela's first marriage proposal, wanting to retain some independence and dividing her time between Mozambique and Johannesburg.[252] 
Mandela personally met with senior figures of the apartheid regime, including Hendrik Verwoerd's widow Betsie Schoombie and the lawyer Percy Yutar, also laying a wreath by the statue of Afrikaner hero Daniel Theron.[259] Emphasising personal forgiveness and reconciliation, he announced that "courageous people do not fear forgiving, for the sake of peace."[260] He encouraged black South Africans to get behind the previously hated national rugby team, the Springboks, as South Africa hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup. 
After the Springboks won a celebrated final over New Zealand, Mandela presented the trophy to captain Francois Pienaar, an Afrikaner, wearing a Springbok shirt with Pienaar's own number 6 on the back. 
This was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black South Africans; as de Klerk later put it, "Mandela won the hearts of millions of white rugby fans."[261][262] Mandela's efforts at reconciliation assuaged the fears of whites, but also drew criticism from more militant blacks.[263] Among the latter was his estranged wife, Winnie, who accused the ANC of being more interested in appeasing the white community than in helping the black majority.[264] 
Mandela oversaw the formation of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate crimes committed under apartheid by both the government and the ANC, appointing Desmond Tutu as its chair. 
To prevent the creation of martyrs, the Commission granted individual amnesties in exchange for testimony of crimes committed during the apartheid era. 
Dedicated in February 1996, it held two years of hearings detailing rapes, torture, bombings, and assassinations, before issuing its final report in October 1998. Both de Klerk and Mbeki appealed to have parts of the report suppressed, though only de Klerk's appeal was successful.[265] Mandela praised the Commission's work, stating that it "had helped us move away from the past to concentrate on the present and the future".[266] 
Domestic programmes 
Houses in Soweto constructed under the RDP program 
Mandela's administration inherited a country with a huge disparity in wealth and services between white and black communities. Of a population of 40 million, around 23 million lacked electricity or adequate sanitation, 12 million lacked clean water supplies, with 2 million children not in school and a third of the population illiterate. 
There was 33% unemployment, and just under half of the population lived below the poverty line.[267] Government financial reserves were nearly depleted, with a fifth of the national budget being spent on debt repayment, meaning that the extent of the promised Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) was scaled back, with none of the proposed nationalisation or job creation.[268] In 1996, the RDP was replaced with a new policy, Growth, Employment and Redistribution (Gear), which maintained South Africa's mixed economy but placed an emphasis on economic growth through a framework of market economics and the encouragement of foreign investment; many in the ANC derided it as a neo-liberal policy that did not undermine social inequality, however Mandela defended it.[269] In adopting this approach, Mandela's government adhered to the "Washington consensus" advocated by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.[270] 
Under Mandela's presidency, welfare spending increased by 13% in 1996/97, 13% in 1997/98, and 7% in 1998/99.[271] The government introduced parity in grants for communities, including disability grants, child maintenance grants, and old-age pensions, which had previously been set at different levels for South Africa's different racial groups.[271] In 1994, free healthcare was introduced for children under six and pregnant women, a provision extended to all those using primary level public sector health care services in 1996.[272][273] By the 1999 election, the ANC could boast that due to their policies, 3 million people were connected to telephone lines, 1.5 million children were brought into the education system, 500 clinics were upgraded or constructed, 2 million people were connected to the electricity grid, water access was extended to 3 million people, and 750,000 houses were constructed, housing nearly 3 million people.[274] 
Mandela on a visit to Brazil in 1998 
The Land Restitution Act of 1994 enabled people who had lost their property as a result of the Natives Land Act, 1913 to claim back their land, leading to the settlement of tens of thousands of land claims.[275] The Land Reform Act 3 of 1996 safeguarded the rights of labour tenants who live and grow crops or graze livestock on farms. 
This legislation ensured that such tenants could not be evicted without a court order or if they were over the age of 65.[276] The Skills Development Act of 1998 provided for the establishment of mechanisms to finance and promote skills development at the workplace.[277] Recognising that arms manufacturing was a key industry in South Africa, Mandela endorsed the trade in weapons although brought in tighter regulations surrounding Armscor to ensure that South African weaponry was not sold to authoritarian regimes.[278] Under Mandela's administration, tourism was increasingly promoted, becoming a major sector for the South African economy.[279] 
Critics like Edwin Cameron accused Mandela's government of doing little to stem the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the country; by 1999, 10% of South Africa's population were HIV positive. 
Mandela later admitted that he had personally neglected the issue, in part due to public reticence in discussing issues surrounding sex in South Africa, and that he had instead left the issue for Mbeki to deal with.[280][281] Mandela also received criticism for failing to sufficiently combat crime, with South Africa having one of the world's highest crime rates,[282] while throughout the decade the activities of international crime syndicates grew significantly in the country.[283] Mandela's administration was also perceived as having failed to deal with the problem of corruption.[284] 
Further problems were caused by the exodus of thousands of skilled white South Africans from the country, who were escaping the increasing crime rates, higher taxes, and the impact of positive discrimination toward blacks in employment. 
This exodus resulted in a brain drain, with Mandela criticising those who left.[285][286] At the same time, South Africa experienced an influx of millions of illegal migrants from poorer parts of Africa; although public opinion toward these illegal immigrants was generally unfavourable, characterising them as disease-spreading criminals who were a drain on resources, Mandela called on South Africans to embrace them as "brothers and sisters".[287] 
Mandela attracted controversy for his close relationship with Indonesian President Suharto, whose regime was responsible for mass human rights abuses, although on a July 1997 visit to Indonesia he privately urged him to withdraw from the occupation of East Timor.[294] He also faced similar criticism from the West for his government's trade links to Syria, Cuba, and Libya,[295] and for his personal friendships with Fidel Castro and Muammar Gaddafi. 
Castro visited in 1998, to widespread popular acclaim, and Mandela met Gaddafi in Libya to award him the Order of Good Hope.[296] When Western governments and media criticised these visits, Mandela lambasted such criticism as having racist undertones,[297] and stated that "the enemies of countries in the West are not our enemies."[295] Mandela hoped to resolve the long-running dispute between Libya and the US and Britain over bringing to trial the two Libyans, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, who were indicted in November 1991 and accused of sabotaging Pan Am Flight 103. 
Mandela proposed that they be tried in a third country, which was agreed to by all parties; governed by Scots law, the trial was held at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands in April 1999, and found one of the two men guilty.[298][299] 
Foreign affairs 
Mandela expressed the view that "South Africa's future foreign relations [should] be based on our belief that human rights should be the core of international relations".[288] Following the South African example, Mandela encouraged other nations to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and reconciliation.[289] In September 1998, Mandela was appointed Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement, who held their annual conference in Durban. 
He used the event to criticise the "narrow, chauvinistic interests" of the Israeli government in stalling negotiations to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and urged India and Pakistan to negotiate to end the Kashmir conflict, for which he was criticised by both Israel and India.[290] Inspired by the region's economic boom, Mandela sought greater economic relations with East Asia, in particular with Malaysia, although this was scuppered by the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[291] He attempted to overcome the 'Two China Problem' by extending diplomatic recognition to both the People's Republic of China (PRC), who were growing as an economic force, and Taiwan, who were already longstanding investors in the South African economy. 
However, under pressure from the PRC, in November 1996 he cut recognition of Taiwan, and in May 1999 paid an official visit to Beijing.[292] 
Mandela with US President Bill Clinton. 
Despite publicly criticising him on several occasions, Mandela liked Clinton, and personally supported him during his impeachment proceedings.[293] 
Mandela echoed Mbeki's calls for an "African Renaissance", and was greatly concerned with issues on the continent.[300] He took a soft diplomatic approach to removing Sani Abacha's military junta in Nigeria but later became a leading figure in calling for sanctions when Abacha's regime increased human rights violations.[301] In 1996 he was appointed Chairman of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and initiated unsuccessful negotiations to end the First Congo War in Zaire.[302] He also played a key role as a mediator in the ethnic conflict between Tutsi and Hutu political groups in the Burundian Civil War, helping to initiate a settlement which brought increased stability to the country but which did not end the ethnic violence.[303] In South Africa's first post-apartheid military operation, in September 1998 it ordered troops into Lesotho in order to protect the government of Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili after a disputed election prompted opposition uprisings. 
The action was not authorised by Mandela himself, who was out of the country at the time, but by Buthelezi, who was serving as acting president during Mandela's absence.[304] 
Retirement 
Continued activism and philanthropy: 1999–2004 
Retiring in June 1999, Mandela sought a quiet family life, to be divided between Johannesburg and Qunu. 
He set about authoring a sequel to his first autobiography, to be titled The Presidential Years, but it was abandoned before publication.[318] Finding such seclusion difficult, he reverted to a busy public life with a daily programme of tasks, meeting with world leaders and celebrities, and when in Johannesburg worked with the Nelson Mandela Foundation, founded in 1999 to focus on rural development, school construction, and combating HIV/AIDS.[319] Although he had been heavily criticised for failing to do enough to fight the pandemic during his presidency, he devoted much of his time to the issue following his retirement, describing it as "a war" that had killed more than "all previous wars"; affiliating himself with the Treatment Action Campaign, he urged Mbeki's government to ensure that HIV+ South Africans had access to anti-retrovirals.[320] In 2000, the Nelson Mandela Invitational charity golf tournament was founded, hosted by Gary Player.[321] Mandela was successfully treated for prostate cancer in July 2001.[322][323] 
Withdrawing from politics 
In the latter part of his presidency, Mandela increasingly relied on his Deputy President, Thabo Mbeki (pictured) 
The new Constitution of South Africa was agreed upon by parliament in May 1996, enshrining a series of institutions to check political and administrative authority within a constitutional democracy.[305] De Klerk opposed the implementation of this constitution, and that month he and the National Party withdrew from the coalition government in protest, claiming that the ANC were not treating them as equals.[306] The ANC took over the cabinet positions formerly held by the Nationalists, with Mbeki becoming sole Deputy President.[307] Inkatha remained part of the coalition,[308] and when both Mandela and Mbeki were out of the country in September 1998, Buthelezi was appointed "Acting President", marking an improvement in his relationship with Mandela.[309] Although Mandela had often governed decisively in his first two years as President,[310] he had increasingly delegated duties to Mbeki after that, only retaining a close personal supervision of intelligence and security measures.[311] On a 1997 visit to London, he said that "the ruler of South Africa, the de facto ruler, is Thabo Mbeki. I am shifting everything to him."[310] 
Mandela stepped down as ANC President at the party's December 1997 conference. 
He hoped that Ramaphosa would succeed him, believing Mbeki to be too inflexible and intolerant of criticism, but the ANC elected Mbeki regardless.[312] Replacing Mbeki as Deputy President, Mandela and the Executive supported the candidacy of Jacob Zuma, a Zulu who had been imprisoned on Robben Island, but he was challenged by Winnie, whose populist rhetoric had gained her a strong following within the party; Zuma defeated her in a landslide victory vote at the election.[313] 
Mandela's relationship with Machel had intensified; in February 1998 he publicly stated that "I'm in love with a remarkable lady", and under pressure from his friend Desmond Tutu, who urged him to set an example for young people, he organised a wedding for his 80th birthday, in July.[314] The following day he held a grand party with many foreign dignitaries.[315] Although the 1996 constitution allowed the president to serve two consecutive five-year terms, Mandela had never planned on standing for a second term in office. 
He gave his farewell speech to Parliament on 29 March 1999 when it adjourned prior the 1999 general elections, after which he retired.[316] Although opinion polls in South Africa showed wavering support for both the ANC and the government, Mandela himself remained highly popular, with 80% of South Africans polled in 1999 expressing satisfaction with his performance as president.[317] 
Mandela visiting the London School of Economics in 2000 
In 2002, Mandela inaugurated the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, and in 2003 the Mandela Rhodes Foundation was created at Rhodes House, University of Oxford, to provide postgraduate scholarships to African students. 
These projects were followed by the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory and the 46664 campaign against HIV/AIDS.[324] He gave the closing address at the XIII International AIDS Conference in Durban in 2000,[325] and in 2004, spoke at the XV International AIDS Conference in Bangkok, Thailand.[326] 
Nelson Mandela and President George W. Bush in the Oval Office, May 2005 
Publicly, Mandela became more vocal in criticising Western powers. 
He strongly opposed the 1999 NATO intervention in Kosovo and called it an attempt by the world's powerful nations to police the entire world.[327] In 2003, he spoke out against the plans for the US and UK to launch the War in Iraq, describing it as "a tragedy" and lambasting US President George W. Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair for undermining the UN, saying "All that (Mr. Bush) wants is Iraqi oil".[328] He attacked the US more generally, asserting that it had committed more "unspeakable atrocities" across the world than any other nation, citing the atomic bombing of Japan; this attracted international controversy, although he later reconciled his relationship with Blair.[329][330] Retaining an interest in Libyan-UK relations, he visited Megrahi in Barlinnie prison and spoke out against the conditions of his treatment, referring to them as "psychological persecution".[331] 
"Retiring from retirement": 2004–13<span id=""Retiring from retirement": 2004–2013"> 
In June 2004, aged 85 and amid failing health, Mandela announced that he was "retiring from retirement" and retreating from public life, remarking "Don't call me, I will call you."[332][333] Although continuing to meet with close friends and family, the Foundation discouraged invitations for him to appear at public events and denied most interview requests.[322] 
He retained some involvement in international affairs. 
In 2005, he founded the Nelson Mandela Legacy Trust,[334] travelling to the U.S., to speak before the Brookings Institution and the NAACP on the need for economic assistance to Africa.[334][335] He spoke with U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton and President George W. Bush and first met then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama.[335] Mandela also encouraged Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe to resign over growing human rights abuses in the country. 
When this proved ineffective, he spoke out publicly against Mugabe in 2007, asking him to step down "with residual respect and a modicum of dignity."[336] That year, Mandela, Machel, and Desmond Tutu convened a group of world leaders in Johannesburg to contribute their wisdom and independent leadership to some of the world's toughest problems. 
Mandela announced the formation of this new group, The Elders, in a speech delivered on his 89th birthday.[337] 
Mandela meeting with Australian Governor-General Quentin Bryce in March 2009. 
Mandela's 90th birthday was marked across the country on 18 July 2008, with the main celebrations held at Qunu,[338] and a concert in his honour in Hyde Park, London.[339] In a speech marking the event, Mandela called for the rich to help the poor across the world.[338] Throughout Mbeki's presidency, Mandela continued to support the ANC, although usually overshadowed Mbeki at any public events that the two attended. 
Mandela was more at ease with Mbeki's successor Jacob Zuma,[340] although the Nelson Mandela Foundation were upset when his grandson, Mandla Mandela, flew him out to the Eastern Cape to attend a pro-Zuma rally in the midst of a storm in 2009.[340] 
In 2004, Mandela successfully campaigned for South Africa to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup, declaring that there would be "few better gifts for us" in the year marking a decade since the fall of apartheid.[341] Mandela emotionally raised the FIFA World Cup Trophy after South Africa was awarded host status.[342] Despite maintaining a low profile during the event due to ill-health, Mandela made his final public appearance during the World Cup closing ceremony, where he received a "rapturous reception".[343][344] Between 2005 and 2013, Mandela, and later his family, were embroiled in a series of legal disputes regarding money held in family trusts for the benefit of his descendants.[345] In mid-2013, as Mandela was hospitalised for a lung infection in Pretoria, his descendants were involved in intra-family legal dispute relating to the burial place of Mandela's children, and ultimately Mandela himself.[346][347][348] 
Illness and death: 2011–2013

In February 2011, he was briefly hospitalised with a respiratory infection, attracting international attention,[349] before being re-hospitalised for a lung infection and gallstone removal in December 2012.[350] After a successful medical procedure in early March 2013,[351] his lung infection recurred, and he was briefly hospitalised in Pretoria.[352] On 8 June 2013, his lung infection worsened, and he was rehospitalised in Pretoria in a serious condition.[353] On 23 June 2013, Zuma announced that Mandela's condition had become "critical".[354][355][356] Zuma, accompanied by the Deputy President of the ANC, Cyril Ramaphosa, met Mandela's wife Graça Machel at the hospital in Pretoria and discussed his condition.[357] On 25 June Cape Town Archbishop Thabo Makgoba visited Mandela at the hospital and prayed with Graça Machel Mandela "at this hard time of watching and waiting".[358] The next day, Zuma visited Mandela in the hospital and cancelled a visit scheduled for the next day to Mozambique.[359] In September 2013, Mandela was discharged from hospital,[360] although his condition remained unstable.[361] 
After suffering from a prolonged respiratory infection, Mandela died on 5 December 2013 at the age of 95. 
He died at around 20:50 local time (UTC+2) at his home in Houghton, Johannesburg, surrounded by his family.[362] Zuma publicly announced his death on television.[362][363] Zuma proclaimed a national mourning period of ten days, with 8 December a national day of prayer and reflection, and a main event held at Johannesburg's FNB Stadium on 10 December 2013. 
Mandela's body lay in state from 11 to 13 December at the Union Buildings in Pretoria and a state funeral was held on 15 December in Qunu.[364][365] Approximately 90 representatives of foreign states travelled to South Africa to attend memorial events.[366][367] Tributes to Mandela and images of him proliferated across social media like Facebook.[368] Mandela's $4.1 million estate was left to his widow, other family members, staff, and educational institutions.[369] 
"Free Mandela" protest in East Berlin, 1986 
Political ideology 
Mandela was a practical politician, rather than an intellectual scholar or political theorist.[371] According to biographer Tom Lodge, "for Mandela, politics has always been primarily about enacting stories, about making narratives, primarily about morally exemplary conduct, and only secondarily about ideological vision, more about means rather than ends."[372] Mandela identified as both an African nationalist, an ideological position he held since joining the ANC,[373] and a democratic socialist.[374] He advocated the ultimate establishment of a classless society,[375] with Sampson describing him as "openly opposed to capitalism, private land-ownership and the power of big money".[376] 
Mandela was influenced by Marxism, and during the revolution he advocated scientific socialism.[377] During the Treason Trial, he denied being a communist,[378] maintaining this stance when later talking to journalists.[379] Conversely, biographer David Jones Smith stated that Mandela "embraced communism and communists" in the late 1950s and early 1960s,[380] while historian Stephen Ellis found evidence that Mandela had been an active member of the South African Communist Party (SACP).[116] This was confirmed after his death by the SACP and the ANC. 
According to the SACP, he was not only a member of the party, but also served on the party's Central Committee.[117] 
In the 1955 Freedom Charter, which Mandela had helped create, it called for the nationalisation of banks, gold mines, and land, believing this necessary to ensure equal distribution of wealth.[381] Despite these beliefs, Mandela initiated a programme of privatisation during his presidency, in line with trends in other countries of the time.[382] It has been repeatedly suggested that Mandela would have preferred to develop a social democratic economy in South Africa but that this was not feasible as a result of the international political and economic situation during the early 1990s.[382] This decision was in part influenced by the fall of the socialist states in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc during the early 1990s.[383] In contrast, China was developing rapidly within a "socialist market economy", and Mandela began to quote Deng Xiaoping's aphorism: "It doesn't matter whether a cat is black or white, so long as it catches mice."[384] 
His official biographer Anthony Sampson commented that he was a "master of imagery and performance", excelling at presenting himself well in press photographs and producing soundbites.[402] His public speeches were presented in a formal, stiff manner, and often consisted of clichéd set phrases.[403] Although not considered a great orator, his speeches conveyed "his personal commitment, charm and humour".[404] In describing his life, Mandela stated that "I was not a messiah, but an ordinary man who had become a leader because of extraordinary circumstances."[405] 
Mandela was a private person who often concealed his emotions and confided in very few people.[406] Privately, he lived an austere life, refusing to drink alcohol or smoke, and even as President made his own bed.[407] Renowned for his mischievous sense of humour,[408] he was known for being both stubborn and loyal,[409] and at times exhibited a quick temper.[407] He was typically friendly and welcoming, and appeared relaxed in conversation with everyone, including his opponents.[410] Constantly polite and courteous, he was attentive to all, irrespective of their age or status, and often talked to children or servants.[411] He was known for ability to find common ground with very different communities.[412] In later life he always looked for the best in people, even defending political opponents to his allies, who sometimes thought him too trusting of others.[413] He was raised into the Methodist denomination of Christianity, with the Methodist Church of Southern Africa claiming that he retained his allegiance to them throughout his life.[414] An analysis of his writings have led to him being described by theologian Dion Forster as a Christian humanist, who relied more upon Ubuntu than Christian theology.[415] According to Sampson, Mandela however never had "a strong religious faith",[416] while Boehmer stated that Mandela's religious belief was "never robust".[417] He was fond of Indian cuisine,[418] and had a lifelong interest in archaeology.[419] 
Over the course of his life, he began by advocating a path of non-violence, later embracing violence, and then adopting a non-violent approach to negotiation and reconciliation.[385] When endorsing violence, he did so because he saw no alternative, and was always pragmatic about, it, perceiving it as a means for getting his opponent to the negotiating table.[386] 
Mandela took political ideas from other thinkers, among them Indian independence leaders like Gandhi and Nehru, African-American activists, and African nationalists like Nkrumah, and fitted them into the South African situation. 
At the same time he rejected aspects of their thought, such as the anti-white sentiment of many African nationalists.[387] He also synthesized both counter-cultural and hegemonic views, for instance by drawing upon ideas from Afrikaner nationalism.[388] Although he presented himself in an autocratic manner in several speeches, he was a devout believer in democracy and abided by majority decisions even when deeply disagreeing with them.[389] His political thought nevertheless exhibited tensions between his support for liberal democracy and pre-colonial African forms of consensus decision making.[390] He held a conviction that "inclusivity, accountability and freedom of speech" were the fundamentals of democracy,[391] and was driven by a belief in natural and human rights,[392] pursuing not only racial equality but also promoting gay rights as part of the post-apartheid reforms.[393] His political development was strongly influenced by his legal training and practice, in particular his hope to achieve change not through violence but through "legal revolution".[394] 
Personality and personal life 
Mandela was widely considered a charismatic leader,[396] with biographer Mary Benson describing him as having been "a born mass leader who could not help magnetizing people".[397] He was highly image conscious, and throughout his life always sought out fine quality clothes, with many commentators believing that he carried himself in a regal manner.[398] His aristocratic heritage was repeatedly emphasised by supporters, thus contributing to his "charismatic power".[399] While living in Johannesburg in the 1950s, he cultivated the image of the "African gentleman", having "the pressed clothes, correct manners, and modulated public speech" associated with such a position.[400] In doing so, Lodge argued that Mandela became "one of the first media politicians... embodying a glamour and a style that projected visually a brave new African world of modernity and freedom".[372] In the 1990s he came to be associated closely with the highly coloured "Madiba shirts" that he began wearing.[401]

Mandela was heterosexual,[420] with biographer Fatima Meer stating that he was "easily tempted" by women.[421] Another biographer, Martin Meredith, characterised him as being "by nature a romantic", highlighting that he had relationships with various women.[422] Mandela was married three times, fathered six children, and had seventeen grandchildren[423][424] and many great-grandchildren.[425] He could be stern and demanding of his children, although he was more affectionate with his grandchildren.[426] His first marriage was to Evelyn Ntoko Mase in October 1944;[427] they divorced after 13 years in 1957 under the multiple strains of his adultery and constant absences, devotion to revolutionary agitation, and the fact that she was a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses, a religion requiring political neutrality.[428] The couple had two sons whom Mandela survived, Madiba "Thembi" Thembekile (1945–1969) and Makgatho Mandela (1950–2005); his first son died in a car crash, and his second son died of AIDS. 
The couple had two daughters, both named Makaziwe Mandela (born 1947 and 1954); the first died at the age of nine months, the second, known as "Maki", survived Mandela.[429] Makgatho's son, Mandla Mandela, became chief of the Mvezo tribal council in 2007.[430] 
By the time of his death, within South Africa Mandela was widely considered both "the father of the nation",[434] and "the founding father of democracy",[435] being seen as "the national liberator, the saviour, its Washington and Lincoln rolled into one".[436] Outside of South Africa, he was a "global icon", with the scholar of South African studies Rita Barnard describing him as "one of the most revered figures of our time".[437] One biographer considered him "a modern democratic hero",[438] while his popularity had resulted in a cult of personality building up around him.[439] He is often cited alongside Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. as one of the 20th century's exemplary anti-racist and anti-colonial leaders.[440] Boehmer described him as "a totem of the totemic values of our age: toleration and liberal democracy",[441] and "a universal symbol of social justice".[442] 
Mandela's second wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, also came from the Transkei area, although they, too, met in Johannesburg, where she was the city's first black social worker.[98] They had two daughters, Zenani (Zeni), born 4 February 1959, and Zindziswa (Zindzi) Mandela-Hlongwane, born 1960.[431] Zindzi was only 18 months old when her father was sent to Robben Island. 
Later, Winnie was deeply torn by family discord which mirrored the country's political strife; separation (April 1992) and divorce (March 1996), fuelled by political estrangement.[432] Mandela's third wife was Graça Machel (née Simbine), whom he married on his 80th birthday in 1998.[433] 
Reception and legacy 
Flowers left at the Mandela statue in London's Parliament Square following his death 
On 16 December 2013, Day of Reconciliation, a 9-metre-high, bronze statue of Mandela was unveiled at the Union Buildings by President Jacob Zuma.[454] In 2004, Johannesburg granted Mandela the freedom of the city,[455] and the Sandton Square shopping centre was renamed Nelson Mandela Square, after a Mandela statue was installed there.[456] In 2008, another Mandela statue was unveiled at Drakenstein Correctional Centre, formerly Victor Verster Prison, near Cape Town, standing on the spot where Mandela was released from the prison.[457] 
Mandela's international fame had emerged during his incarceration in the 1980s, when he became the world's most famous prisoner, a symbol of the anti-apartheid cause, and an icon for millions who embraced the ideal of human equality.[253] In 1986, Mandela biographer Mary Benson characterised him as "the embodiment of the struggle for liberation" in South Africa.[443] Meredith stated that in becoming "a potent symbol of resistance" to apartheid during the 1980s, he had gained "mythical status" internationally.[444] Sampson commented that even during his life, this myth had become "so powerful that it blurs the realities", converting Mandela into "a secular saint".[445] Within a decade after the end of his Presidency, Mandela's era was being widely thought of as "a golden age of hope and harmony",[446] with much nostalgia being expressed for it.[447] Across the world, Mandela earned international acclaim for his activism in overcoming apartheid and fostering racial reconciliation,[407] coming to be viewed as "a moral authority" with a great "concern for truth".[448] 
Mandela generated controversy throughout his career as an activist and politician,[439] having detractors on both the radical left and the right.[449] Some voices in the ANC accused him of selling out for agreeing to enter negotiations with the apartheid government.[439] Concerns were raised that the personal respect and authority he accrued were in contrast to the ideals of democracy that he promoted.[439] His government would be criticised for its failure to deal with the HIV/AIDS pandemic and promote an economic model that benefited South Africa's poor.[439] During the 1980s, Mandela was widely labelled a terrorist by prominent political figures in the Western world for his embrace of political violence.[450] Thatcher attracted international attention for describing the ANC as "a typical terrorist organisation" in 1987;[451] although she later called on Botha to release Mandela.[452] Mandela has also been criticised for his friendship with political leaders such as Castro, Gaddafi, and Suharto – deemed dictators by critics – as well as his refusal to condemn their human rights violations.[453] 
Orders, decorations, and monuments

In 1993, he received the joint Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk.[458] In November 2009, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed Mandela's birthday, 18 July, as "Mandela Day", marking his contribution to the anti-apartheid struggle. 
It called on individuals to donate 67 minutes to doing something for others, commemorating the 67 years that Mandela had been a part of the movement.[459] 
Awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom[460] and appointment to the Order of Canada,[461] he was also the first living person to be made an honorary Canadian citizen.[462] Mandela was the last recipient of the Soviet Union's Lenin Peace Prize[463] and the first recipient of the Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights.[464] In 1990, he received the Bharat Ratna Award from the government of India[465] and, in 1992, received Pakistan's Nishan-e-Pakistan.[466] The same year, he was awarded the Atatürk Peace Award by Turkey; he at first refused the award, citing human rights violations committed by Turkey at the time,[467] but later accepted the award in 1999.[463] Queen Elizabeth II appointed him as a Bailiff Grand Cross of the Order of St. John (upon the recommendation of the order's Honours and Awards Committee) and granted him membership in the Order of Merit (a personal gift of the monarch).[468] 
Biographies and popular media 
The first biography of Mandela was authored by Mary Benson, based on brief interviews with him that she had conducted in the 1960s.[469] Two 'authorised' biographies were later produced by friends of Mandela.[470] The first was Fatima Meer's Higher Than Hope, which was heavily influenced by Winnie and thus placed great emphasis on Mandela's family.[471] The second was Anthony Sampson's Mandela published in 1999.[470] Other biographies included Martin Meredith's Mandela, first published in 1997, and Tom Lodge's Mandela, brought out in 2006.[470] 
Since the late 1980s, Mandela's image began to appear on a proliferation of items, among them "photographs, paintings, drawings, statues, public murals, buttons, t-shirts, refrigerator magnets, and more",[368] items that have been characterised as "Mandela kitsch".[472] Following his death, the internet began to contain many memes featuring images of Mandela with his inspirational quotes superimposed onto them.[368] 
Many artists have dedicated songs to Mandela. 
One of the most popular was from The Special AKA who recorded the song "Free Nelson Mandela" in 1983, which Elvis Costello also recorded and had a hit with. 
Stevie Wonder dedicated his 1985 Oscar for the song "I Just Called to Say I Love You" to Mandela, resulting in his music being banned by the South African Broadcasting Corporation.[473] 
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (/mænˈdɛlə/;[1] 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, politician, and philanthropist, who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. 
He was the country's first black chief executive, and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. 
His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid through tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation. 
Politically an African nationalist and democratic socialist, he served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997. 
A Xhosa born to the Thembu royal family, Mandela attended Fort Hare University and the University of Witwatersrand, where he studied law. 
Living in Johannesburg, he became involved in anti-colonial politics, joining the ANC and becoming a founding member of its Youth League. 
After the Afrikaner minority government of the National Party established apartheid – a system of racial segregation that privileged whites – in 1948, he rose to prominence in the ANC's 1952 anti-apartheid Defiance Campaign, was appointed superintendent of the organisation's Transvaal branch, and presided over the 1955 Congress of the People. 
Working as a lawyer, he was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and, with the ANC leadership, was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the Treason Trial from 1956 to 1961. 
Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the South African Communist Party (SACP). 
Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961, leading a sabotage campaign against the government. 
In 1962, he was arrested, convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the state, and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Rivonia Trial. 
Mandela served 27 years in prison, initially on Robben Island, and later in Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. 
Amid international pressure and growing fear of a racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. 
Mandela and de Klerk negotiated an end to apartheid and organised the 1994 multiracial elections, in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president. 
Leading a broad coalition government, which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. 
While continuing with the former government's economic liberalism, his administration introduced measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services. 
Internationally, he acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as Secretary General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998–99. 
Declining a second presidential term, he was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. 
Mandela became an elder statesman, focusing on charitable work in combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the Nelson Mandela Foundation. 
Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. 
Critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist, while those on the radical left deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters. 
Conversely, he gained international acclaim for his activism, having received more than 250 honours, including the Nobel Peace Prize, the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Soviet Lenin Peace Prize. 
He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his Xhosa clan name, Madiba, or as Tata ("Father"), and described as the "Father of the Nation". 
Early life 
Childhood: 1918–34 
Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then a part of South Africa's Cape Province.[2] Given the forename Rolihlahla, a Xhosa term colloquially meaning "troublemaker",[3] in later years he became known by his clan name, Madiba.[4] His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was ruler of the Thembu people in the Transkeian Territories of South Africa's modern Eastern Cape province.[5] One of this king's sons, named Mandela, became Nelson's grandfather and the source of his surname.[6] Because Mandela was only the king's child by a wife of the Ixhiba clan, a so-called "Left-Hand House", the descendants of his cadet branch of the royal family were morganatic, ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary royal councillors.[7] His father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa, was a local chief and councillor to the monarch; he had been appointed to the position in 1915, after his predecessor was accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate.[8] In 1926 Gadla was also sacked for corruption, but Nelson was told that he had lost his job for standing up to the magistrate's unreasonable demands.[9] A devotee of the god Qamata,[10] Gadla was a polygamist, having four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who lived in different villages. 
Nelson's mother was Gadla's third wife, Nosekeni Fanny, who was daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand House and a member of the amaMpemvu clan of Xhosa.[11] 
Later stating that his early life was dominated by traditional Thembu custom and taboo,[13] Mandela grew up with two sisters in his mother's kraal in the village of Qunu, where he tended herds as a cattle-boy, spending much time outside with other boys.[14] Both his parents were illiterate, but being a devout Christian, his mother sent him to a local Methodist school when he was about seven. 
Baptised a Methodist, Mandela was given the English forename of "Nelson" by his teacher.[15] When Mandela was about nine, his father came to stay at Qunu, where he died of an undiagnosed ailment which Mandela believed to be lung disease.[16] Feeling "cut adrift", he later said that he inherited his father's "proud rebelliousness" and "stubborn sense of fairness".[17] 
Mandela's mother took him to the "Great Place" palace at Mqhekezweni, where he was entrusted under the guardianship of Thembu regent, Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo. 
Although he did not see his mother again for many years, Mandela felt that Jongintaba and his wife Noengland treated him as their own child, raising him alongside their son Justice and daughter Nomafu.[18] As Mandela attended church services every Sunday with his guardians, Christianity became a significant part of his life.[19] He attended a Methodist mission school located next to the palace, studying English, Xhosa, history and geography.[20] He developed a love of African history, listening to the tales told by elderly visitors to the palace, and became influenced by the anti-imperialist rhetoric of the visiting Chief Joyi.[21] At the time he nevertheless considered the European colonialists not as oppressors but as benefactors who had brought education and other benefits to southern Africa.[22] Aged 16, he, Justice and several other boys travelled to Tyhalarha to undergo the circumcision ritual that symbolically marked their transition from boys to men; the rite over, he was given the name Dalibunga.[23]

Clarkebury, Healdtown, and Fort Hare: 1934–40

Intending to gain skills needed to become a privy councillor for the Thembu royal house, Mandela began his secondary education at Clarkebury Methodist High School Engcobo, a Western-style institution that was the largest school for black Africans in Thembuland.[24] Made to socialise with other students on an equal basis, he claimed that he lost his "stuck up" attitude, becoming best friends with a girl for the first time; he began playing sports and developed his lifelong love of gardening.[25] Completing his Junior Certificate in two years,[26] in 1937 he moved to Healdtown, the Methodist college in Fort Beaufort attended by most Thembu royalty, including Justice.[27] The headmaster emphasised the superiority of English culture and government, but Mandela became increasingly interested in native African culture, making his first non-Xhosa friend, a Sotho language-speaker, and coming under the influence of one of his favourite teachers, a Xhosa who broke taboo by marrying a Sotho.[28] Spending much of his spare time long-distance running and boxing, in his second year Mandela became a prefect.[29] 
With Jongintaba's backing, Mandela began work on a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree at the University of Fort Hare, an elite black institution in Alice, Eastern Cape, with around 150 students. 
There he studied English, anthropology, politics, native administration, and Roman Dutch law in his first year, desiring to become an interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs Department.[30] Mandela stayed in the Wesley House dormitory, befriending his own kinsman, K. D. Matanzima, as well as Oliver Tambo, who became a close friend and comrade for decades to come.[31] Continuing his interest in sport, Mandela took up ballroom dancing,[32] performed in a drama society play about Abraham Lincoln,[33] and gave Bible classes in the local community as part of the Students Christian Association.[34] Although having friends connected to the African National Congress (ANC) and the anti-imperialist movement who wanted South Africa to be independent of the British Empire, Mandela avoided any involvement,[35] and became a vocal supporter of the British war effort when the Second World War broke out.[36] Helping found a first-year students' house committee which challenged the dominance of the second-years,[37] at the end of his first year he became involved in a Students' Representative Council (SRC) boycott against the quality of food, for which he was temporarily suspended from the university; he left without receiving a degree.[38] 
Arriving in Johannesburg: 1941–43 
Returning to Mqhekezweni in December 1940, Mandela found that Jongintaba had arranged marriages for him and Justice; dismayed, they fled to Johannesburg via Queenstown, arriving in April 1941.[39] Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines, his "first sight of South African capitalism in action", but was fired when the induna (headman) discovered that he was a runaway.[40] Staying with a cousin in George Goch Township, Mandela was introduced to the realtor and ANC activist Walter Sisulu, who secured him a job as an articled clerk at law firm Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman. 
The company was run by a liberal Jew, Lazar Sidelsky, who was sympathetic to the ANC's cause.[41] At the firm, Mandela befriended Gaur Radebe, a Xhosa member of the ANC and Communist Party, as well as Nat Bregman, a Jewish communist who became his first white friend.[42] Attending communist talks and parties, Mandela was impressed that Europeans, Africans, Indians and Coloureds were mixing as equals. 
He stated later that he did not join the Party because its atheism conflicted with his Christian faith, and because he saw the South African struggle as being racially based rather than class warfare.[43] Continuing his higher education, Mandela signed up to a University of South Africa correspondence course, working on his bachelor's degree at night.[44] 
Earning a small wage, Mandela rented a room in the house of the Xhoma family in the Alexandra township; despite being rife with poverty, crime and pollution, Alexandra always remained a special place for him.[45] Although embarrassed by his poverty, he briefly courted a Swazi woman before unsuccessfully courting his landlord's daughter.[46] In order to save money and be closer to downtown Johannesburg, Mandela moved into the compound of the Witwatersrand Native Labour Association, living among miners of various tribes; as the compound was visited by various chiefs, he once met the Queen Regent of Basutoland.[47] In late 1941, Jongintaba visited, forgiving Mandela for running away. 
On returning to Thembuland, the regent died in winter 1942; Mandela and Justice arrived a day late for the funeral.[48] After passing his BA exams in early 1943, Mandela returned to Johannesburg to follow a political path as a lawyer rather than become a privy councillor in Thembuland.[49] He later stated that he experienced no epiphany, but that he "simply found myself doing so, and could not do otherwise."[50] 
Revolutionary activity 
Law studies and the ANC Youth League: 1943–49 
Mandela began studying law at the University of Witwatersrand, where he was the only black African student in the faculty. 
Although facing racism from some, he befriended liberal and communist European, Jewish, and Indian students, among them Joe Slovo and Ruth First.[51] Becoming increasingly politicised, in August 1943 Mandela marched in support of a successful bus boycott to reverse fare rises.[52] Joining the ANC, he was increasingly influenced by Sisulu, spending much time with other activists at Sisulu's Orlando house, including old friend Oliver Tambo.[53] In 1943, Mandela met Anton Lembede, an ANC member affiliated with the Africanist wing of African nationalism, which was virulently opposed to a racially united front against colonialism and imperialism or to an alliance with the communists.[54] Despite his friendships with non-blacks and communists, Mandela embraced Lembede's views, believing that black Africans should be entirely independent in their struggle for political self-determination.[55] Deciding on the need for a youth wing to mass mobilise Africans in opposition to their subjugation, Mandela was among a delegation that approached ANC President Alfred Bitini Xuma on the subject at his home in Sophiatown; the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) was founded on Easter Sunday 1944 in the Bantu Men's Social Centre in Eloff Street, with Lembede as President and Mandela as a member of its executive committee.[56]

At Sisulu's house, Mandela met Evelyn Mase, a trainee nurse and ANC activist from Engcobo, Transkei. 
Entering a relationship and marrying in October 1944, they initially lived with her relatives until moving in to a rented house in Orlando in early 1946.[58] Their first child, Madiba "Thembi" Thembekile, was born in February 1945; a daughter, Makaziwe, was born in 1947 but died of meningitis nine months later.[59] Mandela enjoyed home life, welcoming his mother and sister Leabie to stay with him.[60] In early 1947, his three years of articles ended at Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman, and he decided to become a full-time student, subsisting on loans from the Bantu Welfare Trust.[61] 
In July 1947, Mandela rushed Lembede, who was ill, to hospital, where he died; he was succeeded as ANCYL president by the more moderate Peter Mda, who agreed to co-operate with communists and non-blacks, appointing Mandela ANCYL secretary.[62] Mandela disagreed with Mda's approach, in December 1947 supporting an unsuccessful measure to expel communists from the ANCYL, considering their ideology un-African.[63] In 1947, Mandela was elected to the executive committee of the ANC's Transvaal Province branch, serving under regional president C. S. Ramohanoe. 
When Ramohanoe acted against the wishes of the committee by co-operating with Indians and communists, Mandela was one of those who forced his resignation.[64] 
In the South African general election, 1948, in which only whites were permitted to vote, the Afrikaner-dominated Herenigde Nasionale Party under Daniel François Malan took power, soon uniting with the Afrikaner Party to form the National Party. 
Openly racialist, the party codified and expanded racial segregation with the new apartheid legislation.[65] Gaining increasing influence in the ANC, Mandela and his cadres began advocating direct action against apartheid, such as boycotts and strikes, influenced by the tactics already employed by South Africa's Indian community. 
Xuma did not support these measures and was removed from the presidency in a vote of no confidence, replaced by James Moroka and a more militant executive containing Sisulu, Mda, Tambo and Godfrey Pitje.[66] Mandela later related that "We had now guided the ANC to a more radical and revolutionary path."[67] Having devoted his time to politics, Mandela failed his final year at Witwatersrand three times; he was ultimately denied his degree in December 1949.[68] 
Defiance Campaign and Transvaal ANC Presidency: 1950–54 
The ANC's tricolour flag; black for the people, green for the land, and gold for the resources of Africa[69] 
Mandela took Xuma's place on the ANC national executive in March 1950,[70] and that same year was elected national president of the ANCYL.[71] In March, the Defend Free Speech Convention was held in Johannesburg, bringing together African, Indian, and communist activists to call a May Day general strike in protest against apartheid and white minority rule. 
Mandela opposed the strike because it was multi-racial and not ANC-led, but a majority of black workers took part, resulting in increased police repression and the introduction of the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950, affecting the actions of all protest groups.[72] At the ANC national conference of December 1951, he continued arguing against a racially united front, but was outvoted.[73] 
Thenceforth, he rejected Lembede's Africanist beliefs and embraced the idea of a multi-racial front against apartheid.[74] Influenced by friends like Moses Kotane and by the Soviet Union's support for wars of independence, Mandela's mistrust of communism broke down and he began reading literature by Marxists like Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and Mao Zedong, eventually embracing the Marxist idea of dialectical materialism.[75] Commenting on communism, he later stated that he "found myself strongly drawn to the idea of a classless society which, to my mind, was similar to traditional African culture where life was shared and communal."[76] In April 1952, Mandela began work at the H.M. Basner law firm,[77] though his increasing commitment to work and activism meant he spent less time with his family.[78] 
These methods, which fit very well with the Chinese way of learning, have been criticized as fundamentally flawed by Western educationalists and linguists.[53] Furthermore, newly learned words are seldom put into use. This arises because everyone in China communicates through Mandarin and English is perceived to be of little use in the country. This is further reinforced through the national Band 4 examination where 80% of the test was the writing component, 20% was devoted to listening, and speaking was excluded entirely.

Development 
U.S. News & World Report. Asia is among the fastest growing destinations for international students, and foreign enrollment at universities in Indonesia and South Korea have more than doubled since 2005, the agency reports. 
China continues to be the most popular destination in the region, though, ranking third among countries that host the most international students, IIE reports. 1 2 3 4 5 Hornby, Lucy (Reuters). 
Education in China is a state-run system of public education run by the Ministry of Education. 
All citizens must attend school for at least nine years, known as the nine-year compulsory education, which is funded by the government. 
Compulsory education includes six years of primary education, starting at age six or seven, and three years of junior secondary education (junior middle school) for ages 12 to 15. 
Some provinces may have five years of primary school but four years for junior middle school. 
After junior middle school, there are three years of senior middle school, which then completes the secondary education. 
The Ministry of Education reported a 99 percent attendance rate for primary school and an 80 percent rate for both primary and middle schools. In 1985, the government abolished tax-funded higher education, requiring university applicants to compete for scholarships based on academic ability. 
In the early 1980s the government allowed the establishment of the first private institution of higher learning, increasing the number of undergraduates and people who hold doctoral degrees fivefold from 1995 to 2005.[4] 
In 2003, central and local governments in China supported 1,552 institutions of higher learning (colleges and universities) and their 725,000 professors and 11 million students (see List of universities in China). 
There are over 100 National Key Universities, including Peking University and Tsinghua University, which are considered to be an elite group of Chinese universities. Chinese spending has grown by 20% per year since 1999, now reaching over $100bn, and as many as 1.5 million science and engineering students graduated from Chinese universities in 2006. 
China published 184,080 papers as of 2008.[5] 
China has also become a top destination for international students.[6] As of 2013, China is the most popular country in Asia for international students, and ranks third overall among countries.[6] 
Laws regulating the system of education include the Regulation on Academic Degrees, the Compulsory Education Law, the Teachers Law, the Education Law, the Law on Vocational Education, and the Law on Higher Education.

Although Shanghai and Hong Kong are among the top performers in the Programme for International Student Assessment, China's educational system has been criticized for its rigorousness and its emphasis on test preparation. 
Since the end of the Cultural Revolution (1966–76), the education system in China has been geared toward economic modernization. In 1985, the national government ceded responsibility for basic education to local governments through the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's "Decision on the Reform of the Educational Structure." 
In unveiling the education reform plan in May 1985, the authorities called for nine years of compulsory education and the establishment of the State Education Commission (created the following month). 
Official commitment to improved education was nowhere more evident than in the substantial increase in funds for education in the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986–90), which amounted to 72 percent more than funds allotted to education in the previous plan period (1981–85). 
In 1986 some 16.8 percent of the state budget was earmarked for education, compared with 10.4 percent in 1984. Since 1949, education has been a focus of controversy in China. 
As a result of continual intraparty realignments, official policy alternated between ideological imperatives and practical efforts to further national development. 
But ideology and pragmatism often have been incompatible. 
The Great Leap Forward (1958–60) and the Socialist Education Movement (1962–65) sought to end deeply rooted academic elitism, to narrow social and cultural gaps between workers and peasants and between urban and rural populations, and to eliminate the tendency of scholars and intellectuals to disdain manual labor. 
During the Cultural Revolution, universal fostering of social equality was an overriding priority. 
A mean value theorem equation is displayed on a bridge in Beijing. 
The post-Mao Zedong Chinese Communist Party leadership viewed education as the foundation of the Four Modernizations. 
In the early 1980s, science and technology education became an important focus of education policy. 
By 1986 training skilled personnel and expanding scientific and technical knowledge had been assigned the highest priority. 
Although the humanities were considered important, vocational and technical skills were considered paramount for meeting China's modernization goals. 
The reorientation of educational priorities paralleled Deng Xiaoping's strategy for economic development. 
Emphasis also was placed on the further training of the already-educated elite, who would carry on the modernization program in the coming decades. 
Renewed emphasis on modern science and technology led to the adoption, beginning in 1976, of an outward-looking policy that encouraged learning and borrowing from abroad for advanced training in a wide range of scientific fields. 
Beginning at the Third Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee in December 1978, intellectuals were encouraged to pursue research in support of the Four Modernizations and, as long as they complied with the party's "Four Cardinal Principles" they were given relatively free rein. 
But when the party and the government determined that the strictures of the four cardinal principles had been stretched beyond tolerable limits, they did not hesitate to restrict intellectual expression. 
Literature and the arts also experienced a great revival in the late 1970s and 1980s. 
Traditional forms flourished once again, and many new kinds of literature and cultural expression were introduced from abroad. 
As of 2015 the government-operated primary and lower secondary (junior high) schools in China have 28.8 million students.[7]

Letta Mbulu (born 23 August 1942) is a South African jazz singer who has been active since the 1960s. 
In early 2006, Blum briefly became the subject of widespread media attention when Osama bin Laden issued a public statement in which he quoted Blum and recommended that all Americans read Rogue State: A Guide to the World's Only Superpower. 
As a result of the mention, sales of his book greatly increased.[1] "I was quite surprised and even shocked and amused when I found out what he'd said," Blum commented. 
"I was glad. 
I knew it would help the book's sales and I was not bothered by who it was coming from. 
If he shares with me a deep dislike for certain aspects of US foreign policy, then I'm not going to spurn any endorsement of the book by him. 
I think it's good that he shares those views and I'm not turned off by that."[7] On the Bin Laden endorsement, Blum stated, "This is almost as good as being an Oprah book."[3] In an interview on MSNBC Countdown, he said: "Basically it's US foreign policy which creates anti-American terrorists. 
It's the things we do to the world. It's not, as the White House tells us, that they hate our freedom and democracy. 
That's just propaganda."[8] 
In a May 22, 2006 article entitled, "Come Out of the White House With Your Hands Up", Blum wrote, "Since the bin Laden recommendation, 19 January, I have not been offered a single speaking engagement on any campus. . . . 
This despite January–May normally being the most active period for me and other campus speakers." 
Death 
Blum died on December 9, 2018 in Arlington, Virginia from kidney failure at the age of 85 after being injured in a fall in his apartment two months earlier.[1]

In his books and online columns, Blum devoted substantial attention to CIA interventions and assassination plots. 
Noam Chomsky has called Blum's book on the CIA, "far and away the best book on the topic."[5] Blum supported Ralph Nader's presidential campaigns.[6] He circulated a monthly newsletter by email called "The Anti-Empire Report". 
Blum described his life's mission as: "If not ending, at least slowing down the American Empire. At least injuring the beast. It's causing so much suffering around the world."[3]

On 4 November 1996, former Vlakplaas commander, Dirk Coetzee, testified about his involvement in the murder of Griffiths Mxenge. 
He also asked for amnesty from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. 
Despite protests from Mxenge's family, Coetzee was granted amnesty.[6] 
Legacy 
Mxenge and his wife were both awarded the Order of Luthuli in Silver by the South African government. 
His award recognised his contribution to the field of law and the supreme sacrifice he made in the fight against apartheid in South Africa [7]

Robert McBride (born 6 July 1963) is the former chief of the metropolitan police for Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality. 
During the apartheid era he was a member of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the African National Congress, and was convicted of terrorism after he bombed a busy night club, in an attack that killed three people. 
In February 2014 McBride was appointed as Executive Director of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate.[1] In March 2015 he was suspended from this position by the Minister of Police. 
The decision was set aside by the Constitutional Court of South Africa in September 2016.[2] 
Biography 
McBride was born in Addington Hospital and grew up in Wentworth, a racially segregated suburb about 11 km from Durban, where his parents were schoolteachers. 
He attended Fairvale High School in Wentworth and participated in extramural activities like rugby, karate, boxing, chess, hockey and soccer. 
After he was beaten by an older boy in the neighbourhood, his father taught him martial arts.[1] 
He developed political views at an early age due to influence of his father. 
He was particularly influenced by two books: A.J. Venter's Coloured: A Profile of 2 Million South Africans, which describes the efforts of coloured political activists such as James April, Don Mattera, Jakes Gerwel, Basil February, and his uncle, Rev. Clive McBride; and Soledad Brothers: The Prison Letters of George Jackson, written by a founding member of the American Black Guerrilla Family.[1] 
McBride was best known for his leadership of the cell that bombed the "Why Not" Restaurant and Magoo's Bar in Durban on 14 June 1986, an attack in which three white women were killed and 69 people injured. 
He was captured and convicted for the Durban bombing, and sentenced to death, but later reprieved while on death row. 
In 1992, he was released after his actions were classified as politically motivated. 
He was later granted amnesty at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which provided for amnesty in return for complete disclosure of acts of politically motivated violence after the ANC changed its early denials of involvement to a claim that they ordered the bombing.[1] The South African government, at the time[when?], had portrayed the attack as being targeted at innocent civilians. 
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa) report stated, "It seems that not many, if any, of the victims in this incident were members of the South African Police. 
Furthermore, the criticisms directed at the quality of reconnaissance of the "Why Not Bar" might very well be valid. 
It may be, as was argued, that he ought to have ensured at the relevant time that the primary targets of the attack were present and therefore the concept of the proportionality of the attack and its results must be considered."[5] McBride and others were granted amnesty for the attack, although the commission did find the bombing to be a "gross violation of human rights",[2] as well for other offences including those arising from the escape of Gordon Webster. 
In 2006, McBride received the Merit Medal in Silver and the Conspicuous Leadership Star from the South African National Defence Force for his service and combat leadership in Umkhonto We Sizwe.[citation needed]

He served in the government of South Africa as Minister in the Presidency from 2014 to 2018. 
Previously he was Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development from 2009 to 2014. 
Radebe is South Africa's longest continuously serving cabinet member, having been part of every national administration since 1994 and under every post-apartheid President. 
Education and personal 
Radebe was born in Cato Manor, and lived there until 1958 when his family was forcibly removed to KwaMashu.[1] He is married to Bridgette Radebe, South Africa's first black female mining entrepreneur and sister of the billionaire mining magnate, Patrice Motsepe. 
He studied towards a law degree at the University of Zululand, and finished an LLM in International Law at the Karl Marx University in Leipzig in 1981.[2] 
Radebe joined the African National Congress (ANC) in 1976, while he was a student. 
In 1977 the ANC sent Radebe to Mozambique, and soon after to Tanzania where he worked as a journalist for a radio station in Dar es Salaam. 
After an unsuccessful secret mission by the ANC, Radebe was arrested in 1986, and was convicted under the Terrorism Act of the then Apartheid government. 
He was sentenced to a 10-year imprisonment on Robben Island. 
After a successful 12-day hunger strike, Radebe was released from prison in 1990. 
After the 1994 democratic elections, Radebe served as Minister of Public Works under Nelson Mandela. 
Under the leadership of Thabo Mbeki, Radebe served as Minister of Public Enterprises (1999–2004) and Minister of Transport[3] (2004–2009). 
On 26 February 2007, Radebe was appointed acting Minister of Health due to the ongoing ill health of Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang.[4] 
Media appearances 
Legacy 
On 8 June 1976, the South African Police attempted to arrest Enos Ngutshane at Naledi High School. 
He was the local leader of the South African Students Movement.[4] He had sent a letter to the government about the imposition of Afrikaans as the language to be used in schools. 
The police failed to apprehend him, and the police were stoned and a Volkswagen Beetle was set on fire by the students.[5] 
The school achieved a pass rate of 8% but they were able to increase that to 61% in 2000.[3] 
After the photograph was released, he was harassed by the security services, and was forced to flee South Africa. 
His mother, Nombulelo Makhubu, told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that she received a letter from him from Nigeria in 1978, but that she had not heard from him since.[2] She died in 2004, seemingly without knowledge of what had happened to her son.[3] Mbuyisa was one of a number of South African activists given refuge in Nigeria immediately following the Soweto incident. 
He was one of three who were settled in a boarding high school in South-Western Nigeria - Federal Government College, Warri during the 1976/77 academic year. 
But all failed to settle, and had moved on within the year.[4] 
Early activism 
Zwelakhe Sisulu walked a fine line between journalism and activism already while at The Rand Daily Mail. 
In 1977, he became president of the Writers' Association of South Africa. 
As president, he led a march with his fellow black journalists and then was briefly jailed. 
Sisulu's editor admonished him for his explanation that he was making use of his freedom of assembly. 
His editor told him, "You don't march, you write."[6] 
Sisulu first came to international attention in a case involving the surveillance of black journalists. 
While an editor at the Sunday Post in 1979, Sisulu was questioned by authorities about his knowledge of a source used by journalist Thamsanqa Gerald Mkhwanazi. 
Sisulu was sentenced for nine months in prison for refusing to co-operate. 
For the first time, police acknowledged in his case the practice of using wiretaps on a journalists' telephones, which had been widely suspected.[13] 
Strike and arrest 
Zwelakhe Sisulu was the leader of the union during Mwasa's strike for fair wages for black journalists in 1980. 
It was the first strike by black journalists.[1] After the strike was over, he lost his job, was banned from journalism, and ordered under house arrest for three years until 1983. 
Zwelakhe Sisulu's arrest on 30 June 1981 was attributed to the Internal Security Act. 
Other leaders who shared the same fate were Phil Mtimkhulu, Mathatha Tsedu, Subri Govende and Joe Thloloe.[2] 
He was a Nieman Fellow from 1984–1985.[1] 
New Nation and 1986 arrests 
Police swept him away from his home for the first time on 27 June 1986. 
Sisulu later called them "armed bandits." 
The government announced his detention one week later. 
There were calls from abroad to release him, such as one from the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE). 
He was released on 18 July 1986.[14][15][16][17] 
Zwelakhe Sisulu had already been appointed director of the Board for a new organisation ARTICLE 19 at the time of his second arrest 12 December 1986. 
He was detained at John Vorster Square where other activists were also imprisoned.[1] The organization made his case its first campaign. 
He was released after two years but not allowed to continue his work as a journalist.[2][10][18] Years later, he stated his belief that the publicity of organisations like ARTICLE 19 during the time of his imprisonment saved his life.[5] 
Zwelakhe Sisulu (17 December 1950 – 4 October 2012)[1] was a South African black journalist, editor, and newspaper founder. 
He was president of the Writers' Association of South Africa, which later became the Black Media Workers Association of South Africa (or Mwasa), and he led a year-long strike in 1980 for fair wages for black journalists. 
He was a victim of the Apartheid-era government in South Africa and was imprisoned at least three times for his journalism.[3][4][5] After Apartheid ended, he became the chief executive officer of the South African Broadcast Corporation.[5] 
South African Broadcasting Corporation 
He was the CEO of the South African Broadcasting Corporation from September 1994 to 1997.[1] Under Sisulu's leadership in a democratic South Africa, the SABC was reorganized and relaunched 4 February 1996. 
A controversy was created over the redistribution of resources for other languages besides Afrikaans, which had received special privileges under the Apartheid system.[19] 
Later, Sisulu was appointed as a commissioner to investigate censorship at the SABC that had been alleged by whistleblower John Perlman.[20] 
Sisulu was awarded an Order of Mapungubwe - Gold, posthumously for "his exceptional contribution to quality journalism; and as a reporter exposing the cruelties of apartheid and encouraging unity among the people of different political persuasions to fight for liberation.")[21]

Personal history 
Zwelakhe Sisulu's family is well known for its struggle against Apartheid in South Africa.[7] He was the son of anti-Apartheid activists and African National Congress members Walter Sisulu and Albertina Sisulu. 
He was the brother of Max Sisulu, Speaker of the National Assembly, and Lindiwe Sisulu, Minister of Public Service and Administration. 
His father was sentenced to life in prison in 1964 when Zwelakhe Sisulu was 13 years old.[1] 
Career 
Zwelakhe Sisulu began his career in journalism in 1975 when he worked as an intern for South African Associated Newspapers. 
He then became a journalist for The Rand Daily Mail where he covered the Soweto uprising in 1976 and remained there until 1978. 
He was news editor of the Sunday Post (South Africa) until his ban in 1980.[1][2] While at the Sunday Post, he was sentenced to prison for his refusal to reveal information about sources of one of his reporters and he led a 1980 strike which resulted in his ban from journalism for several years. 
After his house arrest, he was a Nieman Fellow. 
After his fellowship was complete in 1985, he worked for Sowetan. 
In 1986, he founded the New Nation (defunct since 30 May 1997),[9] before he was arrested by police and held without a trial as part of the emergency and mass arrests in South Africa at the time. 
The newspaper was editorially aligned with the African National Congress, which stated on its masthead: "The media of the powerless." 
At the time it was South Africa's largest black newspaper.[4] After his release from a 2-year detention and after the ban was lifted on the ANC, Sisulu served as Nelson Mandela's press secretary and also the director of information of the African National Congress.[5][11] 
In post-Apartheid South Africa, Sisulu became the head of the South African Broadcast Corporation in 1994.[1] 
After his stint at SABC, Sisulu founded New African Investments Limited, which is known as the first black-owned business on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and black empowerment.[12] Holdings of the company include the publishing house David Philip, Soweto TV and Primedia Broadcasting.[2]

The International Year of Indigenous Languages is a United Nations observance in 2019 that aims to raise awareness of the consequences of the endangerment of Indigenous languages across the world, with an aim to establish a link between language, development, peace, and reconciliation.[1][2][3][4][5][6] 
On 19 December 2016 the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed 2019 as the International Year of Indigenous Languages based on a resolution of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (Resolution 71/178).[1][7][3] The General Assembly resolution requested the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as the lead UN agency for coordination of the year.[4][5][6][8] 
The International Year of Indigenous Languages aims to focus attention on the risks confronting indigenous languages, especially those significant for development, reconciliation, good governance and peace building. 
It aims to improve quality of life, wider international cooperation and visibility and strengthened intercultural dialogue to reaffirm the continuity of indigenous languages and cultures.[1][2][9] 
The year plans to carry out activities which will take form in the following three thematic areas, encompassing both the 2010 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. 
Involvement in the year is available to indigenous peoples, UN system organisations, countries, academia, public and private bodies and the media.[1][2][3][6]

Frene Ginwala Freedom Collection interview 
Frene Noshir Ginwala (born 25 April 1932)[1] is a South African journalist and politician who was the Speaker of the National Assembly of South Africa from 1994 to 2004.[2] Ginwala is an Indian South African from the Parsi-Indian community of western India. 
She studied for a DPhil at Linacre College, Oxford. 
Ginwala was appointed as the first chancellor of the University of KwaZulu-Natal in April 2005. 
She is one of only four female University Chancellors in South Africa.[3] 
Biography 
Ginwala has written a number of books dealing with various aspects of the struggle against injustice. 
For her efforts, she has been honoured by international and local institutions and governments. 
Using her anonymity, she played a tremendous role in establishing underground escape routes for ANC leaders and cadres in the period following the Sharpeville massacre and the declaration of the State of Emergency (SOE) in 1960. 
These included Deputy-President of the ANC Oliver Tambo and Yusuf Dadoo, two leaders of the liberation movement. 
She also organised safe houses for those who had to remain in the country. 
Ginwala also chauffeured NIC (Natal Indian Congress) leaders Monty Naicker and J. N. Singh, who were operating from the underground after managing to dodge the police swoop. 
Their instructions were to travel around the province and raise money from secret donors in order to support the families left destitute through the arrest of their breadwinners under the SOE which hung over the country for five months. 
Eventually she had to leave South Africa in the latter part of 1960 and together with Tambo, and Dadoo, they established an exile ANC office in Dar es Salaam, Tanganyika which was still under British Colonial Administration until 9 December 1961. 
The overthrow of the regime in Zanzibar in 1963 paved the way for the formation of the United Republic of Tanzania in 1964. 
Apart from the ANC, she threw herself in a very broad field of activities. 
She gave lectures to trainees diplomats at Oxford University, she studied, she wrote for a number of the established media in the UK and elsewhere including the BBC. 
Frene Ginwala was very instrumental in establishing a communications system in the newly born Republic of Tanzania and Zanzibar. 
At the request of President Julius Nyerere, she became the managing editor of the English-speaking daily newspaper Standard, and Sunday News. 
During the entire period of her exile (she returned to South Africa in 1991) she traversed the world preaching the horrors of apartheid and the fight against it. 
Ginwala holds academic titles from several universities in Africa and abroad. 
She is a barrister at law; historian; a political scientist, and holds a doctorate in philosophy from Oxford University. 
In the first democratic national elections of 1994 in South Africa, Frene Ginwala was elected to Parliament. 
She was nominated by the ANC caucus and elected by parliament as the first woman to the position of Speaker of the House. 
A position she held from 1994 until 2004. 
After retirement as speaker, she continued serving in a number of international organisations including UN subsidiaries, as Trustee of the Nelson Mandela Foundation and as Chancellor of the University of KwaZulu Natal. 
Corruption in South Africa includes the private use of public resources, bribery, and improper favoritism.[1] The 2017 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index assigned South Africa an index of 43 out of 100, ranking South Africa 71 out of 180 countries.[2] This ranking represents a downward direction change with a drop of two points down from 45 (2016 CPI).[3] Countries with scores below 50 are believed to have a serious corruption problems.[4] Recent scandals surfacing since 2016 involving former South African President Jacob Zuma have drawn attention to corruption in South Africa. 
Cyril Ramaphosa, the newly elected South African President, has vowed to root out existing corruption and further the development of anti-corruption initiatives.[5] 
South Africa has a robust anti-corruption framework, but laws are inadequately enforced and accountability in public sectors such as healthcare remain low.[6] In addition, negative sanctions have been put in place to discourage whistle blowers from reporting corrupt activities in both the public and private sectors. 
A recent scandal involving the Gupta family and former South African President Jacob Zuma, has pushed Zuma out of office while resurfacing a long list corruption complaints against the former president.[7] Complaints against Zuma range from the former leader's lavish spending of state funds to the delegation of contracts to businesses with familial connections or close ties.[8] 
Although South Africa is subject to various types of corruption, two prevalent forms are tenderpreneurism and BEE fronting. 
Recent scandals involving South African politicians and the Gupta family have brought both types of corruption into the public spotlight. 
Petty Corruption is another relevant issue affecting public services and day-to-day life in South Africa. 
Tenderpreneurism 
A tenderpreneur is an individual who enriches themselves through corrupting the awarding of government tender contracts, mostly based on personal connections and corrupt relationships - although outright bribery might also take place - and sometimes involving an elected or politically appointed official (or his or her family members) holding simultaneous business interests.[20] This is often accompanied by overcharging and shoddy workmanship. 
The previous case involving the Gupta family and their close ties to the Zuma regime can be classified as tenderpreneurism. 
BEE-fronting is an abuse of the rules governing Black Economic Empowerment (BEE), where qualifying persons are given a seat on the Board of Directors of a company while having no decision-making power in the company, in order to qualify the company for government contracts in terms of BEE.[21] In June 2017, Netcare, a company which operates the largest private hospital network in South Africa, was accused of BEE fronting.[22] Since then, 17 other complaints have been filed against various South African companies regarding BEE-fronting.[23] Related to this is Cadre deployment and employment, which is an official ANC policy.[24] 
Petty Corruption 
Petty corruption is a prevalent issue in South Africa's public service sphere. 
A survey conducted by the ISS National Victims of Crime tested the extent and nature of petty corruption in South Africa.[25] One of the main issues highlighted by this survey is South Africans lack of information regarding how to report corrupt acts.[26] The fear of facing repercussions for whistleblowing and the pervasive belief that reporting corruption will not cause change are two other concerns revealed by the 2011 survey.[27] Respondents of the survey were most likely to pay bribes to traffic officials, followed by police officers and officials in employment offices.[28] These findings support the notion that the perception of corruption in local government departments such as traffic and municipal policing is high.[29] The frequency of bribes involving police officers is concerning due to their role in tackling corruption and illicit behavior. 
Only 5.6% of South Africans reported experiencing forms of petty corruption involving either money, favors, and gifts.[30] Even though the percentage of experienced corruption is low, the high perception of corruption has led respondents to prioritize corruption as the second most prevalent crime in the country.[31] 
Corruption Scandals 
President Zuma and Corruption 
In 2018, South Africa's highest court found Mr. Zuma guilty of violating the constitution in regard to lavish spending of 246 million Rand of state funds towards Zuma's homestead in Nkandla.[32] After a home invasion and the subsequent rape of one of Zuma's four wives, Zuma undertook the means to upgrade security measures.[33] A report by South Africa's public protector in 2014 found Zuma had inappropriately allocated state funds to finance additional home improvements such as the addition of a swimming pool, amphitheater, visitor center, and cattle enclosure to his property.[34] Zuma's time in office has been marked by controversy and outside accusations of corruption. 
Zuma's close relationship with the Gupta family has been highlighted in the former South African Public Protector's report on state capture.[35] Zuma's resignation on February 14 comes after months of pressure from the ANC.[36] 
Perception of Corruption in South Africa 
In a recent turn of events, Former President Jacob Zuma will be prosecuted on 12 counts of fraud, one of racketeering, two of corruption and one of money laundering. 
Zuma will face corruption charges involving the 2.5 billion dollar South African Arms Deal.[37] 
Gupta Family Scandal 
In 2016, the Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela, investigated the Gupta Family Scandal after receiving a formal complaint from a Catholic priest, called Father Stanslaus Muyebe. 
The State of Capture report released by the Public Protector in 2016 reports on the dangers of state capture in the case of South Africa.[38] The 355 page document reports Mr. Zuma's preferential treatment of the Gupta family and the involvement of Jacob Zuma's son and the Gupta family.[39] The allegations reported on include the Gupta Family's involvement in the appointments and removals of members of the South African cabinet, the unlawful awarding of state contracts to Gupta linked companies or persons, the banks’ preferential treatment of Gupta owned companies, and Zuma's conflict of interest concerning his position and business dealings.[40] The Gupta brothers, who have been major players in South African business for over a decade, began growing their relationship with former President Jacob Zuma in 2003 as he occupied the office of deputy president. 
Since 2003, both parties have benefited from an understanding in which the Gupta family financed the Zuma family while President Zuma appointed friendly officials and awarded lucrative state contracts to the Gupta empire.[41] South African authorities are seeking to recover up to US$4.07 billion lost to Gupta's deals.[42] Jacob Zuma's son, Duduzane, and Gloria Ngeme Zuma, one of Mr. Zuma's wives, received large transfers and monthly salaries for positions held at one of the Gupta firms. 
The Gupta family has engaged in a wealth of suspicious transactions with a series of shell companies and state-owned enterprises.[43] The OCCRP has reported on Transnet's contract with South China rail and subcontracts with Gupta run organizations. 
State controlled companies like Eskom and Transnet were in the center of illicit deals with Gupta companies.[44] Eskom, the state electricity provider, has deposited over R1.8 billion into various Gupta accounts. 
Eskom paid Trillion, a Gupta-controlled enterprise, over R466 million for managerial help at a time when Trillion had a few employees. 
Other companies sub-contracted by Eskom reveal dealings with Tegeta, another Gupta-run company. 
Eskom spent double the average amount purchasing coal from Tegeta, becoming the most expensive supply contract in Eskom history. 
An arrest warrant for Ajay Gupta has been issued in February 2018.[45] The Gupta family mansion was raided in the same month, leaving all three brothers on the run. 
Bank of Baroda Scandal 
The Bank of Baroda, an Indian state-owned bank, has played a crucial role in the Gupta family's business deals.[46] According to a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), the Bank of Baroda allowed the Gupta family to move millions of dollars in alleged corrupt business transactions to offshore accounts.[47] Although the Bank of Baroda denies the illicit behavior, the documents report that the bank's South African branch issued unapproved loan guarantees, ignored internal compliance efforts, and averted regulators from learning about suspicious transactions in a way that benefited the Guptas’ network.[48] Around 4.5m Rand have circulated around a handful of Gupta-associated companies between 2007 and 2017.[49] Due to the volume of Gupta owned accounts, the majority of the bank's transactions in Johannesburg involved Gupta family funds.[50] 
Reports reveal that inter-company loans provided an untraceable and inexplicable technique used by the Gupta brothers to transfer money from the Bank to various Gupta-owned companies like Trillion Financial Advisory and Centaur Mining. 
The suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed by workers at the Bank of Baroda related to Gupta transactions were often voided by managers and higher-level bank officials.[51] Most SARs failed to reach the South African Financial Intelligence Centre as a result. 
The Arms Deal Scandal 
The arms deal, formally known as the Strategic Defence Package, was a multi-billion dollar deal involving arms acquisitions from countries such as Germany and France.[52] This arms deal set a precedent for cases of large-scale corruption and high levels of bribery and embezzlement in the African National Congress. 
This arms deal came at a time when the AIDS epidemic was rampant throughout Africa and poverty and inequality in the region still remained among the highest in the world. 
Taxpayers protested the arms deal through a public interest lawsuit claiming that the deal was unconstitutional and irrational.[53] Various South African and international evidence teams have been investigating the arms deal since the early 2000s.[54] Rumors of embezzlement, bribes, and kick-backs sent the way of the ANC, have also prompted further investigations. 
In 2011, Former President Zuma organized a commission of enquiry headed by Judge Seriti.[55] The Seriti Commission is currently playing a part in the ongoing investigation of allegations of impropriety, fraud, and corruption around the 1998 Arms Deal.[56] 
In 2013, the Afrobarometer report shows a substantial increase in the public perception of corruption since 2008.[9] While a little over half of all people on the continent of Africa (56%) believe that their country could be doing more to curb corruption, 66% of South Africans believe that the government could be taking more steps to restrict corrupt activity.[10] South Africa ranks among the lowest countries where citizens have experienced corruption on a first-hand basis. 
Only 15% of South Africans admit to having paid a bribe in the past year. 
The average percentage of Africans paying bribes in the prior year falls around 30%.[11] 
As of March 2018, Jacob Zuma was on trial facing 16 charges of corruption, racketeering, and fraud involving the 1998 Arms Deal.[57] In total Zuma has been accused of accepting 783 illegal payments, including receiving bribes from a French Arms firm via his financial advisor.[58] In April 2018, two months after resigning from office, Zuma has been charged with graft by a national jury.[59] 
Anti-Corruption Initiatives 
Government initiatives against corruption are coordinated by the Department of Public Service and Administration.[60] The Public Protector also plays a role in fighting corruption. 
A disbanded independent anti-corruption unit named the Scorpions was replaced by the Hawks.[61] The Hawks are South Africa's Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) designed to target organized crime, economic crime, and corruption.[62] The group was established by the Zuma administration in 2008.[63] South Africa has well-developed framework and legislation outlining corruption initiatives. The Prevention and Combating of Corruption Act (PCCA) criminalizes corruption in public and private sectors and codifies specific offences, making it easier for courts to use the legislation.[64] This act especially condemns bribery, extortion, abuse of power, and money laundering while obliging public officials to report corruption offences.[65] Like many corruption regulation in South Africa, the PCCA is poorly implemented and the act does not include any protectionary measures for whistleblowers.[66] 
The National Anti-Corruption Forum provides an online guide to the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Act (PCCA).[67] Other acts like the Promotion of Access to Information Act calls for an increased access to public information.[68] The Public Finance Management Act examines government expenditures and the Code of Conduct for Assembly and Permanent Council members calls for the full disclosure of members to report gifts.[69] Enforcement mechanisms remain weak for many of these preventative acts, allowing for corrupt actions to go unreported. 
South Africa has ratified the United Nations Convention against Corruption, the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption and the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.[70] 
In 2018 the Zondo Commission of Inquiry was setup to investigate allegations of state capture and corruption during the administration of President Jacob Zuma. 
Testimony given during the inquiry implicated Bosasa,[71] the Gupta family, associates of former president Zuma.[72] During the inquiry hearings a joint memorandum signed by the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland representing countries that make up 75% of foreign direct investment into South Africa warned that if unaddressed corruption would have a negative impact on future investment in South Africa. 
It called for President Ramaphosa at act against perpetrators of corruption.[73] The South African government responded that it was disappointed by the memorandum not following "acceptable" diplomatic practices.[74] 
Past Notable Incidents of Corruption 
Tony Yengeni, the ANC's chief parliamentary whip, was found guilty of fraud in 2005 after Yengeni received a large discount on a luxury car from a firm bidding for a government contract.[75] Former President Jacob Zuma's financial advisor, Schabir Shaik, was sentenced to 15 years in 2005 for soliciting a bribe from a French arms company named Thales. 
The bribe was solicited on the behalf of President Zuma.[76] In 2005, the Travelgate scandal exposed forty Members of Parliament who were found to have illegally used parliamentary travel vouchers worth R18,000,000 for personal use.[77] Former South African President Thabo Mbeki and Sepp Blatter agreed to a $10m deal in 2007, which US prosecutors say was a "bribe" to secure the 2010 World Cup.[78] The Goodwood police station commander, Siphiwu Hewana, was found guilty of attempting to defeat the ends of justice by tampering with the docket for convicted fraudster Tony Yengeni's arrest for driving under the influence in 2007.[79] Former National Police Commissioner and ex-President of Interpol, Jackie Selebi, was charged with graft in July 2010, for receiving (at least) R120,000 from alleged crime-syndicate boss, Glenn Agliotti.[80] The collapse of the VBS Mutual Bank in 2018 due to fraud and corruption created a scandal that implicated municipalities,[81] the ANC,[82] and the Economic Freedom Fighters.[83]

Between 2011 and 2015, approval of Former President Zuma was halved to 36% due to reports of corruption and inadequate leadership.[12] The majority of South Africans believe that different branches of government should oversee other branches' work. 
Around a quarter of South Africans feel as if they should be responsible for holding elected representatives and leaders accountable.[13] 
Apartheid and Corruption 
Apartheid, the system of discrimination and segregation on racial grounds, dominated the ideology and political system in South Africa from 1948 to 1994. 
This system, which intentionally excluded non-Afrikaners from civil service jobs, government positions, and politics altogether, came to an end in 1994 when the African National Congress headed by Nelson Mandela conducted negotiations with the South African government at the time.[14] Before the abolition of Apartheid, civil service was a pervasive medium for rent-seeking and the preferential treatment of Afrikaners.[15] Policies favoring Afrikaner cultural and educational systems, the awarding of government contracts to Afrikaner businesses, and the funding of parastatal Afrikaner organizations was a common phenomenon during the era of Apartheid. 
The building of rural homeland states in the 1980s created ideal projects for rent-seeking with many homeland leaders presiding over massive patronage networks.[16] 
Around the same time, the ANC was receiving funds from foreign donors in order to build up stronger opposition parties to protest the South Africa's National Party and Apartheid. 
These leaders were given large sums of money without formal book-keeping. 
Even though there is no evidence of corruption or rent-seeking, the informal habits and the notion of ANC leaders being above accounting remained with the party which rose to power after the transition.[17] The ANC's tradition of loyalty to the organization was shaped in the Apartheid era, with clear implications in modern-day ANC politics. 
In the years leading up to the inevitable transition of power, corruption was rampant in most government departments, intelligence agencies, the police, and the military. 
There is much ongoing debate regarding the origin of corruption and the definition of corruption in South Africa. 
The inherited bureaucracy and political culture originating in the Apartheid era renders corruption issues hard to trace and tackle.[18] The creation of a new economic elite consisting of ANC members or associates following 1994, created a context where corruption flourished under the new regime.[19] Both the new and old political order created their own types of corruption, benefitting those in their inner circles. 
Although forms of endemic corruption were passed on to the new order, since 1994, new forms of corruption have persisted and layered themselves on top.

Zenda discovered his ability to paint at an early age. 
Christiaan Frederick Beyers Naudé (10 May 1915 – 7 September 2004) was a South African cleric, theologian and the leading Afrikaner anti-apartheid activist.[1] He was known simply as Beyers Naudé, or more colloquially, Oom Bey (Afrikaans for "Uncle Bey"). 
Early life and education 
One of eight children, Beyers Naudé was born to Jozua François Naudé and Adriana Johanna Naudé (née) van Huyssteen in Roodepoort, Transvaal (now Gauteng). 
The progenitor of the Naudé name was a French Huguenot refugee named Jacques Naudé who arrived in the Cape in 1718.[2] The Naudé surname is one of numerous French surnames that retained their original spelling in South Africa. 
Beyers Naudé was named for General Christiaan Frederick Beyers, under whom his father had served as a soldier and unofficial pastor during the second Anglo-Boer War.[3]

Their “#GuptaLeaks” investigations have produced many stories over the years that exposed substantive political corruption in the South African government, recognized by several prestigious awards for investigative journalism. 
These reports suggested that the Gupta family had ”captured the state” through their friendship with then-President Zuma and seem to have contributed to 2016 electoral defeats by the ANC in South Africa's largest cities, the defeat of Zuma as president of the African National Congress on 18 December 2017 and then to Zuma's resignation as head of state on 14 February 2018.[3] They've also contributed to the Paradise Papers exposé[4] and many other reports relating to the South African political economy. 
The following include only a few of the awards presented to amaBhungane and members of their team: 
19 March 2018: “19 journalists from AmaBhungane, the Daily Maverick and News24, won the 2017 Taco Kuiper Award for their excellent investigative journalism into the Gupta email leaks, also known as the #GuptaLeaks.”[5] Taco Kuiper is reportedly South Africa's biggest investigative journalism award. 
16 November 2017: AmaBhungane shared the 2017 Vodacom Journalist of the Year Award in the financial / economic category with the Daily Maverick and News24 for the #GuptaLeaks series.[6]

The Honourable Edwin Cameron Justice of the Constitutional Court of South Africa In office 1 January 2009 – 20 August 2019 Appointed by President Kgalema Motlanthe Judge of the Supreme Court of Appeal In office July 2000 – 31 December 2008 Appointed by President Thabo Mbeki Acting Judge of the Constitutional Court of South Africa In office August 1999 – May 2000 Judge of the Witwatersrand Local Division In office 1 January 1995 – July 2000 Appointed by President Nelson Mandela Personal details Born (1953-02-15) 15 February 1953 (age 66) Pretoria, South Africa Alma mater Stellenbosch University Keble College, Oxford University of South Africa 
In October 1994, President Nelson Mandela appointed Cameron as an acting judge of the High Court to chair a commission of inquiry into illegal arms sales by Armscor, operating as the sales arm of the SANDF, to Yemen.[11] Cameron's report was described as a "hard-hitting" critique of Armscor's conduct, but was quickly eclipsed by myriad other allegations about the South African government's illegal arms trades.[12] 
Cameron was appointed permanently to the Witwatersrand Local Division in 1995. 
His best-known judgment in this capacity is Holomisa v Argus Newspapers Ltd,[13] where Bantu Holomisa had brought a defamation suit against The Star for alleging that he had been "directly involved" in the infiltration into South Africa of an Azanian People's Liberation Army "hit squad" aimed at "killing whites". 
Cameron's judgment was described as a "most rigorous exposition" of the Constitution's application to private disputes and a "landmark" defence of free speech.[14] Others, while acknowledging the judgment had departed importantly from apartheid-era law, said it should have gone further in protecting journalists.[15] Cameron's position was substantially confirmed, in subsequent cases, by the Supreme Court of Appeal.[16] 
Supreme Court of Appeal 
In 1999, Cameron was given an acting stint on the Constitutional Court, during which he partook in its seminal judgments in Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Grootboom and wrote the Liquor Bill judgment on provincial legislative powers[17] — the first, and still the only, case to be referred to the Court by the President of South Africa under section 79 of the Constitution.[18] The Judicial Service Commission had recommended that Cameron be permanently appointed, but Sandile Ngcobo was ultimately preferred due to the late intercession of Thabo Mbeki, then Deputy President, who felt the appointee should be black.[19][20] Cameron has said there is "no doubt" this was the correct decision.[21] 
Cameron was instead appointed to the Supreme Court of Appeal (at the same time as Mahomed Navsa and Robert Nugent),[1] which he served for eight years. 
There he wrote leading judgments on legal causation,[22] hearsay evidence,[23] public contracts[24] and contempt of court.[25] In Minister of Finance v Gore, Cameron co-authored a judgment with Fritz Brand that held the state could be delictually liable for causing pure economic loss by fraud.[26] 
Constitutional Court 
On 31 December 2008 President Kgalema Motlanthe appointed Cameron to the Constitutional Court, taking effect from 1 January 2009. 
He is considered a crucial member of the Court's progressive wing.[27] He has been described as a "jurist of the highest order",[27] "the greatest legal mind of his generation"[2] and "in a league of his own".[28] 
The courtroom of the Constitutional Court of South Africa 
Cameron's judgment in Glenister v President, co-authored with Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke, struck down amendments to the National Prosecuting Act and South African Police Service Act on the basis that they failed to create an "adequately independent" anti-corruption unit.[29] This was praised as an "imaginative"[30] and "brilliant"[31] judgment by commentators and means South Africa must have an independent corruption-fighting agency notwithstanding the ruling ANC's controversial disbanding of the Scorpions. 
Also well-known are Cameron's judgments on defamation law and free speech: 
Edwin Cameron (born 15 February 1953 in Pretoria) was a judge on the Constitutional Court of South Africa.[1] He is well known for his HIV/AIDS and gay-rights activism and was hailed by Nelson Mandela as "one of South Africa's new heroes".[2] 
In The Citizen v McBride, Cameron's majority judgment enlarged the scope of the fair comment defence and substantially excused The Citizen from liability to Robert McBride for calling him a "murderer" unsuited for public office.[32] Le Roux v Dey, handed down in 2012, concerned three schoolboys who had superimposed an image of their deputy principal's face on the naked body of one man masturbating alongside another. 
The Constitutional Court's majority judgment held the image was defamatory of the deputy principal.[33] Cameron, however, in a judgment co-authored with Justice Froneman, dissented on this point, saying it could not be actionable to imply someone is gay. 
Leading commentators praised this conclusion.[34] Others, however, criticised Cameron's "schizophrenic" judgment for holding that the picture had nevertheless actionably harmed the plaintiff's dignity by suggesting he engaged in "sexually promiscuous or exhibitionist" conduct.[35] In Democratic Alliance v African National Congress, handed down in 2015, Cameron's majority judgment, co-authored with Justices Froneman and Khampepe, dismissed the ruling ANC's claim against the opposition Democratic Alliance for stating in a bulk SMS that Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's report shows how President Zuma "stole" taxpayers' money to build his Nkandla home.[36] The judgment was "hailed as a victory for freedom of expression during election campaigns",[37] though some thought it risked conceptual muddiness.[38] 
Cameron retired on 20 August 2019, the 25th anniversary of his appointment to the bench.[39][40]

Cameron at the first pride parade in South Africa 
Cameron has been openly gay since the early 1980s.[1] He addressed the crowd in the first pride parade in South Africa held in Johannesburg on 13 October 1990.[41][42] Thereafter he oversaw the gay and lesbian movement's submissions to the drafters of the South African Constitution and was instrumental in securing the inclusion of an express prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.[4] He is one of 29 signatories to the Yogyakarta Principles.[43] He also was a founding member of the Society for Homosexuals on Campus, a student organization at the University of the Witwatersrand, which later became known as Activate Wits.[44] 
1995 saw the publication of Defiant Desire: Gay and Lesbian Lives in South Africa, "a celebration of the lives of gay men and lesbians in South Africa" which Cameron co-edited with Mark Gevisser.[45]

Cameron's critical role in the battle for access to antiretroviral treatment in Africa and other parts of the global south is portrayed in the award-winning documentary Fire in the Blood.[1]

His father was imprisoned for car theft and his mother did not have the means to support him. 
He therefore spent much of his childhood in an orphanage in Queenstown.[1] His elder sister was killed when Cameron was nine.

Cameron won a scholarship to attend Pretoria Boys’ High School, one of South Africa's best state schools, and reinvented himself, he says, "in the guise of a clever schoolboy".[1] Thereafter he went to Stellenbosch University, studying Latin and classics. 
Here he stayed at Wilgenhof Mens Residence. 
After this he attended Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar.[5] There he switched to law and earned a BA in Jurisprudence and the Bachelor of Civil Law, winning the Vinerian Scholarship.[6] When he returned to South Africa he completed an LLB at the University of South Africa and was its best law graduate. 
Cameron's early career combined academia and legal practice.[7] In 1982, while working as a senior lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand, he famously wrote a scathing critique of the late Chief Justice L. C. Steyn, then a darling of the apartheid establishment.[8] And, in 1987, Cameron argued that three senior South African judges, including its former Chief Justice, Pierre Rabie, ought to resign to preserve the legitimacy of the judiciary.[9] Cameron practised at the Johannesburg Bar from 1983 to 1994. 
From 1986 he was a human rights lawyer at Wits's Centre for Applied Legal Studies, where in 1989 he was awarded a personal professorship in law.[4] Cameron's practice included labour and employment law; defence of African National Congress fighters charged with treason; conscientious and religious objection; land tenure and forced removals; and gay and lesbian equality.[1] In 1992 he became a co-author (with Tony Honoré, one of his mentors at Oxford) of Honoré's South African Law of Trusts.[10] Cameron took silk in 1994.[1]

"The Man Who Sang and The Woman Who Kept Silent' (colloquially known as 'The Blue Dress'); comprising three paintings and a mixed media sculpture, have together come to constitute the signature piece of the Constitutional Court's collection. 
Justice Albie Sachs considers Judith Mason's "The Man Who Sang and the Woman Who Kept Silent" (1998) to be "one of the great pieces of art in the world of the late 20th century" 
This piece was inspired by two stories Mason heard on the radio at the time of the Truth and Reconciliation hearings. 
They told of the execution of two liberation movement cadres by the security police. 
One was Harold Sefola, who as Mason relates, "asked permission to sing Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika" before he was electrocuted; the other was Phila NdwandWe, "who was tortured and kept naked for ten days" and then assassinated in a kneeling position. 
As the TRC found, before NdwandWe was killed, she "fashioned a pair of panties for herself out of a scrap of blue plastic." 
This moved Mason to make a dress of blue plastic bags, inscribed with text beginning: "Sister, a plastic bag may not be the whole armour of God, but you were wrestling with flesh and blood, and against powers, against the rulers of darkness …" 
"Hyenas like artists, are scavengers prowling on the edge of society. 
I love hyaenas because of their other-worldly whooping, their ungainliness and their "bad hair" (I share the latter two characteristics). 
I also regard the animal as a very apt image of the 'id' in opposition to the ego and the super-ego, the monkey on my back. 
In the three lithographs I have depicted The Muse by Day as a Hyaena in guinea fowl's clothing, the spots as disguise or drag to celebrate the gift of mimicry. 
In the Muse by Night I have concentrated on the animal as far-seeing, seer-like with the coat of spots as shaman's eyes. 
In Muse Amused I have tried to celebrate a generally despised animal having an existential guffaw."

Judith Mason born Judith Seelander Menge (10 October 1938 Pretoria – 28 December 2016 White River) was a South African artist who worked in oil, pencil, printmaking and mixed media. 
Her work is rich in symbolism and mythology, displaying a rare technical virtuosity. 
Judith Mason was born in Pretoria; South Africa, in 1938. 
She matriculated at the Pretoria High School for Girls in 1956. 
In 1960, she was awarded a BA Degree in Fine Arts at the University of the Witwatersrand. 
She taught painting at the University of the Witwatersrand, the University of Pretoria, the Michaelis School of Fine Art in Cape Town, Scuola Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence, Italy from 1989 to 1991 and acted as external examiner for under-graduate and post-graduate degrees at Pretoria, Potchefstroom, Natal, Stellenbosch and Cape Town Universities. 
Several of Mason's works deal with the atrocities uncovered by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.[1] Mason died in White River 28 December 2016.[2] 
Mason was politically aware and was motivated by a strong social conscience. 
Her work is informed by people, creatures, events and sometimes works of poetry, that touched or deeply disturbed her. 
Her images run the gamut from expressionist through representational, humorous and starkly symbolic. 
The history, mythology and ritual of Christianity and the eastern religions provided a fertile fund of inspiration for her work. 
Mason felt that formalised theology has destroyed the spiritually-nourishing mythological character of primitive religion. 
"Mason's pieces are sometimes imbued with lyrical and poetic overtones, and sometimes informed by the poetry of Christopher Smart and Wilfred Owen, another important feature of her work is the synthesis she established between beauty and ugliness. 
A beautifully drawn or painted face often gives way to a gaping, snarling monster ... 
The beauty/ugliness, or abjection, dichotomy in Mason's work is no other than an expression of how awful pain is. 
Mason also stated that "All the arts are forms of play."

An exhibition of Dumas's paintings entitled 'The Image as Burden' was exhibited at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Holland from 6 September 2014- 4 January 2015. 
Dumas was born in 1953 in Cape Town, South Africa, and grew up in Kuils River in the Western Cape, where her father had a vineyard.[3][1] She studied art at the University of Cape Town from 1972 to 1975, and then at Ateliers '63 in Haarlem, in North Holland in the Netherlands. 
She studied psychology at the University of Amsterdam in 1979–1980.[2] 
She often uses reference material of polaroid photographs of her friends and lovers, whilst she also references magazines and pornographic material. 
Marlene Dumas also paints portraits of children and erotic scenes to impact the world of contemporary art. 
She has said that her works are better appreciated as originals since many of her smaller sexual works are very intimate.[4] 
Dumas paintings are seen as portraits but they do not represent people but an emotional state that one could be in. 
Her art focuses on more serious issues and themes such as sexuality and race, guilt and innocence, violence and tenderness.[5] Dumas style is more older romanticism tradition. 
She uses loose brushstrokes to add distortion but also great detail to her art. 
[6] 
Her first major American museum exhibition, a midcareer retrospective entitled "Measuring Your Own Grave", opened in June 2008 at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and moved to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. 
Dumas's paintings were exhibited at the 2003 Venice Biennale.[8] 
Although it was widely believed that a majority of the population favoured retention of the death penalty, the court affirmed its commitment to its duties as an independent arbiter of the Constitution.[10] It would not act merely as a vector for public opinion: 
S v Makwanyane and Another (CCT 3/94) was a landmark 1995 judgement of the Constitutional Court of South Africa. 
It established that capital punishment was inconsistent with the commitment to human rights expressed in the Interim Constitution. 
The court's ruling invalidated section 277(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977, which had provided for use of the death penalty, along with any similar provisions in any other law in force in South Africa. 
The court also forbade the government from carrying out the death sentence on any prisoners awaiting execution,[1] ruling that they should remain in prison until new sentences were imposed.[2] Delivered on 6 June, this was the newly established court's "first politically important and publicly controversial holding."[3] 
The outcome may be dependent upon factors such as the way the case is investigated by the police, the way the case is presented by the prosecutor, how effectively the accused is defended, the personality and particular attitude to capital punishment of the trial judge and, if the matter goes on appeal, the particular judges who are selected to hear the case. 
Race and poverty are also alleged to be factors.[4] 
The Court held further that the rights to life and dignity were the most important of all human rights and the source of all the other personal rights detailed in Chapter 3 of the Interim Constitution. 
Having committed to a society premised on the recognition and realisation of human rights, the State was required to value these two rights above all others, and to demonstrate that valuation in everything it did, including the punishment of criminals. 
This would not be achieved by depersonalising and executing murderers, even as a deterrent to others.[5] Quite apart from the fact that vengeance or payback had not the same constitutional heft as the right to life and the right to dignity, the court was not satisfied that it had been shown that capital punishment would be more effective as a deterrent than a life sentence.[6] Chaskalson P, writing for the majority, concluded that 
The court also affirmed its commitment to the principle of constitutionalism, and more specifically constitutional values such as freedom, dignity and equality, by rejecting the "arbitrary and capricious" nature of the death penalty.[1] Ackermann J made this much clear in his judgment: 
Economic Freedom Fighters v Speaker of the National Assembly and Others; Democratic Alliance v Speaker of the National Assembly and Others [2016] ZACC 11 is a major judgment of the Constitutional Court of South Africa which finds that President Jacob Zuma breached the South African Constitution by failing to implement the recommendations in the Public Protector's Nkandla report. 
The hearing took place on 9 February 2016.[28] At it, Zuma's counsel, Jeremy Gauntlett SC, made a series of major concessions, including that the Nkandla report was binding on Zuma, but asked the Court not to declare that Zuma had acted unconstitutionally.[28] The issue was significant because such a declaration would be a basis for Zuma's impeachment.[28] Zuma's strategy was perceived as an attempt to evade responsibility and throw his ministers under the bus.[28][29] Minister Nhleko's legal team, in turn, said his "hands were tied" because he was following instructions from Zuma and the National Assembly.[29] Only Speaker Baleka Mbete's counsel, Lindi Nkosi-Thomas SC, seriously disputed the EFF and DA's account of the facts and law, but was ultimately forced to capitulate and was widely mocked for her "bumbling" performance.[29][30] 
Mogoeng's "powerful" and "profound" judgment was hailed as a "triumph for the rule of law", and a major blow to the widely criticised President, of whose conduct the judgment was "scathing".[34][35][36][37][38][39][40] One commentator said Mogoeng's judgment was "his moment of triumph and redemption", and marked his transformation from a supposed "tool" of the establishment to a "national hero" in a manner reminiscent of Earl Warren.[41] Political analyst Steven Friedman said the judgment was "the clearest message yet that the Constitution is working";[42] another commentator said the judgment's importance was that "it is a muscular assertion that all rule in this country is subject to the Constitution".[43] Former President Thabo Mbeki said the judges of the Constitutional Court should be "salute[d]" for "the meticulous manner in which they discharged their constitutional responsibilities as our apex court".[44] Justice Edwin Cameron, who sat in the case, suggested in a public address that it was one of the Court's two most significant ever judgments.[45] One commentator noted, however, that President Zuma's counsel had conceded most of the points the Court decided against him.[46] 
But the ANC continued to support Zuma. 
The ANC Women's League had released a statement hours after the judgment saying its faith in Zuma "remains unshaken".[57][58] Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe, speaking on behalf of the so-called Top Six, said he "welcomed" Zuma's apologetic statement but that calls for his impeachment were "over-exaggerated".[59][60] Chief whip Jackson Mthembu and Deputy Minister of Justice John Jeffery took the view that, although Zuma had breached the Constitution, the breach was not "serious".[61][62] The impeachment bid by opposition MPs on 5 April 2016 failed by over 120 votes.[62] Some were surprised that even Zuma's opponents within the ANC like Cyril Ramaphosa and Pravin Gordhan had voted against the motion.[7][64] The Congress of the People, an opposition party, said it would boycott parliamentary proceedings in light of the National Assembly's failure to implement the Court's judgment.[65] 
Nevertheless, many analysts said the judgment might prove a fatal blow to Zuma, although factional battles within the ANC would be the ultimate decider.[1][66][67] One suggested that powerful ANC members had lost faith in Zuma and might move to oust him at a more opportune moment.[63] The South African Communist Party, part of Zuma's own tripartite alliance, had been skeptical about the adequacy of his response to the judgment.[68] Some ANC members booed Zuma at his next subsequent appearance.[69] And several prominent members of civil society and former ANC insiders, including Ahmed Kathrada, Ronnie Kasrils, Trevor Manuel, Cheryl Carolus, and retired Constitutional Court judge Zak Yacoob, called for Zuma's resignation,[70][71][72][73] prompting a backlash from certain Zuma allies.[74] The South African Council of Churches did the same, saying Zuma had "lost all moral authority".[75][76] The Gauteng ANC, led by noted Zuma critic Paul Mashatile, formally resolved that Zuma must resign;[77][78] doubts were raised about Zuma's leadership even within his traditional strongholds like the ANC's Limpopo branches;[79] and an internal ANC memorandum sent by party veterans to the Top Six allegedly demanded Zuma's recall and compared him to detested apartheid-era President P. W. Botha.[76] Finally, members of the Gupta family, thought to be Zuma's long-standing allies and crucial financial backers, resigned from their major holding company and fled South Africa for Dubai in the week after the judgment – leaving Zuma, in the opinion of some analysts, extremely vulnerable.[80][81] In the wake of these developments, Malema said it was now time to "crush the head of the snake".[82] On 12 April 2016, Max du Preez said the key question, "now that the balance of power has turned irrevocably against Zuma", was how to ensure he makes a managed — and non-violent — exit.[83] 
In 2009, during President Zuma's first term, his Nkandla homestead was extensively renovated and upgraded.[1][2] The Presidency said these were lawful security upgrades.[3] However, it soon emerged that the upgrades included non-security features like a swimming pool and cattle kraal. 
The Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela, began an investigation into the apparent misuse of state resources. 
On 19 March 2014, she released her so-called Nkandla report, which found that some of the upgrades were unlawful and recommended that President Zuma pay back the money used for them.[4] 
The report proved highly controversial, as Zuma and his ANC government refused to act on it and questioned its legitimacy.[5] On three occasions during 2014, the Presidency wrote letters to the Public Protector taking a skeptical attitude to the report.[2] On 14 August 2014 Zuma said he would allow Parliament, and the Minister of Police, to determine what remedial steps, if any, he should take.[6] He later denied that the Public Protector's recommendations were legally binding.[7] Zuma's evasiveness led to severe and widespread criticism, including by opposition parties the Economic Freedom Fighters and Democratic Alliance. 
EFF MPs frequently interrupted parliamentary proceedings to demand that Zuma "pay back the money",[8][9] leading to confrontations between them and Speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete, considered by some to be partial to Zuma in her management of parliamentary proceedings.[10][11][12] On one such occasion, at Zuma's 2015 State of the Nation address, these interruptions led to brawl between MPs and security personnel and a subsequent court action (which was decided against the government).[13][14] When Zuma appeared in Parliament he repeatedly ignored or laughed off questions about Nkandla.[15][16][17] Eventually the EFF announced, in May 2015, that it would file a court application to compel Zuma to act on the Public Protector's report.[18][19] The DA filed a similar application shortly thereafter.[20]

Joe Slovo (born Yossel Mashel Slovo; 23 May 1926 – 6 January 1995) was a South African politician, and an opponent of the apartheid system. 
A Marxist-Leninist, he was a long-time leader and theorist in the South African Communist Party (SACP), a leading member of the African National Congress (ANC), and a commander of the ANC's military wing Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK). 
Cinema and music 
A South African citizen from a Jewish-Lithuanian family, Slovo was a delegate to the multiracial Congress of the People of June 1955 which drew up the Freedom Charter. 
He was imprisoned for six months in 1960, and emerged as a leader of Umkhonto we Sizwe the following year. 
He lived in exile from 1963 to 1990, conducting operations against the apartheid régime from the United Kingdom, Angola, Mozambique, and Zambia. 
In 1990 he returned to South Africa, and took part in the negotiations that ended apartheid. 
He became known for proposing the "sunset clauses" covering the 5 years following a democratic election, including guarantees and concessions to all sides,[1] and a fierce non-racialism stance. 
After the elections of 1994, he became Minister for Housing in Nelson Mandela's government. 
He died of cancer in 1995.[2] 
Slovo joined the South African Communist Party in 1942. 
Inspired by the Red Army's battles against the Nazis on the Eastern Front of World War II, Slovo volunteered to fight in the war. 
He served as a Signaler in combat operations for the South African forces in North Africa and Italy, and on his return to South Africa he joined the Springbok Legion, a multiracial radical ex-servicemen's organization.[4][5] 
In 1950, the SACP was banned and both First and Slovo were listed as communists under the Suppression of Communism Act and could not be quoted or attend public gatherings in South Africa. 
He became active in the South African Congress of Democrats (an ally of the ANC as part of the Congress Alliance) and was a delegate to the June 1955 Congress of the People organised by the ANC and Indian, Coloured and white organisations at Kliptown near Johannesburg, that drew up the Freedom Charter. 
He was arrested and detained for two months during the Treason Trial of 1956. 
Charges against him were dropped in 1958. 
He was later arrested for six months during the State of Emergency declared after the Sharpeville massacre in 1960. 
Prior to Luthuli's involvement with the African National Congress (ANC) Luthuli also had served on the executive committee of the Christian Council of South Africa. 
Luthuli was one of its delegates to an International Missionary Conference held in Madras, India, in 1938. 
Inkosi Albert John Lutuli (commonly spelled Luthuli;[lower-alpha 1] c. 1898 – 21 July 1967), also known by his Zulu name Mvumbi, was a South African teacher, activist, Nobel Peace Prize winner, and politician. 
Luthuli was elected president of the African National Congress (ANC) in 1952, at the time an umbrella organisation that led opposition to the white minority government in South Africa, and served until his accidental death. 
He was awarded the 1960 Nobel Peace Prize for his role in the non-violent struggle against apartheid. 
He was the first person of African heritage to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 
Luthuli was a lay preacher of the United Congregational Church of Southern Africa (UCCSA) based at its Groutville Congregational Church in Stanger, KwaZulu Natal, where Luthuli was laid to rest upon his passing in 1967. 
Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development v Prince [2018] ZACC 30 is a decision of the Constitutional Court of South Africa delivered on 18 September 2018, which found that it is unconstitutional for the state to criminalize the possession, use or cultivation of cannabis by adults for personal consumption in private. 
The court gave Parliament 24 months to amend the affected legislation, but also granted interim relief which had the effect of immediately making it legal for adults to use cannabis in private, possess cannabis in private for personal use, and cultivate cannabis in a private place for personal consumption.[1] 
Minister of Home Affairs and Another v Fourie and Another; Lesbian and Gay Equality Project and Others v Minister of Home Affairs and Others, [2005] ZACC 19,[1][2][3], is a landmark decision of the Constitutional Court of South Africa in which the court ruled unanimously that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. 
The judgment, authored by Justice Albie Sachs and delivered on 1 December 2005, gave Parliament one year to pass the necessary legislation. 
As a result, the Civil Union Act came into force on 30 November 2006, making South Africa the fifth country in the world to recognise same-sex marriage. 
The court's finding was based on section 9 of the Constitution of South Africa, particularly on the right to equal protection and benefit of the law in section 9(1) and the explicit prohibition on Discrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation, in section 9(3). 
The common law and section 30(1) of the Marriage Act denied same-sex couples equal protection and benefit of the law, in conflict with section 9(1) of the Constitution, and taken together resulted in same-sex couples being subjected to unfair discrimination by the State, in conflict with section 9(3) of the Constitution.[8] When evaluated in the context of the legal regime as a whole, the common-law definition of marriage and section 30(1) of the Marriage Act were under-inclusive, Sachs found, and unconstitutional to the extent that they made no appropriate provision for gay and lesbian people to celebrate their unions in the same way that they enabled heterosexual couples to do.[9] This violation of the equality and dignity rights of same-sex couples was not justified as contemplated in section 36 of the Constitution.[10] 
The case was heard on May 17, 2005, by Langa ACJ, Madala J, Mokgoro J, Moseneke J, Ngcobo J, O'Regan J, Sachs J, Skweyiya J, Yacoob J and Van Der Westhuizen J. MTK Moerane SC (with S. Nthai) appeared for the applicants, P Oosthuizen (with T Kathri) for the respondents, JJ Smyth QC for the first and second amici curiae, GC Pretorius SC (with DM Achtzehn, PG Seleka and JR Bauer) for the third amicus curiae, DI Berger SC (with F Kathree) for the applicants, and M Donen SC for the respondents. 
In the Fourie case, the applicants' counsel was instructed by the State Attorney, and the respondents' by M. van den Berg. 
The third amicus curiae was instructed by Motla Conradie. 
In the Lesbian and Gay Equality Project case, the applicants' counsel was instructed by Nicholls, Cambanis & Associates, and the respondents' by the State Attorney. 
The court noted that South Africa has a multitude of family formations that are evolving rapidly as society develops, so that it is inappropriate to entrench any particular form as the only socially and legally acceptable one. 
There is an imperative constitutional need to acknowledge the long history in South Africa and abroad of marginalisation and persecution of gays and Lesbians, although a number of breakthroughs have been made in particular areas. 
The court also found that there is no comprehensive legal regulation of the family law rights of gays and lesbians, and that the Constitution represents a radical rupture with a past based on intolerance and exclusion, and the movement forward to the acceptance of the need to develop a society based on equality and respect by all for all. 
The Court pointed out that what was at issue was the need to affirm the character of the society as one based on Tolerance and mutual respect. 
Marriage Act 25 of 1961. 
The definition of marriage in South African common law is drawn from the Roman-Dutch law, and until the Fourie case it was described as "a union of one man with one woman, to the exclusion, while it lasts, of all others".[4] This definition excluded same-sex unions; it also excluded polygamous or potentially polygamous unions like Muslim marriage and marriages under customary law in South Africa. 
The Marriage Act(South Africa),[5] the statute which regulates the formalities of the marriage ceremony, does not make any explicit mention of the genders of the spouses. 
However, section 30(1) of the act (as substituted by the Marriage Amendment Act, 1973) requires the marriage officer to ask each party to the marriage: 
Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela (1880–1928), was a local chief and councillor to the monarch; he was appointed to the position in 1915, after his predecessor was accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate.[9] In 1926, Gadla was also sacked for corruption, but Nelson was told that his father had lost his job for standing up to the magistrate's unreasonable demands.[10] A devotee of the god Qamata,[11] Gadla was a polygamist with four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who lived in different villages. 
Nelson's mother was Gadla's third wife, Nosekeni Fanny, daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand House and a member of the amaMpemvu clan of the Xhosa.[12] 
Mandela stepped down as ANC President at the party's December 1997 conference. 
He hoped that Ramaphosa would succeed him, believing Mbeki to be too inflexible and intolerant of criticism, but the ANC elected Mbeki regardless.[311] Mandela and the Executive supported Jacob Zuma, a Zulu who had been imprisoned on Robben Island, as Mbeki's replacement for Deputy President. 
Zuma's candidacy was challenged by Winnie, whose populist rhetoric had gained her a strong following within the party, although Zuma defeated her in a landslide victory vote at the election.[312] 
Mandela later stated that his early life was dominated by traditional Thembu custom and taboo.[14] He grew up with two sisters in his mother's kraal in the village of Qunu, where he tended herds as a cattle-boy and spent much time outside with other boys.[15] Both his parents were illiterate, but being a devout Christian, his mother sent him to a local Methodist school when he was about seven. 
Baptised a Methodist, Mandela was given the English forename of "Nelson" by his teacher.[16] When Mandela was about nine, his father came to stay at Qunu, where he died of an undiagnosed ailment which Mandela believed to be lung disease.[17] Feeling "cut adrift", he later said that he inherited his father's "proud rebelliousness" and "stubborn sense of fairness".[18] 
Mandela's 90th birthday was marked across the country on 18 July 2008, with the main celebrations held at Qunu,[336] and a concert in his honour in Hyde Park, London.[337] In a speech marking the event, Mandela called for the rich to help the poor across the world.[336] Throughout Mbeki's presidency, Mandela continued to support the ANC, usually overshadowing Mbeki at any public events that the two attended. 
Mandela was more at ease with Mbeki's successor, Zuma,[338] although the Nelson Mandela Foundation was upset when his grandson, Mandla Mandela, flew him out to the Eastern Cape to attend a pro-Zuma rally in the midst of a storm in 2009.[338] 
Mandela's mother took him to the "Great Place" palace at Mqhekezweni, where he was entrusted to the guardianship of the Thembu regent, Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo. 
Although he did not see his mother again for many years, Mandela felt that Jongintaba and his wife Noengland treated him as their own child, raising him alongside their son, Justice, and daughter, Nomafu.[19] As Mandela attended church services every Sunday with his guardians, Christianity became a significant part of his life.[20] He attended a Methodist mission school located next to the palace, where he studied English, Xhosa, history and geography.[21] He developed a love of African history, listening to the tales told by elderly visitors to the palace, and was influenced by the anti-imperialist rhetoric of a visiting chief, Joyi.[22] At the time he nevertheless considered the European colonialists not as oppressors but as benefactors who had brought education and other benefits to southern Africa.[23] Aged 16, he, Justice and several other boys travelled to Tyhalarha to undergo the ulwaluko circumcision ritual that symbolically marked their transition from boys to men; afterwards he was given the name Dalibunga.[24] 
Intending to gain skills needed to become a privy councillor for the Thembu royal house, in 1933 Mandela began his secondary education at Clarkebury Methodist High School in Engcobo, a Western-style institution that was the largest school for black Africans in Thembuland.[25] Made to socialise with other students on an equal basis, he claimed that he lost his "stuck up" attitude, becoming best friends with a girl for the first time; he began playing sports and developed his lifelong love of gardening.[26] He completed his Junior Certificate in two years,[27] and in 1937 moved to Healdtown, the Methodist college in Fort Beaufort attended by most Thembu royalty, including Justice.[28] The headmaster emphasised the superiority of English culture and government, but Mandela became increasingly interested in native African culture, making his first non-Xhosa friend, a speaker of Sotho, and coming under the influence of one of his favourite teachers, a Xhosa who broke taboo by marrying a Sotho.[29] Mandela spent much of his spare time at Healdtown as a long-distance runner and boxer, and in his second year he became a prefect.[30] 
Returning to Mqhekezweni in December 1940, Mandela found that Jongintaba had arranged marriages for him and Justice; dismayed, they fled to Johannesburg via Queenstown, arriving in April 1941.[40] Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines, his "first sight of South African capitalism in action", but was fired when the induna (headman) discovered that he was a runaway.[41] He stayed with a cousin in George Goch Township, who introduced Mandela to realtor and ANC activist Walter Sisulu. 
The latter secured Mandela a job as an articled clerk at the law firm of Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman, a company run by Lazar Sidelsky, a liberal Jew sympathetic to the ANC's cause.[42] At the firm, Mandela befriended Gaur Radebe—a Xhosa member of the ANC and Communist Party—and Nat Bregman, a Jewish communist who became his first white friend.[43] Mandela attended Communist Party gatherings, where he was impressed that Europeans, Africans, Indians, and Coloureds mixed as equals. 
He later stated that he did not join the Party because its atheism conflicted with his Christian faith, and because he saw the South African struggle as being racially based rather than as class warfare.[44] To continue his higher education, Mandela signed up to a University of South Africa correspondence course, working on his bachelor's degree at night.[45] 
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (/mænˈdɛlə/;[1] Xhosa: [xolíɬaɬa mandɛ̂ːla]; 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. 
He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. 
His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation. 
Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997. 
A Xhosa, Mandela was born to the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, British South Africa. 
He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. 
There he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944. 
After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, he and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. 
Mandela was appointed President of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. 
He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. 
Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party (SACP). 
Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. 
He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state following the Rivonia Trial. 
Mandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island, Pollsmoor Prison, and Victor Verster Prison. 
Amid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. 
Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president. 
Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. 
Economically, Mandela's administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services. 
Internationally, he acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. 
He declined a second presidential term, and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. 
Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation. 
By the late 1960s, Mandela's fame had been eclipsed by Steve Biko and the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM). 
Seeing the ANC as ineffectual, the BCM called for militant action, but following the Soweto uprising of 1976, many BCM activists were imprisoned on Robben Island.[170] Mandela tried to build a relationship with these young radicals, although he was critical of their racialism and contempt for white anti-apartheid activists.[171] Renewed international interest in his plight came in July 1978, when he celebrated his 60th birthday.[172] He was awarded an honorary doctorate in Lesotho, the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding in India in 1979, and the Freedom of the City of Glasgow, Scotland in 1981.[173] In March 1980, the slogan "Free Mandela!" was developed by journalist Percy Qoboza, sparking an international campaign that led the UN Security Council to call for his release.[174] Despite increasing foreign pressure, the government refused, relying on its Cold War allies US President Ronald Reagan and UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher; both considered Mandela's ANC a terrorist organisation sympathetic to communism, and supported its suppression.[175] 
In April 1982, Mandela was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada, and Raymond Mhlaba; they believed that they were being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists at Robben Island.[176] Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than at Robben Island, although Mandela missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island.[177] Getting on well with Pollsmoor's commanding officer, Brigadier Munro, Mandela was permitted to create a roof garden;[178] he also read voraciously and corresponded widely, now permitted 52 letters a year.[179] He was appointed patron of the multi-racial United Democratic Front (UDF), founded to combat reforms implemented by South African President P. W. Botha. 
Botha's National Party government had permitted Coloured and Indian citizens to vote for their own parliaments, which had control over education, health, and housing, but black Africans were excluded from the system; like Mandela, the UDF saw this as an attempt to divide the anti-apartheid movement on racial lines.[180] 
Mandela was given an office in the newly purchased ANC headquarters at Shell House, Johannesburg, and moved into Winnie's large Soweto home.[214] Their marriage was increasingly strained as he learned of her affair with Dali Mpofu, but he supported her during her trial for kidnapping and assault. 
He gained funding for her defence from the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa and from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, but in June 1991 she was found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison, reduced to two on appeal. 
On 13 April 1992, Mandela publicly announced his separation from Winnie. 
The ANC forced her to step down from the national executive for misappropriating ANC funds; Mandela moved into the mostly white Johannesburg suburb of Houghton.[215] Mandela's prospects for a peaceful transition were further damaged by an increase in "black-on-black" violence, particularly between ANC and Inkatha supporters in KwaZulu-Natal, which resulted in thousands of deaths. 
Mandela met with Inkatha leader Buthelezi, but the ANC prevented further negotiations on the issue. 
Mandela argued that there was a "third force" within the state intelligence services fuelling the "slaughter of the people" and openly blamed de Klerk—whom he increasingly distrusted—for the Sebokeng massacre.[216] In September 1991, a national peace conference was held in Johannesburg at which Mandela, Buthelezi and de Klerk signed a peace accord, though the violence continued.[217] 
The Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) began in December 1991 at the Johannesburg World Trade Centre, attended by 228 delegates from 19 political parties. 
Although Cyril Ramaphosa led the ANC's delegation, Mandela remained a key figure, and after de Klerk used the closing speech to condemn the ANC's violence, he took to the stage to denounce de Klerk as the "head of an illegitimate, discredited minority regime". 
Dominated by the National Party and ANC, little negotiation was achieved.[218] CODESA 2 was held in May 1992, at which de Klerk insisted that post-apartheid South Africa must use a federal system with a rotating presidency to ensure the protection of ethnic minorities; Mandela opposed this, demanding a unitary system governed by majority rule.[219] Following the Boipatong massacre of ANC activists by government-aided Inkatha militants, Mandela called off the negotiations, before attending a meeting of the Organisation of African Unity in Senegal, at which he called for a special session of the UN Security Council and proposed that a UN peacekeeping force be stationed in South Africa to prevent "state terrorism".[220] Calling for domestic mass action, in August the ANC organised the largest-ever strike in South African history, and supporters marched on Pretoria.[221] 
The democratic process was threatened by the Concerned South Africans Group (COSAG), an alliance of black ethnic-secessionist groups like Inkatha and far-right Afrikaner parties; in June 1993, one of the latter—the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB)—attacked the Kempton Park World Trade Centre.[225] Following the murder of ANC activist Chris Hani, Mandela made a publicised speech to calm rioting, soon after appearing at a mass funeral in Soweto for Tambo, who had died of a stroke.[226] In July 1993, both Mandela and de Klerk visited the US, independently meeting President Bill Clinton and each receiving the Liberty Medal.[227] Soon after, Mandela and de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway.[228] Influenced by Thabo Mbeki, Mandela began meeting with big business figures, and played down his support for nationalisation, fearing that he would scare away much-needed foreign investment. 
Although criticised by socialist ANC members, he had been encouraged to embrace private enterprise by members of the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist parties at the January 1992 World Economic Forum in Switzerland.[229] 
Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province.[2] Given the forename Rolihlahla,[3] a Xhosa term colloquially meaning "troublemaker",[4] in later years he became known by his clan name, Madiba.[5] His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was king of the Thembu people in the Transkeian Territories of South Africa's modern Eastern Cape province.[6] One of Ngubengcuka's sons, named Mandela, was Nelson's grandfather and the source of his surname.[7] Because Mandela was the king's child by a wife of the Ixhiba clan, a so-called "Left-Hand House", the descendants of his cadet branch of the royal family were morganatic, ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary royal councillors.[8] 
Concerned that COSAG would undermine the election, particularly in the wake of the conflict in Bophuthatswana and the Shell House massacre—incidents of violence involving the AWB and Inkatha, respectively—Mandela met with Afrikaner politicians and generals, including P. W. Botha, Pik Botha and Constand Viljoen, persuading many to work within the democratic system. 
With de Klerk, he also convinced Inkatha's Buthelezi to enter the elections rather than launch a war of secession.[235] As leaders of the two major parties, de Klerk and Mandela appeared on a televised debate; although de Klerk was widely considered the better speaker at the event, Mandela's offer to shake his hand surprised him, leading some commentators to deem it a victory for Mandela.[236] The election went ahead with little violence, although an AWB cell killed 20 with car bombs. 
As widely expected, the ANC won a sweeping victory, taking 63% of the vote, just short of the two-thirds majority needed to unilaterally change the constitution. 
The ANC was also victorious in seven provinces, with Inkatha and the National Party each taking another.[237][238] Mandela voted at the Ohlange High School in Durban, and though the ANC's victory assured his election as President, he publicly accepted that the election had been marred by instances of fraud and sabotage.[239][240]

The politics of the Western Cape are more complex than in most other provinces of South Africa, because, unlike the other provinces, the African National Congress (ANC) does not dominate the political landscape. 
In the election of 2004, no party achieved an absolute majority in the province, with the ANC having a plurality of 45% of the votes. 
However, the ANC was in an alliance with the New National Party (NNP), which had 11% of the votes, which allowed the ANC-NNP coalition to form a provincial government. 
During the 2005 floor crossing period all of the NNP members of the Provincial Parliament moved to the ANC, giving the ANC an absolute majority in the province. 
The ANC chose Ebrahim Rasool as Premier; in 2008 he was replaced by Lynne Brown. 
The provincial leader of the ANC is Mcebisi Skwatsha. 
The official opposition in the Western Cape after the 2004 elections was the Democratic Alliance (DA), which received 27% of the vote in the provincial ballot. 
The City of Cape Town, the most populous municipality in the province, was governed by a multi-party coalition led by the DA after the 2006 municipal elections. 
The DA increased its share of the vote during the 2011 municipal elections to 61.09%, giving them a firm majority and allowing them to govern the City of Cape Town without their former coalition partners [1] 
In the election of 22 April 2009 the ANC was unseated by the DA, which took 51.46% of the vote.[2] This election marked the first time since the end of apartheid that a party scored an overall majority in the province. 
The DA leader Helen Zille replaced Lynne Brown as Premier on 6 May 2009.[3] 
In the election of 7 May 2014 the DA maintained its hold on the province, increasing its majority to 59.4%.

Black people from South Africa were at times officially called Bantu (Afrikaans: Bantoe) by the apartheid regime. 
The term Bantu is derived from the word for "people" common to many of the Bantu languages. 
The Oxford Dictionary of South African English describes its contemporary usage in a racial context as "obsolescent and offensive" because of its strong association with white minority rule and the apartheid system. 
However, Bantu is used without pejorative connotations in other parts of Africa and still appropriately used in South Africa to denote as the name for the languages Black people of South Africa speak than it being used as the name or labeling of these people. 
Chiefdom 
Until very recently, Bantu-speaking communities were often divided into different clans, not around national federations, but independent groups from some hundreds to thousands of individuals. 
The smallest unit of the political organizational structure was the household, or kraal, consisting of a man, woman or women, and their children, as well as other relatives living in the same household. 
The man was the head of the household and often had many wives, and was the family's primary representative. 
The household and close relations generally played an important role. 
Households which lived in the same valley or on the same hill in a village were also an organizational unit, managed by a sub-chief. 
Chiefdom-ship was largely hereditary, although chiefs were often replaced when not effective. 
In most clans the eldest son inherited the office of his father. 
In some clans the office was left to the oldest brother of the deceased chief, and after his death again the next oldest brother. 
This repeated until the last brother died. 
Next was the eldest son of the original chieftain; then the oldest one of the brothers as the leader. 
The chief was surrounded with a number of trusted friends or advisors, usually relatives like uncles and brothers, rather than influential headmen or personal friends. 
The degree of the democracy depended on the strength of the chieftain. 
The more powerful and more influential a chieftain was, the lesser the influence of his people. 
Although the leader had much power, he was not above the law. 
He could be criticized both by advisors as well as by his people, and compensation could be demanded. 
The people were divided into different clans or tribes which had their own functions, laws, and language. 
South Africa's Bantu-speaking communities are roughly classified into four main groups: Nguni, Sotho–Tswana, Vhavenda and Shangana Tsonga, with the Nguni representing the largest group. 
These are divided as follows (this list is not exhaustive): 
Nguni Northern Nguni Swati Zulu Ndebele Southern Nguni Xhosa Hlubi Mpondo Mpondomise Thembu Shangana-Tsonga Sotho–Tswana Basotho Northern Sotho Balobedu Bapedi Mapulana Batswana Vhavenda Vhalemba (speaking Tshivenda) Diasporas in Africa (this sub-list is not exhaustive). 
Northern Ndebele Ngoni Lozi 
Common among the two powerful divisions of the Nguni and the Sotho–Tswana are patrilineal societies, in which the leaders formed the socio-political units. 
Similarly, food acquisition was by cultivation and hunting. 
The most important differences are the strongly deviating languages, although both are Southern Bantu languages, and the different settlement types and relationships. 
In the Nguni settlements villages were widely scattered, whereas the Sotho–Tswana settled in towns. 
History regarding indigenous South African bantu speakers has in the past significantly been affected by deliberate propagation and attempts of successfully entrenching untruthful narratives through orientation based on racism interests eg. 
Empty land myth,[1] and preservation ways on the side of the indigenous South Africans (including Khoisan groups) couldn't effectively defend against the manipulation in those past times. 
Traditionally, Bantu speakers were not territorially minded like the Europeans, but rather group-related. 
As long as sufficient land was available, they had only very vague conceptions of borders. 
Borders were natural features such as rivers or mountains, which were not by any means fixed. 
Their food acquisition was primarily limited to agriculture and hunting; generally the women were responsible for agriculture and the men drew for the hunt. 
Except with the Tsonga (and partially the Mpondo), fishing was of surprisingly little importance. 
The diet consisted of corn (introduced from South-East Asia), meat (mostly wild game, boar, and beef), vegetables, milk, water and grain beer. 
There were a number of taboos regarding the consumption of meat. 
No meat of dogs, apes, crocodiles or snakes could be eaten. 
Likewise taboo was the meat of some birds, like owls, crows and vultures, as well as the flesh of certain totem animals. 
Earliest found presence relating to bantu languages speakers associated activities in the Southern African region is from three archaeologically researched sites dated 4th to 1st century BCE, elaborately 354 to 68 BCE when combining the three sites dating calibration, located in the southernmost region of what's now Mozambique they are named Zitundo, University Campus and Changalane II. Sites within what's now South Africa the oldest found presence of indigenous South African bantu speakers is a site named Silver Leaves dated between 209-370 CE.[2] Taking from found 2nd millennium CE sites of South Africa the probable oldest of that time is named Riverside and dated 981-1127 CE. 
When the early Portuguese sailors (cf. 
Vasco Da Gama and Bartholomew Dias) rounded the Cape of Good Hope in the 15th century AD a number of Bantu speakers were found there. 
The indigenous population around the Cape was made up of the Khoisan groups being the most. 
Following the establishment of the Dutch Cape Colony, European settlers began arriving in Southern Africa in substantial numbers. 
Around 1770, Trekboers from the Cape encountered more presence of Bantu speakers around the Great Fish River and frictions arose between the two groups.[citation needed] 
From the late 18th and early 19th centuries, there were two major areas of frictional contact between the white settlers and the Bantu speakers in Southern Africa. 
Firstly, as the Boers moved north inland from the Cape they encountered the Xhosa, the Basotho, and the Tswana. 
Secondly attempts at large coastal settlements were made by the British in Xhosa territory (now the Eastern Cape), and in Zululand (now KwaZulu-Natal). 
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), previously Science, Math, Engineering and Technology (SMET),[1] is a term used to group together these academic disciplines.[2] This term is typically used when addressing education policy and curriculum choices in schools to improve competitiveness in science and technology development. 
It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns and immigration policy.[2] The science in STEM typically refers to two out of the three major branches of science: natural sciences, including biology, physics, and chemistry, and formal sciences, of which mathematics is an example, along with logic and statistics; the third major branch of science, social sciences, including psychology, sociology, and political science, are categorized separately from the other two branches of science, and are instead grouped together with humanities and arts to form another counterpart acronym named HASS - Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences.[3] In the United States education system, in elementary, middle, and high schools, the term science refers primarily to the natural sciences, with mathematics being a standalone subject, and the social sciences are combined with the humanities under the umbrella term social studies. 
Women constitute 47% of the U.S. workforce, and perform 24% of STEM-related jobs.[92] In the UK women perform 13% of STEM-related jobs (2014).[93] In the U.S. women with STEM degrees are more likely to work in education or healthcare rather than STEM fields compared with their male counterparts. 
The gender ratio depends on field of study. 
For example, in the European Union in 2012 women made up 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business and law, 42% of the science, mathematics and computing, 28% of engineering, manufacturing and construction, and 59% of PhD graduates in Health and Welfare.[94] 
The Universe represented as multiple disk-shaped slices across time, which passes from left to right. 
Science (from the Latin word scientia, meaning "knowledge")[1] is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.[2][3][4] 
The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.[5][6] Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes.[5][6] After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages[7] but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age.[8] The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived "natural philosophy",[7][9] which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century[10] as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions.[11][12][13][14] The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape;[15][16][13] along with the changing of "natural philosophy" to "natural science."[18] 
Modern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study nature in the broadest sense; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which study abstract concepts. 
There is disagreement,[19][20] however, on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence.[21] Disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine, are described as applied sciences.[22][23][24][25] 
Science is based on research, which is commonly conducted in academic and research institutions as well as in government agencies and companies. 
The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products, armaments, health care, and environmental protection. 
Galileo di Vincenzo Bonaulti de Galilei[2] ([ɡaliˈlɛːo ɡaliˈlɛi]; 15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642) was an Italian astronomer, physicist and engineer, sometimes described as a polymath, from Pisa.[3] Galileo has been called the "father of observational astronomy",[4] the "father of modern physics",[5][6] the "father of the scientific method",[7] and the "father of modern science".[8] 
Galileo studied speed and velocity, gravity and free fall, the principle of relativity, inertia, projectile motion and also worked in applied science and technology, describing the properties of pendulums and "hydrostatic balances", inventing the thermoscope and various military compasses, and using the telescope for scientific observations of celestial objects. 
His contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the observation of the four largest satellites of Jupiter, the observation of Saturn's rings, and the analysis of sunspots. 
Galileo's championing of heliocentrism and Copernicanism was controversial during his lifetime, when most subscribed to geocentric models such as the Tychonic system.[9] He met with opposition from astronomers, who doubted heliocentrism because of the absence of an observed stellar parallax.[9] The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, which concluded that heliocentrism was "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture".[9][10][11] 
Galileo made original contributions to the science of motion through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics.[120] More typical of science at the time were the qualitative studies of William Gilbert, on magnetism and electricity. 
Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galilei, a lutenist and music theorist, had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non-linear relation in physics: for a stretched string, the pitch varies as the square root of the tension.[121] These observations lay within the framework of the Pythagorean tradition of music, well known to instrument makers, which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale. 
Thus, a limited amount of mathematics had long related music and physical science, and young Galileo could see his own father's observations expand on that tradition.[122] 
Galileo was one of the first modern thinkers to clearly state that the laws of nature are mathematical. 
In The Assayer, he wrote "Philosophy is written in this grand book, the universe ... 
It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures;...."[123] His mathematical analyses are a further development of a tradition employed by late scholastic natural philosophers, which Galileo learned when he studied philosophy.[124] His work marked another step towards the eventual separation of science from both philosophy and religion; a major development in human thought. 
He was often willing to change his views in accordance with observation. 
In order to perform his experiments, Galileo had to set up standards of length and time, so that measurements made on different days and in different laboratories could be compared in a reproducible fashion. 
This provided a reliable foundation on which to confirm mathematical laws using inductive reasoning. 
Galileo showed a modern appreciation for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. 
He understood the parabola, both in terms of conic sections and in terms of the ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x). 
Galileo further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of air resistance or other disturbances. 
He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola,[125][126][127] but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight.[125][128][129] 
Galileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632), which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated him and the Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until this point.[9] He was tried by the Inquisition, found "vehemently suspect of heresy", and forced to recant. 
He spent the rest of his life under house arrest.[12][13] While under house arrest, he wrote Two New Sciences, in which he summarized work he had done some forty years earlier on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials.[14][15]

Cannabis in South Africa has been decriminalised by the country's Constitutional Court for personal consumption by adults in private.[1] However, laws prohibiting use outside of one's private dwelling and buying and selling cannabis still remain.[2] Since regulations against the purchase of products containing cannabis still remain in effect, it also remains unclear how the ruling can be enforced as well.[2] 
Before prohibition against the plant was lifted in 2018 advocates pressured the government to modify its laws, which first restricted cannabis in 1922, to allow exemptions for medical use, religious practices, and other purposes. 
Dagga (Afrikaans pronunciation: [/ˈdaχa/]), is the Afrikaans term commonly referred to for cannabis; it derives from the Khoikhoi word dacha, which was used by the early European colonial settlers in the Western Cape.[3] 
Cannabis is thought to have been introduced to Africa by early Arab or Indian traders. 
[1] It was already in popular use in South Africa by the indigenous[4] Khoisan and Bantu peoples prior to European settlement in the Cape in 1652, and was traditionally used by Basotho to ease childbirth.[5] According to author Hazel Crampton, old Afrikaner recipes for teas and foods exist which make use of the plant.[6] Use of the plant was associated with traditional African populations and a lower economic status.[3][5] 
In object-oriented computer programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable. 
It is not related to the GRASP software design principles. 
The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin.[1][2][3] Though they apply to any object-oriented design, the SOLID principles can also form a core philosophy for methodologies such as agile development or adaptive software development.[3] The theory of SOLID principles was introduced by Martin in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns,[2][4] although the SOLID acronym was introduced later by Michael Feathers.[5] 
Single-responsibility principle[6] A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class. 
Open–closed principle[7] "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification." 
Liskov substitution principle[8] "Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." 
See also design by contract. 
Interface segregation principle[9] "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."[5] Dependency inversion principle[10] One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."[4] 
In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. 
It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. 
Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. 
Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system. 
Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. 
Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for functional programming languages, some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for non-object-oriented languages. 
By definition, a pattern must be programmed anew into each application that uses it. 
Since some authors see this as a step backward from software reuse as provided by components, researchers have worked to turn patterns into components. 
Meyer and Arnout were able to provide full or partial componentization of two-thirds of the patterns they attempted.[5] 
Design patterns are composed of several sections (see § Documentation below). 
Of particular interest are the Structure, Participants, and Collaboration sections. 
These sections describe a design motif: a prototypical micro-architecture that developers copy and adapt to their particular designs to solve the recurrent problem described by the design pattern. 
A micro-architecture is a set of program constituents (e.g., classes, methods...) and their relationships. 
Developers use the design pattern by introducing in their designs this prototypical micro-architecture, which means that micro-architectures in their designs will have structure and organization similar to the chosen design motif. 
Design patterns are categorized into 3 sub-classifications based on kind of problem they solve. 
Creational patterns provide the capability to create objects based on a required criteria and in a controlled way. 
Structural patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. 
Finally, behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. 
Name Description In Design Patterns In Code Complete[13] Other Abstract factory Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. 
Yes Yes N/A Builder Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations. 
Yes No N/A Dependency Injection A class accepts the objects it requires from an injector instead of creating the objects directly. 
No No N/A Factory method Define an interface for creating a single object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses. 
Yes Yes N/A Lazy initialization Tactic of delaying the creation of an object, the calculation of a value, or some other expensive process until the first time it is needed. 
This pattern appears in the GoF catalog as "virtual proxy", an implementation strategy for the Proxy pattern. 
No No PoEAA[14] Multiton Ensure a class has only named instances, and provide a global point of access to them. 
No No N/A Object pool Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use. 
Can be considered a generalisation of connection pool and thread pool patterns. 
No No N/A Prototype Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects from the 'skeleton' of an existing object, thus boosting performance and keeping memory footprints to a minimum. 
Yes No N/A Resource acquisition is initialization (RAII) Ensure that resources are properly released by tying them to the lifespan of suitable objects. 
No No N/A Singleton Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it. 
Yes Yes N/A 
Name Description In Design Patterns In Code Complete[1] Other Adapter, Wrapper, or Translator Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. 
An adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. 
The enterprise integration pattern equivalent is the translator. 
Yes Yes N/A Bridge Decouple an abstraction from its implementation allowing the two to vary independently. 
Yes Yes N/A Composite Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. 
Yes Yes N/A Decorator Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically keeping the same interface. 
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. 
Yes Yes N/A Extension object Adding functionality to a hierarchy without changing the hierarchy. 
No No Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices[15] Facade Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. 
Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. 
Yes Yes N/A Flyweight Use sharing to support large numbers of similar objects efficiently. 
Yes No N/A Front controller The pattern relates to the design of Web applications. 
It provides a centralized entry point for handling requests. 
No No J2EE Patterns[16] PoEAA[17] Marker Empty interface to associate metadata with a class. 
No No Effective Java[18] Module Group several related elements, such as classes, singletons, methods, globally used, into a single conceptual entity. 
No No N/A Proxy Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. 
Yes No N/A Twin [19] Twin allows modeling of multiple inheritance in programming languages that do not support this feature. 
Name Description In POSA2[20] Other Active Object Decouples method execution from method invocation that reside in their own thread of control. 
The goal is to introduce concurrency, by using asynchronous method invocation and a scheduler for handling requests. 
Yes N/A Balking Only execute an action on an object when the object is in a particular state. 
No N/A Binding properties Combining multiple observers to force properties in different objects to be synchronized or coordinated in some way.[21] No N/A Compute kernel The same calculation many times in parallel, differing by integer parameters used with non-branching pointer math into shared arrays, such as GPU-optimized Matrix multiplication or Convolutional neural network. 
No N/A Double-checked locking Reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first testing the locking criterion (the 'lock hint') in an unsafe manner; only if that succeeds does the actual locking logic proceed. 
Can be unsafe when implemented in some language/hardware combinations. 
It can therefore sometimes be considered an anti-pattern. 
Yes N/A Event-based asynchronous Addresses problems with the asynchronous pattern that occur in multithreaded programs.[22] No N/A Guarded suspension Manages operations that require both a lock to be acquired and a precondition to be satisfied before the operation can be executed. 
No N/A Join Join-pattern provides a way to write concurrent, parallel and distributed programs by message passing. 
Compared to the use of threads and locks, this is a high-level programming model. 
No N/A Lock One thread puts a "lock" on a resource, preventing other threads from accessing or modifying it.[23] No PoEAA[14] Messaging design pattern (MDP) Allows the interchange of information (i.e. messages) between components and applications. 
No N/A Monitor object An object whose methods are subject to mutual exclusion, thus preventing multiple objects from erroneously trying to use it at the same time. 
Yes N/A Reactor A reactor object provides an asynchronous interface to resources that must be handled synchronously. 
Yes N/A Read-write lock Allows concurrent read access to an object, but requires exclusive access for write operations. 
No N/A Scheduler Explicitly control when threads may execute single-threaded code. 
No N/A Thread pool A number of threads are created to perform a number of tasks, which are usually organized in a queue. 
Typically, there are many more tasks than threads. 
Can be considered a special case of the object pool pattern. 
No N/A Thread-specific storage Static or "global" memory local to a thread.

Patterns originated as an architectural concept by Christopher Alexander as early as 1966 (c.f. "The Pattern of Streets," JOURNAL OF THE AIP, September, 1966, Vol. 
32, No. 3, pp. 273-278). 
In 1987, Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham began experimenting with the idea of applying patterns to programming – specifically pattern languages – and presented their results at the OOPSLA conference that year.[1][2] In the following years, Beck, Cunningham and others followed up on this work. 
Practice 
Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.[4] Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. 
Freshly written code can often have hidden subtle issues that take time to be detected, issues that sometimes can cause major problems down the road. 
Reusing design patterns helps to prevent such subtle issues[citation needed], and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns. 
Cognitive hearing science is an interdisciplinary science field concerned with the physiological and cognitive basis of hearing and its interplay with signal processing in hearing aids. 
The field includes genetics, physiology, medical and technical audiology, cognitive neuroscience, cognitive psychology, linguistics and social psychology. 
Theoretically the research in cognitive hearing science combines a physiological model for the information transfer from the outer auditory organ to the auditory cerebral cortex, and a cognitive model for how language comprehension is influenced by the interplay between the incoming language signal and the individual's cognitive skills, especially the long-term memory and the working memory.[1] 
Researchers examine the interplay between type of hearing impairment or deafness, type of signal processing in different hearing aids, type of listening environment and the individual's cognitive skills. 
Research in cognitive hearing science has importance for the knowledge about different types of hearing impairment and its effects, as for the possibilities to determine which individuals can make use of certain type of signal processing in hearing aid or cochlear implant and thereby adapt hearing aid to the individual.[2] 
Cognitive hearing science has been introduced by researchers at the Linköping University research centre Linnaeus Centre HEAD (HEaring And Deafness) in Sweden, created in 2008 with a major 10-year grant from the Swedish Research Council. 
In database design, object-oriented programming and design (see object oriented program architecture), has-a (has_a or has a) is a composition relationship where one object (often called the constituted object, or part/constituent/member object) "belongs to" (is part or member of) another object (called the composite type), and behaves according to the rules of ownership. 
In simple words, has-a relationship in an object is called a member field of an object. 
Multiple has-a relationships will combine to form a possessive hierarchy. 
Wangarĩ Muta Maathai (/wænˈɡɑːri mɑːˈtaɪ/; 1 April 1940 – 25 September 2011) was a renowned Kenyan social, environmental and political activist and the first African woman to win the Nobel Prize.[1] She earned a Bachelor's Degree in the United States at Mount St. Scholastica (Benedictine College), her Master's Degree at the University of Pittsburgh, and went on to become the first woman in East and Central Africa to earn a PhD, at the University of Nairobi in Kenya. 
An oil painting of a chemist (by Henrika Šantel in 1932) 
Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with elements and compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances.[1][2][3][4] 
In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology.[5] It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level.[6] For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).

The Wayback Machine is a digital archive of the World Wide Web. 
It was founded by the Internet Archive, a nonprofit library based in San Francisco, California. 
Created in 1996 and launched to the public in 2001, it allows the user to go "back in time" and see how websites looked in the past. 
Its founders, Brewster Kahle and Bruce Gilliat, developed the Wayback Machine with the intention of providing "universal access to all knowledge" by preserving archived copies of defunct webpages. 
Since its creation in 1996, over 544 billion pages have been added to the archive. 
The service has also sparked controversy over whether creating archived pages without the owner's permission constitutes copyright infringement in certain jurisdictions.

Human sperm stained for semen quality testing 
Sperm is the male reproductive cell, or gamete, in anisogamous forms of sexual reproduction (forms in which there is a larger, "female" reproductive cell and a smaller, "male" one). Animals produce motile sperm with a tail known as a flagellum, which are known as spermatozoa, while some red algae and fungi produce non-motile sperm cells, known as spermatia.[1] Flowering plants contain non-motile sperm inside pollen, while some more basal plants like ferns and some gymnosperms have motile sperm.[2]

Sophia is conceptually similar to the computer program ELIZA, which was one of the first attempts at simulating a human conversation.[22] The software has been programmed to give pre-written responses to specific questions or phrases, like a chatbot. 
These responses are used to create the illusion that the robot is able to understand conversation, including stock answers to questions like "Is the door open or shut?"[23] In 2017 Hanson Robotics announced plans to open Sophia to a cloud environment using a decentralized blockchain marketplace.[24][25] 
David Hanson has said that Sophia would ultimately be a good fit to serve in healthcare, customer service, therapy and education.[26] In 2019 Sophia displayed the ability to create drawings, including portraits.[27] 
On November 21, 2017, Sophia was named the United Nations Development Programme's first-ever Innovation Champion for Asia and the Pacific.[1] The announcement was made at the Responsible Business Forum in Singapore, an event hosted by the UNDP in Asia and the Pacific and Global Initiatives. 
As part of her role, Sophia will help to unlock innovation to work toward achieving the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. 
On stage, she was assigned her first task by UNDP Asia Pacific Chief of Policy and Program, Jaco Cilliers.[28] 
Sophia has appeared on CBS 60 Minutes with Charlie Rose,[29] Good Morning Britain with Piers Morgan,[30] and outlets like CNBC, Forbes, Mashable, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Guardian, and the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. 
Sophia was featured in AUDI's annual report[31] and was on the cover of ELLE Brasil magazine.[32] Sophia has also appeared in videos and music videos, including The White King, and as the lead female character in pop singer Leehom Wang’s music video A.I.[33] 
A Sophia lookalike was portrayed by drag queen Gigi Goode in the "Snatch Game" episode of the twelfth season of RuPaul’s Drag Race. 
Goode won the episode with her character "Maria the Robot", based heavily on Sophia and named after a robot featured in the Fritz Lang film Metropolis.[34][35] 
Sophia is a social humanoid robot developed by Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics.[1] Sophia was activated on February 14, 2016,[2] and made her first public appearance at South by Southwest Festival (SXSW) in mid-March 2016 in Austin, Texas, United States.[3] 
Sophia has been covered by media around the globe and has participated in many high-profile interviews. 
In October 2017, Sophia "became" a Saudi Arabian citizen, the first robot to receive citizenship of any country.[1][5] In November 2017, Sophia was named the United Nations Development Programme's first ever Innovation Champion, and is the first non-human to be given any United Nation title.[6] 
Sophia was first activated on February 14, 2016.[7][8] The robot, modeled after the ancient Egyptian Queen Nefertiti,[9] Audrey Hepburn, and her inventor's wife, Amanda Hanson,[4][10] is known for human-like appearance and behavior compared to previous robotic variants. 
As of 2018, Sophia's architecture includes scripting software, a chat system, and OpenCog, an AI system designed for general reasoning.[11] Sophia imitates human gestures and facial expressions and is able to answer certain questions and to make simple conversations on predefined topics (e.g. on the weather).[12] Sophia uses speech recognition technology from Alphabet Inc. (parent company of Google) and is "designed to get smarter over time". 
Her speech synthesis ability is provided by Cereproc's Text-to-Speech engine and also allows her to sing. 
Sophia's intelligence software is designed by Hanson Robotics.[13][14] The AI program analyses conversations and extracts data that allows it to improve responses in the future.[15] 
Hanson designed Sophia to be a suitable companion for the elderly at nursing homes, or to help crowds at large events or parks. 
He has said that he hopes that the robot can ultimately interact with other humans sufficiently to gain social skills.[4] Sophia is marketed as a "social robot" that can mimic social behavior and induce feelings of love in humans.[2][16] 
Sophia has at least nine robot humanoid "siblings" who were also created by Hanson Robotics.[17] Fellow Hanson robots are Alice, Albert Einstein Hubo, BINA48, Han, Jules, Professor Einstein, Philip K. Dick Android, Zeno,[17] and Joey Chaos.[18] Around 2019–20, Hanson released "Little Sophia" as a companion that could teach children how to code, including support for Python, Blockly, and Raspberry Pi.[19] 
Scandal! (formerly The Voice) is a South African soap opera produced by Ochre Moving Pictures and broadcast on e.tv. 
It is one of the most watched soapies in South Africa, contending with SABC 1's longest-running soapie Generations: The Legacy.[1][2] It is also broadcast across Africa on the eAfrica, e.tv Botswana and e.tv Ghana feeds. 
Forms 
Polygyny, wherein a man has multiple simultaneous wives Polyandry, wherein a woman has multiple simultaneous husbands Group marriage, wherein the family unit consists of multiple husbands and multiple wives of legal age 
Polygyny 
Polygyny, the practice wherein a man has more than one wife at the same time, is by far the most common form of polygamy. 
Many[quantify] Muslim-majority countries and some countries with sizable Muslim minorities accept polygyny to varying extents both legally and culturally; some secular countries like India also accept it to varying degrees. 
Islamic law or sharia is a religious law forming part of the Islamic tradition which allows polygyny.[13][14] It is derived from the religious precepts of Islam, particularly the Quran and the hadith. 
In Arabic, the term sharīʿah refers to God's (Arabic: الله Allāh) immutable divine law and is contrasted with fiqh, which refers to its human scholarly interpretations.[15][16][17] 
Polygyny is more widespread in Africa than on any other continent,[18][19] especially in West Africa, and some scholars see the slave trade's impact on the male-to-female sex ratio as a key factor in the emergence and fortification of polygynous practices in regions of Africa.[20] 
Anthropologist Jack Goody's comparative study of marriage around the world utilizing the Ethnographic Atlas demonstrated a historical correlation between the practice of extensive shifting horticulture and polygamy in the majority of sub-Saharan African societies.[21] Drawing on the work of Ester Boserup, Goody notes that the sexual division of labour varies between the male-dominated intensive plough-agriculture common in Eurasia and the extensive shifting horticulture found in sub-Saharan Africa. 
In some of the sparsely-populated regions where shifting cultivation takes place in Africa, women do much of the work. 
This favours polygamous marriages in which men seek to monopolize the production of women "who are valued both as workers and as child bearers". 
Goody however, observes that the correlation is imperfect and varied, and also discusses more traditionally male-dominated though relatively extensive farming systems such as those that exist in much of West Africa, especially in the West African savanna, where more agricultural work is done by men, and where polygyny is desired by men more for the generation of male offspring whose labor is valued.[22] 
Polygynous marriages fall into two types: sororal polygyny, in which the co-wives are sisters, and non-sororal, where the co-wives are not related. 
Polygyny offers husbands the benefit of allowing them to have more children, may provide them with a larger number of productive workers (where workers are family), and allows them to establish politically useful ties with a greater number of kin groups.[1] Senior wives can benefit as well when the addition of junior wives to the family lightens their workload. 
Wives', especially senior wives', status in a community can increase through the addition of other wives, who add to the family's prosperity or symbolize conspicuous consumption (much as a large house, domestic help, or expensive vacations operate in a western country). 
For such reasons, senior wives sometimes work hard or contribute from their own resources to enable their husbands to accumulate the bride price for an extra wife.[26] 
Polygyny may also result from the practice of levirate marriage. 
In such cases, the deceased man's heir may inherit his assets and wife; or, more usually, his brothers may marry the widow. This provides support for the widow and her children (usually also members of the brothers' kin group) and maintains the tie between the husbands' and wives' kin groups. 
The sororate resembles the levirate, in that a widower must marry the sister of his dead wife. 
The family of the late wife, in other words, must provide a replacement for her, thus maintaining the marriage alliance. 
Both levirate and sororate may result in a man having multiple wives.[1] 
In monogamous societies, wealthy and powerful men established enduring relationships with, and established separate household for, multiple female partners, aside from their legitimate wives; a practice accepted in Imperial China up until the Qing Dynasty of 1636–1912. 
This constitutes a form of de facto polygyny referred to as concubinage.[27] 
Marriage is the moment at which a new household is formed, but different arrangements may occur depending upon the type of marriage and some polygamous marriages do not result in the formation of a single household. 
In many polygynous marriages the husband's wives may live in separate households.[28] They can thus be described as a "series of linked nuclear families with a 'father' in common".[29] 
Polyandry is believed to be more common in societies with scarce environmental resources, as it is believed to limit human population growth and enhance child survival.[31] It is a rare form of marriage that exists not only among poor families, but also the elite.[32] For example, in the Himalayan Mountains polyandry is related to the scarcity of land; the marriage of all brothers in a family to the same wife allows family land to remain intact and undivided.[33] If every brother married separately and had children, family land would be split into unsustainable small plots. 
In Europe, this outcome was avoided through the social practice of impartible inheritance, under which most siblings would be disinherited.[34] 
Polygamy (from Late Greek πολυγαμία, polygamía, "state of marriage to many spouses"[1][2][3][4]) is the practice of marrying multiple spouses. 
When a man is married to more than one wife at the same time, sociologists call this polygyny. When a woman is married to more than one husband at a time, it is called polyandry. 
Serial monogamy refers to remarriage after divorce or death of a spouse from a monogamous marriage, i.e. multiple marriages but only one legal spouse at a time (a series of monogamous relationships).[38] 
According to Danish scholar Miriam K. Zeitzen, anthropologists treat serial monogamy, in which divorce and remarriage occur, as a form of polygamy as it also can establish a series of households that may continue to be tied by shared paternity and shared income.[25] As such, they are similar to the household formations created through divorce and serial monogamy.[39] 
Serial monogamy creates a new kind of relative, the "ex-".[40] The "ex-wife", for example, can remain an active part of her "ex-husband's" life, as they may be tied together by legally or informally mandated economic support, which can last for years, including by alimony, child support, and joint custody. 
Bob Simpson, the British social anthropologist, notes that it creates an "extended family" by tying together a number of households, including mobile children. He says that Britons may have ex‑wives or ex‑brothers‑in‑law, but not an ex‑child. 
According to him, these "unclear families" do not fit the mold of the monogamous nuclear family.[41] 
Group marriage is a non-monogamous marriage-like arrangement where three or more adults live together, all considering themselves partners, sharing finances, children, and household responsibilities. 
Polyamory is on a continuum of family-bonds that includes group marriage.[42] The term does not refer to bigamy as no claim to being married in formal legal terms is made.[43] 
Buddhism does not regard marriage as a sacrament; it is purely a secular affair, and normally Buddhist monks do not participate in it (though in some sects priests and monks do marry). 
Hence marriage receives no religious sanction.[44] Forms of marriage, in consequence, vary from country to country. 
The Parabhava Sutta states that "a man who is not satisfied with one woman and seeks out other women is on the path to decline". 
Other fragments in the Buddhist scripture seem to treat polygamy unfavorably, leading some authors to conclude that Buddhism generally does not approve of it[45] or alternatively regards it as a tolerated, but subordinate, marital model.[46] 
Thailand legally recognized polygamy until 1955. 
Myanmar outlawed polygyny from 2015. 
In Sri Lanka, polyandry was legal in the kingdom of Kandy, but outlawed by British after conquering the kingdom in 1815.[1] When the Buddhist texts were translated into Chinese, the concubines of others were added to the list of inappropriate partners. 
Polyandry in Tibet was common traditionally,[clarification needed] as was polygyny, and having several wives or husbands was never regarded[by whom?] as having sex with inappropriate partners.[47] Most typically, fraternal polyandry is practiced, but sometimes father and son have a common wife, which is a unique family structure in the world. 
Other forms of marriage are also present, like group marriage and monogamous marriage.[3] Polyandry (especially fraternal polyandry) is also common among Buddhists in Bhutan, Ladakh, and other parts of the Indian subcontinent. 
Some pre-Christian Celtic pagans were known to practice polygamy, although the Celtic peoples wavered between it, monogamy and polyandry depending on the time period and area.[48] In some areas this continued even after Christianization began, for instance the Brehon Laws of Gaelic Ireland explicitly allowed for polygamy,[49][50] especially amongst the noble class.[51] Some modern Celtic pagan religions accept the practice of polygamy to varying degrees,[52] though how widespread the practice is within these religions is unknown. 
Although the Old Testament describes numerous examples of polygamy among devotees to God, most Christian groups have historically rejected the practice of polygamy and have upheld monogamy alone as normative. 
Nevertheless, some Christians groups in different periods have practiced, or currently do practice, polygamy.[53][54] Some Christians actively debate whether the New Testament or Christian ethics allows or forbids polygamy. 
Although the New Testament is largely silent on polygamy, some point to Jesus's repetition of the earlier scriptures, noting that a man and a wife "shall become one flesh".[55] However, some look to Paul's writings to the Corinthians: "Do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? 
For, as it is written, 'The two will become one flesh.'" 
Supporters of polygamy claim this indicates that the term refers to a physical, rather than spiritual,[clarification needed] union.[56] 
Worldwide, different societies variously encourage, accept or outlaw polygamy. 
In societies which allow or tolerate polygamy, in the vast majority of cases the form accepted is polygyny. 
According to the Ethnographic Atlas Codebook (1998), of 1,231 societies noted, 588 had frequent polygyny, 453 had occasional polygyny, 186 were monogamous and 4 had polyandry[5] – although more recent research suggests that polyandry may occur more commonly than previously thought.[6] In cultures which practice polygamy, its prevalence among that population often correlates with class and socioeconomic status.[7] 
As tribal populations grew, fertility was no longer a valid justification of polygamy: it "was lawful among the ancient fathers: whether it be lawful now also, I would not hastily pronounce (utrum et nunc fas sit, non temere dixerim). For there is not now necessity of begetting children, as there then was, when, even when wives bear children, it was allowed, in order to a more numerous posterity, to marry other wives in addition, which now is certainly not lawful."[65] 
In modern times a minority of Roman Catholic theologians have argued that polygamy, though not ideal, can be a legitimate form of Christian marriage in certain regions, in particular Africa.[71][72] The Roman Catholic Church teaches in its Catechism that 
The illegality of polygamy in certain areas creates, according to certain Bible passages, additional arguments against it. 
Paul the Apostle writes "submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience" (Romans 13:5), for "the authorities that exist have been established by God." 
(Romans 13:1) St Peter concurs when he says to "submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right." (1 Peter 2:13,14) Pro-polygamists argue that, as long as polygamists currently do not obtain legal marriage licenses nor seek "common law marriage status" for additional spouses, no enforced laws are being broken any more than when monogamous couples similarly co-habitate without a marriage license.[74] 
The Lutheran World Federation hosted a regional conference in Africa, in which the acceptance of polygamists into full membership by the Lutheran Church in Liberia was defended as being permissible.[75] The Lutheran Church in Liberia, however, does not permit polygamists who have become Christians to marry more wives after they have received the sacrament of Holy Baptism.[76] Evangelical Lutheran missionaries in Maasai also tolerate the practice of polygamy and in Southern Sudan, some polygamists are becoming Lutheran Christians.[77] 
After Joseph Smith was killed by a mob on 27 June 1844, the main body of Latter Day Saints left Nauvoo and followed Brigham Young to Utah where the practice of plural marriage continued.[85] In 1852, Brigham Young, the second president of the LDS Church, publicly acknowledged the practice of plural marriage through a sermon he gave. 
Additional sermons by top Mormon leaders on the virtues of polygamy followed.[86]:128 Controversy followed when polygamy became a social cause, writers began to publish works condemning polygamy. 
The key plank of the Republican Party's 1856 platform was "to prohibit in the territories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery".[87] In 1862, Congress issued the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act which clarified that the practice of polygamy was illegal in all US territories. 
The LDS Church believed that their religiously based practice of plural marriage was protected by the United States Constitution,[88] however, the unanimous 1878 Supreme Court decision Reynolds v. United States declared that polygamy was not protected by the Constitution, based on the longstanding legal principle that "laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinions, they may with practices."[89] 
The Rig Veda mentions that during the Vedic period, a man could have more than one wife.[103] The practice is attested in epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata. 
The Dharmashastras permit a man to marry women provided that the first wife agree to marry him. 
Despite its existence, it was most usually practiced by men of higher status. 
Common people were only allowed a second marriage if the first wife could not bear a son or have some dispute because there is no law for divorce in Hinduism.[104] 
Simone Arianne Biles (born March 14, 1997)[4] is an American artistic gymnast. 
With a combined total of 30 Olympic and World Championship medals, Biles is the most decorated American gymnast and is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most dominant female gymnasts of all time.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12] 
At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Biles won individual gold medals in all-around, vault and floor; bronze in balance beam; and gold as part of the United States team, dubbed the "Final Five".[13] Biles is also a five-time World all-around champion (2013–2015, 2018–19), five-time World floor exercise champion (2013–2015, 2018–19), three-time World balance beam champion (2014–15, 2019), two-time World vault champion (2018–19), a seven-time United States national all-around champion (2013–2016, 2018–19, 2021), and a member of the gold medal-winning American teams at the 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. 
Additionally, she is a three-time World silver medalist (2013 and 2014 on vault, 2018 on uneven bars) and a three-time World bronze medalist (2015 on vault, 2013 and 2018 on balance beam). 
Biles is the gymnast with the most World medals (25) and most World gold medals (19), having surpassed Scherbo's record 23 World medals by winning her 24th and 25th, both gold, at the 2019 competition in Stuttgart.[14] She is the female gymnast with the most World all-around titles (5). 
Biles is the sixth woman to win an individual all-around title at both the World Championships and the Olympics, and the first gymnast since Lilia Podkopayeva in 1996 to hold both titles simultaneously. 
She is the tenth female gymnast and first American female gymnast to win a World medal on every event, and the first female gymnast since Daniela Silivaș in 1988 to win a medal on every event at a single Olympic Games or World Championships, having accomplished this feat at the 2018 World Championships in Doha.[15] 
Anal sex or anal intercourse is generally the insertion and thrusting of the erect penis into a person's anus, or anus and rectum, for sexual pleasure.[1][2][3] Other forms of anal sex include fingering, the use of sex toys for anal penetration, oral sex performed on the anus (anilingus), and pegging.[4][5] Although anal sex most commonly means penile–anal penetration,[3][4][6] sources sometimes use anal intercourse to exclusively denote penile–anal penetration, and anal sex to denote any form of anal sexual activity, especially between pairings as opposed to anal masturbation.[6][7] 
As with most forms of sexual activity, anal sex participants risk contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs). 
Anal sex is considered a high-risk sexual practice because of the vulnerability of the anus and rectum. 
The anal and rectal tissues are delicate and do not provide lubrication like the vagina does, so they can easily tear and permit disease transmission, especially if a personal lubricant is not used.[1][2][14] Anal sex without protection of a condom is considered the riskiest form of sexual activity,[14][15][16] and therefore health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend safe sex practices for anal sex.[17] 
Strong views are often expressed about anal sex. 
It is controversial in various cultures, especially with regard to religious prohibitions. 
This is commonly due to prohibitions against anal sex among males or teachings about the procreative purpose of sexual activity.[1][2] It may be considered taboo or unnatural, and is a criminal offense in some countries, punishable by corporal or capital punishment.[5][7] By contrast, anal sex may also be considered a natural and valid form of sexual activity as fulfilling as other desired sexual expressions, and can be an enhancing or primary element of a person's sex life.[5][7] 
The abundance of nerve endings in the anal region and rectum can make anal sex pleasurable for men or women.[1][2][3] The internal and external sphincter muscles control the opening and closing of the anus; these muscles, which are sensitive membranes made up of many nerve endings, facilitate pleasure or pain during anal sex.[2][5] Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia states that "the inner third of the anal canal is less sensitive to touch than the outer two-thirds, but is more sensitive to pressure" and that "the rectum is a curved tube about eight or nine inches long and has the capacity, like the anus, to expand".[5] 
While anal sex is commonly associated with male homosexuality, research shows that not all gay men engage in anal sex and that it is not uncommon in heterosexual relationships.[1][8][9] Types of anal sex can also be a part of lesbian sexual practices.[10] People may experience pleasure from anal sex by stimulation of the anal nerve endings, and orgasm may be achieved through anal penetration – by indirect stimulation of the prostate in men, indirect stimulation of the clitoris or an area of the vagina (sometimes called the G-spot) in women, and other sensory nerves (especially the pudendal nerve).[2][5][11] However, people may also find anal sex painful, sometimes extremely so,[12][13] which may be due to psychological factors in some cases.[13] 
Mormon pornography is a subgenre of pornography themed around the Mormon religion. 
According to the journalist Isha Aran, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) views Mormon pornography as blasphemous, and most directors and performers in Mormon pornography are ex-Mormons.[1] Mormon pornography typically depicts sex acts between actors and/or actresses portraying members of the LDS Church. 
Mormon elders are depicted as domineering over their multiple wives, who obediently submit to their husband's commands, treating participation in the act as a sacred duty. 
Performers may be (initially) dressed in Mormon underwear, and the setting may be the inside of a Mormon temple. In accordance with stereotyped Mormon norms, profane language is absent.[1] 
Aran writes that the genre originated in 2010 with the launch of the gay pornography site MormonBoyz.com.[1] Website founder Legrand Wolf claims to have graduated from Brigham Young University with a doctoral degree,[2] as well as being an ex-Mormon.[3] The site MormonGirlz.com, launched in 2014, by a woman known in the industry as Brooke Hunter, a 33-year-old ex-Mormon, features both heterosexual and lesbian relationships between Mormon characters.[1] 
People who identify themselves as very religious and consume porn are more likely to consider themselves as addicted to porn (an addiction that is not recognized in the psychiatric handbook DSM-5) than a non-religious reference group according to a 2013 study, but no connection between level of religious devotion and amount of porn consumed was shown in that study.[2] 
There is no direct prohibition of pornography in the Bible. However, many Christians base their views on pornography on Matthew 5:27–28 (part of the Expounding of the Law): 
It contains one of the Ten Commandments, Exodus 20:14 or Deuteronomy 5:18, which is also used often as a supporting verse to condemn pornography.[1][2][3][15] 
Michael Coogan reports that, based on his past experience, the campaign against lustful thoughts had the consequence of razoring the Song of Songs from the Bibles available for seminarians.[1] 
Ken Stone cites Origen's words to say that reading the Song of Songs may stimulate lust to 'fleshly' readers: "But if any man who lives only after the flesh shall approach [the Song of Songs], to such a one the reading of this Scripture will be the occasion of no small hazard and danger. 
For he, not knowing how to hear love's language in purity and with chaste ears, will twist the whole manner of his hearing of it away from the inner spiritual man and on to the outward and carnal; and he will be turned away from the spirit to the flesh, and will foster carnal desires in himself, and it will seem to be the Divine Scriptures that are thus urging and egging him on to fleshly lust!" 
Stone adds that "the heavy use of food imagery in the book is no barrier to a positive 'pornographic' interpretation."[16] 
Richard Hess explains Carey E. Walsh's view as: "Walsh has determined that the emphasis of the Song lies in the expression of desire between two lovers. It is not sexual consummation that is most important, but the desire itself that drives the lovers together. 
In this she distinguishes erotica from pornography. 
The latter is concerned only with sex, and in this it is qualitatively different from the Song. Here sex plays a secondary role to desire. 
Whether there is any sexual activity at all in the poem—and as a fantasy there may be no such reality here—the key to the Song remains with the desire that drives the reader to appreciate the time of waiting. 
Hebrew experience placed the greatest value on passion."[17] Saying that the Song of Songs is "erotica", not pornography, she argues that both are different in at least three ways: (1) Erotica inclines toward "emotions and internal worlds" of a subject to seek empathy, while pornography's "emotional flatness" aims at sexual gratification; (2) Erotica focuses on yearning to reach "consummation", which may occur in "tortuous delay", while pornography is only about the "acts" to reach it as soon as possible and "a frenzy of repetition"; (3) Erotica uses imagination as the "invisible and ever-active participant" without revealing the "mystery of love", while pornography is no more than an explicit story of sexual intercourse.[18] 
Cardinal Karol Wojtyla, before he became Pope John Paul II, wrote in Love and Responsibility: "Pornography is a marked tendency to accentuate the sexual element when reproducing the human body or human love in a work of art, with the object of inducing the reader or viewer to believe that sexual values are the only real values of the person, and that love is nothing more than the experience, individual or shared, of those values alone." Edward Sri explains about the topic of art and pornography, which is discussed in the book by contrasting Michelangelo's works with Playboy, by saying that "good art leads us to a peaceful contemplation of the true, the good and the beautiful, including the truth, goodness and beauty of the human body", while pornography "stirs in us a sensuous craving for the body of another person as an object to be exploited for our own pleasure" and, if it is left uncontrolled, "we will become enslaved to everything that stimulates our sensual desire".[20] When one constantly views pornography, which is focused merely on "the visible and the erotic", and reduces the human person to what is visible with the eyes, he or she will have difficulties relating to people of different gender in real life, since he or she would have become accustomed to seeing them as "objects to be used".[21] 
In a series of lectures called the Theology of the Body, Pope John Paul II argues that some works of art depict naked individuals without evoking lust, but "makes it possible to concentrate, in a way, on the whole truth of man, and the dignity and beauty—also the 'suprasensual' beauty—of his masculinity and feminity", and that such works "bear within them, almost hidden, an element of sublimation". 
He insists that pornography is problematic since "it fails to portray everything that is human".[22] 
Eastern Orthodox Church forbids pornography along with premarital sex. 
Looking lustfully is equal to adultery by Christ's teaching, and linked to prostitution too.[23][24][25] 
Harry Reid notes that, during the Reformation, "Calvin's aim was straightforward, if ambitious; he wanted to create a perfect Christian community where everyone looked after everyone else... 
He persuaded the council to legislate against adultery, prostitution, pornography, gambling, drunkenness and much else."[26] 
According to Manetsch, the Genevan Consistory regularly censured literature they deemed dangerous for public morals, including pornography.[27] 
Oboler also notes that pornography was censored in Geneva and Puritan New England in order to defend against "ungodly eroticism".[1] 
Max Weber argued that there was a concern that eroticism was a kind of idolatry that went against God's rational regulation of sexuality through marriage alone.[28] 
Martin E. Marty notes that, today, both mainstream and evangelical Protestants remain overwhelmingly opposed to pornography and that you will find "very, very few theological statements that go light on pornography."[29] 
In 1990, the Lutheran Church of Australia condemned pornography by publishing an official position on "X-rated videos".[30] 
Doctor John Kleinig, Lecturer Emeritus at the Australian Lutheran College, argues that, "The regular use of pornography for masturbation is a kind of sexual addiction. 
When Paul speaks about impurity and sexual greed as idolatry in Ephesians 5:3-7 and Colossians 3:5, he accurately describes how it works. 
It begins with sexual impurity, the defilement of our imagination by depictions of sexual intercourse that present naked bodies as idols for us to admire. 
Our fixation on these images arouses disordered desires and make us more and more greedy for sexual satisfaction from things that God has not given to us for our enjoyment. 
Yet they fail to satisfy us and serve only to feed our growing appetite for them... 
Where masturbation is involved... the more ashamed we become, the more secretive we become; the more secretive we become and the more we hide in the darkness, the more vulnerable we become to the accusation and condemnation of Satan... 
You need to be careful that Satan does not distort your perception by making a fool of you and getting you to focus on the wrong thing. 
Nowhere in the Bible is masturbation explicitly forbidden. 
There is good reason for this because the problem does not come from masturbation, which is in itself neither good or bad, but the adulterous sexual fantasies that accompany it, as Christ makes clear in Matthew 5:28. 
That’s the problem spiritually! ... That’s how Satan gets a hold on us through our imagination. If you use pornography to masturbate, you put another woman, an idol that promises heaven and gives you hell, sexually, in the place of your wife. 
It arouses your greed for what you don’t have, greed for what God has not given for you to enjoy, greed that increases as you give in to it. 
The more you indulge it, the more dissatisfied and empty you become."[31][32] 
The Church refuses to invest in any company producing pornography, stating that, "Human dignity is based on the belief that women and men are created in God's image. This results in the mission to protect this dignity against derogatory, denigrating, or degrading portrayals. The analysis of this criterion should not only consider pornographic products, but also the producers of videos depicting violence and likewise computer games glamourizing violence."[33] 
In a statement on the role of the media, the EKD's 1997 synod stated, "According to the churches, public broadcasting plays a vital role in guaranteeing the freedom of opinion and access to a variety of information in Germany. 
Maintaining and strengthening this system, which is "almost unique" in the world, is "imperative", said Bishop Engelhardt... 
In view of its greater freedom in producing programmes, it has "a special obligation to practise voluntary control". Now that "violations of taboos and norms" are constantly increasing, public control and self-regulation of the media must be increased. 
This also applies to the protection of "religious convictions", said Bishop Lehmann. 
First attempts made by German Internet providers to introduce voluntary self-regulation need to be improved. 
Nothing glorifying violence, instigating racial hatred, violating human dignity, glorifying war or pornography must be available on-line..."[34] 
The EKD's 1997 synod also "spoke out for action against child pornography on the Internet. 
All legal methods must be applied to counteract it. 
Additionally, the German government should pursue sharper criminal proceedings against people who traffic in women."[35] 
The United Protestant Church of France (EPUdf) teaches that pornography is a sin. 
According to Pastor Gilles Boucomont, "The Bible does not talk about pornography. 
It says that sexuality is lived properly as part of a commitment, marriage. 
Outside of this context, sexuality is adultery if one is already married or sexual misconduct if one is not yet married. 
Misconduct and adultery break the unity that God wants for the married man and woman (1 Corinthians 6 and 7, Mark 10: 1-12)... 
Watching pornography is not doing a sexual act with anyone, certainly. 
However, Jesus considers that adultery begins in the eye (Matthew 5,28). 
There is also no need for a large dissertation to explain that viewing such films does not favor the formation or continuity of stable couples. 
The second aspect of our problem lies in our responsibility for the people who shoot such films. 
Jesus asks us to love our neighbor as ourselves. 
If we do not think we have to surrender our bodies for money, because that is not God's good will for the human, we can not support this practice."[37] Masturbation is also considered sinful.[38] 
On the topic of non-sexual nudity, the EPUdf teaches, "Sin is what separates me from God or comes from my separation from Him. Therefore, nudity, whether sexual or not, must be considered in the context of relationships with God and others. 
Going to a mixed sauna ... if it's only with my partner, in my opinion, I do not see the problem... 
If it is with other people, it seems to me legitimate to ask questions about the temptation that can arise and the reasons that make me go. If there is already a habit of nudity in the civilization to which I belong, it may also not be of a nature to distract me from God. I think it's the same for the nude."[39] 
The Calvinist Protestant Church of Switzerland also condemns pornography. 
Pastor Jean-Charles Bichet writes, "Pornography... gives a distorted image of sexuality. 
It can cause more problems than it solves... 
And the sad thing about all this is that it gives the opportunity for a juicy trade . 
People who agree to pose for photos or to play X rated scenes have not all chosen to do so. 
By consuming porn, humans are also taking responsibility for this kind of trafficking. 
In this sense, we are sinners because we find ourselves involved in this general problem of society. 
The Bible does not specifically refer to pornography, but it often makes harsh judgments about the exploitation of people and prostitution. 
It reminds us that we are all created in the image of God, that we are little brothers and sisters of Jesus, the Son of God, live in liberated and happy people. 
The Bible constantly reminds us that none of us is a commodity. 
None of us should be treated like a shirt that is thrown away."[40] 
In the 1980s, the liberal Presbyterian Church (USA) produced a report entitled, Pornography: Far from the Song of Songs, which states, "Through words and images, pornography debases God’s intended gifts of love and dignity in human sexuality... we live in an age also marked by the shattering of many norms of behavior and the subsequent loss of moral restraints. 
In such a time pornography has proliferated. 
The task force believes that the church is called to give serious attention to this issue... 
Reflected in the title of this report is the conviction that pornography represents human discord, far from the mutual sexual delight depicted biblically in the Song of Songs. 
Pornography is a striking sign of human brokenness and alienation from God and from one another... 
From the perspective of biblical understanding and the Reformed tradition, pornography represents a vivid expression of human alienation: from the creator God who makes covenants and from one another as covenant partners of God."[41] 
The United Methodist Church teaches that pornography is "about violence, degradation, exploitation, and coercion" and "deplore[s] all forms of commercialization, abuse, and exploitation of sex", and defines pornography as "sexually explicit material that portrays violence, abuse, coercion, domination, humiliation, or degradation for the purpose of arousal. In addition, any sexually explicit material that depicts children is pornographic".[43] The Sexual Ethics Task Force of The United Methodist Church states that "Research shows it [pornography] is not an 'innocent activity.' It is harmful and is generally addictive. 
Persons who are addicted to pornography are physiologically altered, as is their perspective, relationships with parishioners and family, and their perceptions of girls and women."[44] 
The liberal-leaning Uniting Church of Australia also condemns pornography and works in society to address the problem.[45] 
In 1990, Quakers declared, "Since pornographic materials promote and propagate a lifestyle that includes activities which are condemned by God's Word and tempt viewers to commit the sin of lust (Matthew 5:27-28: Romans 13:14; II Peter 2:14, 18-19), Friends therefore are urged to carefully avoid exposure to such materials. Because of our responsibility as Christian citizens (Matthew 5:13; Proverbs 14:34) and in view of the evil, exploitative, and destructive effects of pornography on individuals, families, and our society, Friends are encouraged to prayerfully and boldly oppose the production and distribution of pornographic materials in their local communities, as well as at the state and national levels (Ephesians 5:11)."[46] 
Michael Coogan stated that the Tanakh does not have any specific laws relating to pornography and Judaism has always had a positive attitude to sex.[3] In fact, some commentators note, the Bible itself contains erotica,[4][5] such as the Song of Songs.[3] 
Jerry Falwell has criticized pornography, saying sex is reserved for heterosexual married couples, to be used only in accordance with God's will (more specifically, to both solidify the emotional bonds between the man and his lawfully wedded wife, and to help propagate the human race ["Be fruitful, and multiply."]), and asserts that use of pornography involves indulgence in lust towards people other than one's spouse (which in Christianity is a sin)[49] and leads to an overall increase in sexually immoral behavior (including, for example, adultery, rape, and/or even child molestation). 
William M. Struthers in his book, Wired for Intimacy, has criticized pornography from a scientific viewpoint, suggesting that the viewing and use of pornography embeds abnormal neural pathways in the brain such that the desire for physical sexual relations may become subverted over time.[50] 
The 1998 Lambeth Conference Resolution I.10 states, "... 
Clearly some expressions of sexuality are inherently contrary to the Christian way and are sinful. 
Such unacceptable expression of sexuality include promiscuity, prostitution, incest, pornography, paedophilia, predatory sexual behaviour, and sadomasochism (all of which may be heterosexual and homosexual), adultery, violence against wives, and female circumcision. From a Christian perspective these forms of sexual expression remain sinful in any context. We are particularly concerned about the pressures on young people to engage in sexual activity at an early age, and we urge our Churches to teach the virtue of abstinence."[51] 
The Anglican Diocese of Melbourne published an article which noted that, "Pornography is prostitution, as men pay money, time and dignity for gratification. This payment might not be direct, but the support of pornography feeds the human trafficking industry, in which some 27 million women and children are trapped worldwide. 
The harlot that used to be on the street corner is now our computer."[52] 
The Anglican Diocese of Sydney has established an "Archbishop's Taskforce for Resisting Pornography", which at the end of 2017, was seeking to establish a "resistingporn.org" website. The taskforce chairman has noted, "We know porn can alter desires and can affect self-control and compulsive behaviours. 
Studies have shown that the brains of long-term porn users behave similarly to those of drug addicts. 
There are also other effects... such as increasing incidences of adultery and earlier first-time sexual activity. 
It also goes without saying pornography is incompatible with God’s good purposes for the world."[53] 
Maimonides, in his Mishneh Torah, writes, based on the Talmud,[6] that "A person who stares at even a small finger of a woman with the intent of deriving pleasure is considered as if he looked at her genitalia. 
It is even forbidden to hear the voice of a woman with whom sexual relations are prohibited, or to look at her hair."[7] This is further codified in the Code of Jewish Law,[8] which includes further prohibitions (based on the Talmud) such as "watching women as they do the laundry." 
Accordingly, pornography would be forbidden a fortiori.[citation needed] 
Gordon B. Hinckley, president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1995 to 2008, was known within the faith for expounding his organization's sentiments against pornography.[54] The LDS Church teaches that pornography is "any material depicting or describing the human body or sexual conduct in a way that arouses sexual feelings. 
It is as harmful to the spirit as tobacco, alcohol, and drugs are to the body. 
Members of the Church should avoid pornography in any form and should oppose its production, distribution, and use."[55] 
As part of teaching the law of chastity, LDS Church leaders have repeatedly condemned the use of sexually arousing literature[56] and visual material for decades.[57][58] 
Pornography is directly opposed to the very heart of Islamic teachings, which is highlighted by Taqwa to gain a better self-control.[citation needed] 
The Qur'an 24:31 states "And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and keep covered their private parts, and that they should not show-off their beauty except what is apparent, and let them cast their shawls over their cleavage. 
And let them not show off their beauty except to their husbands... 
"[60] Therefore, it is stated by Islamic scholars that one can only look lustfully at the nakedness or the body of someone who is one's spouse, and if a Muslim sees someone or something that arouses them, including pornography, they should avoid looking at it. Hence, the justification for declaring pornography haram in Islam.[61][62] 
Additionally, Jewish laws of modesty and humility (tzniut) require Jewish men & women to dress modestly.[9] Jewish law thus precludes Jewish men & women from engaging in pornographic modelling or acting, besides other acts of immodesty.[citation needed] 
The Qur'an says what means "They are your garments and you are their garments." (2:187) "The sexual unison between husband and wife is more than seeking a relief from the urge of desire. 
Indeed the prophet taught that it is one of the charities in Islam. 
He said to his companions, enumerating examples of charitable deeds :'And when the one of you makes love (has sex with wife/husband) it is a rewardable charity.'"[63] 
Although there is no direct prohibition of pornography in Sikhism, Sikhs argue that pornographic books and films, prostitution, and lust leads to adultery.[68] Pornography is said to encourage lust (Kaam),[69] which is a concept described as an unhealthy obsession for sex and sexual activity. 
Kaam is classed as one of the 'Five Thieves', personality traits which are heavily discouraged for Sikhs, as they "can build barriers against God in their lives".[70] 
Though there is neither a support, nor discourage of pornography (major or minor), still there are some aspects that strictly discourage the intercourse, especially between extra-material affairs of either married couple or both. However, this topic can also be found in vedas, puranas, etc.[citation needed] 
The report goes on to elaborate how it causes this harm.[47] 
Orgasm (from Greek ὀργασμός, orgasmos; "excitement, swelling"; also sexual climax) is the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual excitement during the sexual response cycle, resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region characterized by sexual pleasure.[1][2] Experienced by males and females, orgasms are controlled by the involuntary or autonomic nervous system. 
They are usually associated with involuntary actions, including muscular spasms in multiple areas of the body, a general euphoric sensation and, frequently, body movements and vocalizations.[2] The period after orgasm (known as the refractory period) is typically a relaxing experience, attributed to the release of the neurohormones oxytocin and prolactin as well as endorphins (or "endogenous morphine").[3] 
Scientific literature focuses on the psychology of female orgasm significantly more than it does on the psychology of male orgasm, which "appears to reflect the assumption that female orgasm is psychologically more complex than male orgasm," but "the limited empirical evidence available suggests that male and female orgasm may bear more similarities than differences. In one controlled study by Vance and Wagner (1976), independent raters could not differentiate written descriptions of male versus female orgasm experiences".[1] 
In men, the most common way of achieving orgasm is by physical sexual stimulation of the penis.[1] This is usually accompanied by ejaculation, but it is possible, though also rare, for men to orgasm without ejaculation (known as a "dry orgasm").[2] Prepubescent boys have dry orgasms.[19] Dry orgasms can also occur as a result of retrograde ejaculation,[20] or hypogonadism.[21] Men may also ejaculate without reaching orgasm,[21][22] which is known as anorgasmic ejaculation.[22] They may also achieve orgasm by stimulation of the prostate (see below).[2][23] 
The traditional view of male orgasm is that there are two stages: emission following orgasm, almost instantly followed by a refractory period. 
The refractory period is the recovery phase after orgasm during which it is physiologically impossible for a man to have additional orgasms.[24][25] In 1966, Masters and Johnson published pivotal research about the phases of sexual stimulation.[10][26] Their work included women and men, and, unlike Alfred Kinsey in 1948 and 1953,[27] tried to determine the physiological stages before and after orgasm. 
Human orgasms usually result from physical sexual stimulation of the penis in males (typically accompanying ejaculation) and of the clitoris in females.[1][4][5] Sexual stimulation can be by self-practice (masturbation) or with a sex partner (penetrative sex, non-penetrative sex, or other sexual activity). 
The health effects surrounding the human orgasm are diverse. 
There are many physiological responses during sexual activity, including a relaxed state created by prolactin, as well as changes in the central nervous system such as a temporary decrease in the metabolic activity of large parts of the cerebral cortex while there is no change or increased metabolic activity in the limbic (i.e., "bordering") areas of the brain.[6] There is also a wide range of sexual dysfunctions, such as anorgasmia. 
These effects affect cultural views of orgasm, such as the beliefs that orgasm and the frequency or consistency of it are either important or irrelevant for satisfaction in a sexual relationship,[7] and theories about the biological and evolutionary functions of orgasm.[8][9] 
In a clinical context, orgasm is usually defined strictly by the muscular contractions involved during sexual activity, along with the characteristic patterns of change in heart rate, blood pressure, and often respiration rate and depth.[1] This is categorized as the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual tension during the sexual response cycle, resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region.[2][3] However, definitions of orgasm vary and there is sentiment that consensus on how to consistently classify it is absent.[11] At least twenty-six definitions of orgasm were listed in the journal Clinical Psychology Review.[12] 
Orgasms can be achieved during a variety of activities, including vaginal, anal or oral sex, non-penetrative sex or masturbation. 
They may also be achieved by the use of a sex toy, such as a sensual vibrator or an erotic electrostimulation. 
Achieving orgasm by stimulation of the nipples or other erogenous zones is rarer.[15][16] Multiple orgasms are also possible, especially in women, but they are also uncommon.[3][17] Multiple orgasms are orgasms that occur within a short period of one another.[17] 
On many occasions church leaders have taught that members should not masturbate as part of obedience to the law of chastity.[13][14][15] Salient examples of this include a church guide to stop masturbating produced in the 1970s.[13][16][17][18] Another is the 1990 edition of the church's youth guidelines pamphlet which stated that the "Lord specifically forbids ... masturbation"[19] with the next two editions (including the most current one) alluding to it with statements forbidding anything that "arouses" any sexual feelings or emotions in one's "own body".[20][21] Apostle Spencer W. Kimball, who later served as church president, warned of the "possible damages" and "dangers"[22] of this "common indescretion"[23] on various occasions calling it a "reprehensible sin"[24][25] that grows "with every exercise".[26][27] The apostle Boyd K. Packer gave a 1976 general conference address "To Young Men Only" warning young men not to tamper with their little factory (a euphemism for their reproductive system) lest it speed up and become a guilt- and depression-inducing habit that is not easy to resist. 
He gave vigorous exercise as a method to help control thoughts and break the habit of masturbation since it is a "transgression" that is "not pleasing to the Lord".[15][28] The talk was printed as a pamphlet and widely distributed by the church from 1980 to 2016.[29] Since 1985 the church has provided a manual for parents to use in discussing sexuality with their children. 
The manual includes statements that "prophets have condemned [masturbation] as a sin" and "perversion of the body's passions" that causes one to "become carnal".[30] The most recent explicit mention of masturbation by top leaders in public discourse was by Tad R. Callister who stated in a 2013 speech at BYU-Idaho that God "condemns self-abuse"[31] (a euphemism for masturbation).[32] 
Church leaders have stated that outside of marriage "passionate kisses", defined as "more intense and last[ing] longer than a brief kiss",[33] and "prolonged kisses that involve the tongue and excite the passions" are "off limits".[34] For example, church president Spencer W. Kimball, called the "soul kiss" an "abomination" that leads to necking, petting, and "illegitimate babies". 
He further stated that even when dating for a time a kiss should be a "clean, decent, sexless one like the kiss between a mother and son".[35][36] He also stated that kissing during casual dating is "asking for trouble" and that kisses should not be "handed out like pretzels".[35][37] Apostle Richard G. Scott advised that physical expressions of romantic feelings between unmarried individuals should be kept to "those that are comfortable in the presence of your parents".[38] 
Church leaders have also condemned erotic touching outside of heterosexual marriage using terms like "necking" for general kissing and stroking of areas outside of the breasts, buttocks, or groin region, and "petting"[39] for "fondling a member of the opposite sex in areas that are private, personal, and sacred"[2] whether under or over clothing. 
Necking (passionate kissing with intimate touching) has been called an "insidious practice"[40] while petting was called "sinful"[41] and "an abomination before God".[5][6][42] Despite the policies on extramarital sex and making out, a 2007 survey of over 1,000 BYU students showed that 4% of single women and 3% of single men had participated in oral sex or intercourse while dating. 
Additionally, 54% of men and 46% of women BYU students reported "making out and intense kissing" while dating.[43] 
In the early 1980s, the church explicitly banned oral sex even for married couples[44][45] as it was considered an "unnatural, impure, or unholy practice", which reflected verbiage for sexual misconduct in the church's General Handbook.[46] In a January 5, 1982, First Presidency letter to bishops and other local leaders, it was explicitly stated that members who participated in any oral sex were barred from the temple unless they "repented and discontinued" this practice.[47] A follow-up letter nine months later on October 15, 1982, stated that the First Presidency had received numerous complaints of church leaders inappropriately "delving into private, sensitive matters" and directed leaders to never inquire with "explicit questions" about "intimate matters involving marital relations". 
The oral sex ban, however, was not removed, modified, or clarified, and the only additional directive to leaders was that "if the member has enough anxiety about the propriety of the conduct to ask about it, the best course would be to discontinue it". 
Subsequent discussion of marital sex warned against behaviors that the church considered unnatural, impure, and unholy, including general authority Spencer J. Condie's warning that when couples "participate in unholy practices" during their physical intimacy it can become a "disruptive force" in their marriage.[48] When discussing physical intimacy, a 2003 church manual on marriage quotes church president Spencer W. Kimball, who stated that the idea that "behind the bedroom doors anything goes" is not true nor condoned by the Lord and "if it is unnatural, you just don't do it".[49] In a private letter dated May 17, 1973, church president Harold B. Lee called "oral lovemaking" a "degrading" "perversion" that was "abhorrent in the sight of the Lord".[50][51][52] In a popular book sold by the church's bookstore and cowritten by a BYU professor, the authors state that oral sex is unworthy and impure for married couples.[53][54][55] An LDS magazine published a bishop's teaching in 2013 that oral sex was forbidden before marriage.[56] Two BYU graduate Mormon sex therapists, however, publicly stated in 2013 that oral sex was acceptable for married couples[57] as did another LDS therapist in 2014.[58] 
While official church messaging is relatively liberal regarding sex within opposite-sex and heterosexual marriages, it retains conservative doctrines regarding premarital sex. In accordance with the law of chastity, LDS Church doctrine bars sexual activity outside of heterosexual marriage. 
Most discussion regarding LDS sexual teachings, particularly outside of the church, revolves around these doctrines. 
LDS church leaders have repeatedly condemned the use of sexually arousing literature[59] and visual material for decades.[60][61] They have compared pornography to a plague[62] or epidemic[63][64] that is overpoweringly addictive like hard drugs such as cocaine on multiple occasions.[65][66][67][68][69][70] They've also stated that viewing erotic material can become a habit that's "almost impossible to break"[71] which can metaphorically "blast a crater" in the brain.[72] The church hosts meetings and has a website[73] to assist members who wish to curb their consumption of pornographic material,[74][75] and has asked church members to attend an anti-pornography rally.[76] Church leaders have also stated that women who dress immodestly become pornography to men around them.[70] 
The Church Handbook states that the three bishopric members should ensure that members from ages 12 to 17 are interviewed twice a year during which they are to discuss the "importance of obeying the commandments, particularly ... refraining from any kind of sexual activity, and refraining from viewing, reading, or listening to pornographic material."[77] It also states that disciplinary council should not be called for members "who are struggling with pornography or self-abuse."[78] 
Sociological research into pornography and LDS individuals has included one BYU study that showed of 192 male BYU students ages 18–27, 100% of the sample considered viewing pornography "unacceptable". 
However, 35% reported having used pornography in the past 12 months, with 9.2% of the entire sample reporting viewing pornography at least once in the last month.[79] No data was collected on female students. 
A nationwide study of paid porn subscriptions showed that the predominantly LDS state of Utah had the highest subscription rate of any state.[80][81] Utah's LDS then governor Gary Herbert officially declared pornography to be a public health crisis in Utah in 2016.[82] In 2017 the church school BYU released a study using data gathered online from nearly 700 unmarried English-speaking adults on the effects of religiosity on perceptions of porn addictiveness and relationship anxiety.[83] The results showed that seeing oneself as addicted to pornography generated far more anxiety- and shame-related negative outcomes individually and in romantic relationships than any potential negative effects of consuming sexually explicit material. 
Additionally, individuals reporting higher religiosity were more likely to consider themselves addicted to porn regardless of their comparative usage rate.[84][85] 
The current church stance is that "decisions about birth control and the consequences of those decisions rest solely with each married couple" and that they should consider "the physical and mental health of the mother and father and their capacity to provide the basic necessities of life for their children" when planning a family.[90] The church "strongly discourages" surgical sterilization like vasectomies and tubal ligation and encourages members to only turn to it for serious medical conditions after discussing it with a bishop.[91] The LDS Church opposes elective abortion "for personal or social convenience"[92] but states that abortion could be an acceptable option in cases of rape, incest, danger to the health or life of the mother, or where the fetus has been diagnosed with "severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth."[92] 
While not accorded the theological significance of a celestial marriage, the LDS Church does recognize civil marriages or marriages performed within other religious traditions. 
In the 1870s, a prominent Mormon writer wrote that Mormons considered such a marriage to be "no marriage at all."[117] Today, however, non-celestial marriages are respected and recognized as valid by the church, but such marriages must be legal according to the government where the marriage is performed, and must not be a same-sex marriage, polygamous marriage, common law marriage, or other type of non-ceremonial marriages in non–common law countries. 
Moreover, such marriages are thought to last only for the mortal life, and not into the next. 
In countries where the church's celestial marriages are not recognized by the government, the church requires that it be preceded by a civil marriage.[118] 
The church recognizes and officially welcomes gays and lesbians as members[120] under condition that they attempt to live the church's moral code. 
The church teaches that homosexual feelings, as distinct from behavior, may sometimes seem to be inborn,[121] and that although these feelings are sometimes unwanted, they can and should be controlled.[3] The church's law of chastity forbids homosexual sex in all contexts. 
Consistently breaking the law of chastity may result in excommunication. Nevertheless, Latter-day Saints who identify themselves as gay or lesbian may remain in good standing in the church, without ramification, if they abstain from homosexual relations.[4][10] 
Gender identity and roles play an important part in Mormon theology which teaches a strict binary of spiritual gender as literal offspring of divine parents.[124][125] Part of Sunday Church meetings are currently divided by biological sex,[126] and for most of the 1800s church presidents Joseph Smith and Brigham Young had men, women, and children sit separately for all Sunday meetings.[127]:410,413–414 Expressions and identities for sexuality and gender are "separate, but related" aspects of a person[128] and stem from similar biological origins.[129] As far as gender minorities, Church leaders have stated that they have unfinished business[130] in teaching on the difficult and sensitive topic of transgender individuals.[131][132] In the past, church president Joseph Fielding Smith, stated that he believed that those who did not reach the celestial kingdom in the afterlife would be "neither man nor woman, merely immortal beings".[133] 
The LDS Church teaches its members to obey the law of chastity, which is a code of morality and modesty. 
Under this code, all members are taught to be "morally clean in their thoughts, words, and actions" and to abstain from pornography.[1] Violations of this code include "adultery, being without natural affection, lustfulness, infidelity, incontinence,[2] filthy communications, impurity, inordinate affection, fornication. 
They included all sexual relations outside marriage—petting, sex perversion, and preoccupation with sex in one’s thoughts and talking."[3] 
Within the church, there have also been a number of unofficial statements regarding gender. 
For example, "Strengthening Our Families: An In-Depth Look at the Proclamation on the Family"[134] (a book compiled by the School of Family Life at the church-owned Brigham Young University) states, "Although we do not fully understand the eternal nature of gender, we should acknowledge its meaning and purpose, and humbly seek to understand and appreciate the nature of divine gender distinctions in God's plan for His children."[135] The book also states: 
God created us male and female. 
This is not a mistake or a variety of genetic or hormonal chance. 
What we call gender is an essential characteristic of our existence prior to our birth. 
Gender is part of our eternal identity and essential to our eternal progression. 
Although we may not know all the reasons why this is so, we do know some of the reasons why gender is essential to our eternal progression. 
To achieve our exaltation, an eternal marriage between a man and a woman is necessary. ...The sexual union between a married man and woman is, among other things, the means God has ordained to bring His spirit children into mortality, which is an essential step in the plan of salvation.[136] 
Apostle David A. Bednar stated: "[Gender] in large measure defines who we are, why we are here upon the earth, and what we are to do and become. 
For divine purposes, male and female spirits are different, distinctive, and complementary. ...The unique combination of spiritual, physical, mental, and emotional capacities of both males and females were needed to implement the plan of happiness".[1] Apostle M. Russell Ballard taught, "The premortal and mortal natures of men and women were specified by God Himself. ...[Sometimes women] ask: 'Is a woman's value dependent exclusively upon her role as a wife and mother?' 
The answer is simple and obvious: No. ...Every righteous man and woman has a significant role to play in the onward march of the kingdom of God."[137] 
Though celestial marriage is the only form of marriage recognized as a sacrament, the church permits sex within government-recognized marital unions, the notable exceptions being same-sex marriage, common law marriage, civil unions (in jurisdictions where marriage is available), and polygamy. 
The church is sensitive about its historical relationship with polygamy, and entry into a polygamous marriage, even where legal, will result in mandatory consideration of church discipline and possible excommunication.[4] Today, the church's teachings allow married couples to decide what is appropriate sexual behavior between themselves.[5] The law of chastity has also been interpreted to include various standards of modesty,[6] which have varied according to cultural norms of the time. Serious offenses of the law of chastity may result in church discipline, including the possibility of excommunication.[7] 
LGBT members of the church are expected to keep the law of chastity.[8] The church characterizes its church discipline policy as neutral regarding sexual orientation.[9] If gay or lesbian members desire to enter into a heterosexual marriage, they are advised that they should first learn to deal with their homosexual feelings; otherwise, they must remain celibate.[10] Gay or lesbian sex, in any form, whether the participants are married or not, is grounds for church discipline.[4] Participation in "repeated homosexual activities (by adults)" results in the First Presidency making a permanent special annotation to a person's membership record.[11] In most cases, gay or lesbian sex bars a person, permanently, from serving as a church missionary.[12]

Satanism is a belief or social phenomenon that features the veneration or admiration of Satan or a similar figure. 
LaVeyan Satanism, the movement founded by Anton LaVey Theistic Satanism, the worship of Satan as a deity Our Lady of Endor Coven, a cult founded by Herbert Arthur Sloane The Satanic Temple, a religious political activist group promoting secularism and bodily autonomy Satanic ritual abuse, a moral panic that occurred near the end of the 20th century

Elsewhere, Petersen noted that "Satanism as something others do is very different from Satanism as a self-designation".[8] Eugene Gallagher noted that, as commonly used, Satanism was usually "a polemical, not a descriptive term".[9] 
In 1994, the Italian sociologist Massimo Introvigne suggested defining Satanism with the simultaneous presence of "1) the worship of the character identified with the name of Satan or Lucifer in the Bible, 2) by organized groups with at least a minimal organization and hierarchy, 3) through ritual or liturgical practices." The definition applies regardless of the way in which each group perceives Satan- as personal or impersonal, real or symbolic.[10] 
Historical and anthropological research suggests that nearly all societies have developed the idea of a sinister and anti-human force that can hide itself within society.[19] This commonly involves a belief in witches, a group of individuals who invert the norms of their society and seek to harm their community, for instance by engaging in incest, murder, and cannibalism.[20] Allegations of witchcraft may have different causes and serve different functions within a society.[21] For instance, they may serve to uphold social norms,[22] to heighten the tension in existing conflicts between individuals,[22] or to scapegoat certain individuals for various social problems.[21] 
Accusations that various groups have been practicing Satanism have been made throughout much of Christian history. 
During the Middle Ages, the Inquisition attached to the Catholic Church alleged that various heretical Christian sects and groups, such as the Knights Templar and the Cathars, performed secret Satanic rituals. In the subsequent Early Modern period, belief in a widespread Satanic conspiracy of witches resulted in mass trials of alleged witches across Europe and the North American colonies. 
Accusations that Satanic conspiracies were active, and behind events such as Protestantism (and conversely, the Protestant claim that the Pope was the Antichrist) and the French Revolution continued to be made in Christendom during the eighteenth to the twentieth century. 
The idea of a vast Satanic conspiracy reached new heights with the influential Taxil hoax of France in the 1890s, which claimed that Freemasonry worshipped Satan, Lucifer, and Baphomet in their rituals. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria spread through the United States and the United Kingdom, amid fears that groups of Satanists were regularly sexually abusing and murdering children in their rites. In most of these cases, there is no corroborating evidence that any of those accused of Satanism were actually practitioners of a Satanic religion or guilty of the allegations leveled at them. 
Since the 19th century, various small religious groups have emerged that identify as Satanists or use Satanic iconography. 
The Satanist groups that appeared after the 1960s are widely diverse, but two major trends are theistic Satanism and atheistic Satanism.[1] Theistic Satanists venerate Satan as a supernatural deity, viewing him not as omnipotent but rather as a patriarch. 
In contrast, atheistic Satanists regard Satan as a symbol of certain human traits.[2] 
During the 1960s and 1970s, several rock bands— namely the American band Coven and the British band Black Widow, employed the imagery of Satanism and witchcraft in their work.[102] References to Satan also appeared in the work of those rock bands which were pioneering the heavy metal genre in Britain during the 1970s.[103] For example, the band Black Sabbath made mention of Satan in their lyrics, although several of the band's members were practicing Christians, and other lyrics affirmed the power of the Christian god over Satan.[104] In the 1980s, greater use of Satanic imagery was made by heavy metal bands like Slayer, Kreator, Sodom, and Destruction.[105] Bands active in the subgenre of death metal— among them Deicide, Morbid Angel, and Entombed, also adopted Satanic imagery, combining it with other morbid and dark imagery, such as that of zombies and serial killers.[106] 
Contemporary religious Satanism is predominantly an American phenomenon, the ideas spreading elsewhere with the effects of globalization and the Internet.[3] The Internet spreads awareness of other Satanists, and is also the main battleground for Satanist disputes.[3] Satanism started to reach Central and Eastern Europe in the 1990s, in time with the fall of the Soviet Union, and most noticeably in Poland and Lithuania, predominantly Roman Catholic countries.[4][5] 
Anton LaVey, who has been referred to as "The Father of Satanism",[145] synthesized his religion through the establishment of the Church of Satan in 1966 and the publication of The Satanic Bible in 1969. 
LaVey's teachings promoted "indulgence", "vital existence", "undefiled wisdom", "kindness to those who deserve it", "responsibility to the responsible", and an "eye for an eye" code of ethics, while shunning "abstinence" based on guilt, "spirituality", "unconditional love", "pacifism", "equality", "herd mentality", and "scapegoating". 
LaVey envisioned a Satanist as a carnal, physical, and pragmatic being. 
The core values of LaVey Satanism are the enjoyment of physical existence, and an undiluted naturalistic worldview that sees mankind as animals that exist in an amoral universe. 
In their study of Satanism, the religious studies scholars Asbjørn Dyrendal, James R. Lewis, and Jesper Aa. Petersen stated that the term Satanism "has a history of being a designation made by people against those whom they dislike; it is a term used for 'othering'".[6] The concept of Satanism is an invention of Christianity, for it relies upon the figure of Satan, a character deriving from Christian mythology.[7]

Following the British declaration of war against Germany on 4 August 1914, South Africa was an extension of the British war effort due to her status as a Dominion within the Empire. 
Although self-governing, South Africa, along with other Dominions such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand, were only semi-independent from Britain.[6] 
General Louis Botha, the then prime minister, faced widespread Afrikaner opposition to fighting alongside Great Britain so soon after the Second Boer War, and had to quell a militarily rebellion by some of the more extremist elements before he could send an expeditionary force of some 67,000 troops to invade German South West Africa (now Namibia). 
The German troops stationed there eventually surrendered to the South African forces in July 1915. 
In 1920 South Africa received a League of Nations mandate to govern the former German colony and to prepare it for independence within a few year, however South African occupation continued, illegally, until 1990.[7] 
Later, the South African Infantry Brigade, and various other supporting units such as the South African Native Labour Corps, were deployed to France in order to fight on the Western Front as the South African Overseas Expeditionary Force under British command. 
The 1st South African Brigade consisted of four infantry battalion sized regiments, representing men from all four provinces of the Union of South Africa, as well as Rhodesia. 
The 1st Regiment was from the Cape Province, the 2nd Regiment was from Natal and the Orange Free State and the 3rd Regiment was from Transvaal and Rhodesia. 
The 4th Regiment was called the South African Scottish and was raised from members of the Transvaal Scottish and the Cape Town Highlanders; they wore the Atholl Murray tartan. 
Supporting units included five batteries of heavy artillery, a field ambulance unit, a Royal Engineers signals company and a military hospital.[8] 
The most costly action that the South African forces on the Western Front fought in was the Battle of Delville Wood in 1916 – of the 3,000 men from the brigade who entered the wood, only 768 emerged unscathed.[9] Another tragic loss of life for the South African forces during the war was the Mendi sinking on 21 February 1917, when the troopship Mendi – while transporting 607 members of the South African Native Labour Corps from Britain to France – was struck and cut almost in half by another ship.[10] 
In addition, the war against the German and Askari forces in German East Africa also involved more than 20,000 South African troops; they fought under General Jan Smuts's command when he directed the British campaign against there in 1915. 
(During the war, the army was led by General Smuts, who had re-joined the army from his position as Minister of Defence on the outbreak of the war.)[11] 
With a population of roughly 6 million, between 1914 - 1918, over 250,000 South Africans of all races voluntarily served their country. 
Thousands more served in the British Army directly, with over 3,000 joining the British Royal Flying Corps and over 100 volunteering for the Royal Navy. 
More than 146,000 whites, 83,000 black Africans and 2,500 Coloureds and Asians also served in either German South-West Africa, East Africa, the Middle East, or on the Western Front in Europe. 
Suffering roughly 19,000 casualties, over 7,000 South Africans were killed, and nearly 12,000 were wounded during the course of the war.[12] Eight South Africans won the Victoria Cross for gallantry, the Empire’s highest and prestigious military medal. 
The Battle of Delville Wood and the sinking of the SS Mendi being the greatest single incidents of loss of life. 
Wartime casualties and post-war demobilisation weakened the UDF. 
New legislation in 1922 re-established conscription for white males[13] over the age of 21 for four years of military training and service and re-constituted the Permanent Force. UDF troops assumed internal security tasks in South Africa and quelled several revolts against South African domination in South-West Africa. 
South Africans suffered high casualties, especially in 1922, when an independent group of Khoikhoi – known as the Bondelswarts-Herero for the black bands that they wore into battle – led one of numerous revolts; in 1925, when a mixed-race population – the Basters – demanded cultural autonomy and political independence; and in 1932, when the Ovambo (Ambo) population along the border with Angola demanded an end to South African domination. 
During the Rand strike of 1922, 14,000 members of the ACF and certain A class reservists were called up.[14] 
Expenditure cuts saw the UDF as a whole reduced. 
The last remaining regiment of the South Africa Mounted Riflemen was disbanded on 31 March 1926 and the number of military districts was reduced from 16 to six on 1 April 1926. 
The Brigade HQ of the SA Field Artillery was also disbanded.[1] In 1933 the six military districts were redesignated Commands.[2]:9 As a result of its conscription policies, the UDF increased its active-duty forces to 56,000 by the late 1930s; 100,000 men also belonged to the National Riflemen's Reserve, which provided weapons training and practice. 
During World War II, the South African Army fought in the East African, North African and Italian campaigns. 
In 1939, the army at home in South Africa was divided between a number of regional commands.[15] These included Cape Command (with its headquarters at the Castle of Good Hope, Cape Town), Orange Free State Command, Natal Command, Witwatersrand Command (5th and 9th Brigades plus the Transvaal Horse Artillery), Robert's Heights and Transvaal Command (HQ Robert's Heights) and Eastern Province Command at East London. 
The role of the Army was fundamentally changed by the upheavals of the early 1990s and after 1994 the Army became part of the new SANDF. It is now becoming increasingly involved in peacekeeping efforts in southern Africa, often as part of wider African Union operations. The Army is composed of roughly 40,100 regular uniformed personnel, augmented by 12,300 reserve force personnel. 
The rank/age structure of the army, which deteriorated desperately during the 1990s, is greatly improving through the Military Skills Development (MSDS) voluntary national service system. Through this system, young healthy members are being inducted into the regular and reserve forces every year. 
In 1948, the new Minister of Defence, Frans Erasmus, aimed ' to level the playing-fields' within the Union Defence Force, which was strongly British-oriented in usages, structures, uniforms and nomenclature.[18] This developed from an attempt at affirmative action into a 'politically tinged purge'. 
The various Commando units, previously 'Skietverenigings', were later classified as Type A, B or C independent Commandos and continued as single-battalion or small independent units. 
As part of the post-war reorganisation, the Defence Rifle Associations were disbanded in 1948 and replaced by a new Commando organisation with a strength of 90,000 men.[19] At the same time, the Afrikaans-oriented single-battalion regiments founded in 1934 underwent at least one change of name and sometimes more. 
An early victim was the renowned Middellandse Regiment, which became Regiment Gideon Scheepers in 1954. 
The Defence Act (No. 44) of 1957 renamed the UDF the South African Defence Force (SADF) and established within it some quick-reaction units, or Commandos, to respond to localised threats. 
The SADF, numbering about 20,000 in 1958, would grow to almost 80,000 in the next two decades. 
After the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, General Jan Smuts, the Union's first Minister of Defence, placed a high priority on creating a unified military out of the separate armies of the union's four provinces (the British Cape Colonial Forces, and the forces of the Natal Colony, the Transvaal, and the Orange River Colony). 
The Defence Act (No. 13) of 1912 established a Union Defence Force (UDF) that included a Permanent Force (or standing army) of career soldiers, an Active Citizen Force of temporary conscripts and volunteers as well as a Cadet organisation.[3] The 1912 law also obligated all white males between seventeen and sixty years of age to serve in the military, but this was not strictly enforced as there were a large number of volunteers. 
Instead, half of the white males aged from 17 to 25 were drafted by lots into the ACF. 
For training purposes, the Union was divided into 15 military districts.[2]:2 
Other operations that the Army was tasked with by government include: Operation Boleas (Lesotho), Operation Fibre (Burundi), Operation Triton (five times in the Comoros), Operation Amphibian (Rwanda), Operation Montego (Liberia), Operation Espresso (Ethiopia) , Operation Cordite (Sudan), Operation Teutonic and Operation Bulisa (both in the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Operation Pristine (Ivory Coast), Operation Vimbezela (Central African Republic) and Operation Bongane (Uganda).[1] 
Since the Defence Act of 1912, the South African Army has been comprised, in general terms, of three groupings. 
The first is the standing army, also known since the 1970s as the Permanent Force. A military reserve force was also established by the terms of the 1912 Act and initially designated the Active Citizen Force. The force was established on 1 July 1913.[1] Other designations through the years have included Active Reserve Force, Citizen Force, Conventional Reserve and Territorial Reserve.[citation needed] The Deloitte and Touche plan, as well as various policies over the years have referred to a 'One Force Concept' where reservists and reserve units are supposed to be treated on an equal footing with the permanent force counterparts. 
This is often not the case. 
Due to the restructuring of the Reserves, the exact number of reserves is difficult to ascertain. 
However the 2011/12 planning target was 12,400 reserves.[37] 
The South African Army maintains large bases in all 9 provinces of the country, mostly in or around major cities and towns:[41] The army has 10 general support bases, seemingly part of the South African Army Support Formation. 
One of the largest bases in the country[42] is Tempe Military Base which is located in Bloemfontein and is home to 1 South African Tank Regiment, 1 Special Service Battalion (Armoured Car Regiment), the South African School of Armour (which offers decentralized training to regular and reserve regiments), 44 Parachute Regiment and 1 South African Infantry Battalion (Mechanized Infantry). 
The parachute training wing is also located here.

Just south of Thaba Tshwane and within a separate area is Technical Base Complex Centurion, which is home to Bagaka Regiment, Ukhosi Parachute Engineer Regiment, 1 Military Printing Regiment, 4 Survey and Map Regiment, and the Army Engineer Formation.[45] Reportedly it also houses the Technical Service Training Centre, and units from the SAMHS and the SAAF. 
The base, whose TEK appellation may be derived from "Tegnies Basis Werkswinkel", is located at Centurion, south of Pretoria. 
It has a housing complex for active members. 
Wallmannsthal is home to 43 SA Brigade Headquarters. 
Centurion is home to 3 Parachute Battalion.

History 
Following the declaration of the Republic of South Africa in 1961, the "Royal" title was dropped from the names of army regiments like the Natal Carbineers and the Durban Light Infantry, and the Crown removed from regimental badges. 
They also carried out operations in support of UNITA rebels in Angola and against the Cuban troops that supported the Angolan government. 
A pornographic film actor or actress, adult entertainer, or porn star is a person who performs sex acts in video that is usually characterized as a pornographic movie. 
Such videos tend to be made in a number of distinct pornographic subgenres and attempt to present a sexual fantasy and the actors selected for a particular role are primarily selected on their ability to create or fit that fantasy. Pornographic videos are characterised as either "softcore", which does not contain depictions of sexual penetration or "extreme fetishism" and "hardcore", which can contain depictions of penetration or extreme fetishism, or both. 
The genres and sexual intensity of videos is mainly determined by demand. Depending on the genre of the film, the on-screen appearance, age, and physical features of the main actors and their ability to create the sexual mood of the video is of critical importance. Most actors specialize in certain genres, such as gay sex, lesbian sex, bondage, strap-on sex, anal sex, double penetration, semen swallowing, teenage women, interracial or MILFs. 
Morphine is a pain medication of the opiate family that is found naturally in a dark brown, resinous form, from the poppy plant (Papaver somniferum). 
It can be taken orally or injected; it is also often smoked.[7][9] It acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to increase feelings of pleasure and warm relaxation and to reduce pain, and is often abused for this purpose.[7] It can be taken for both acute pain and chronic pain and is frequently used for pain from myocardial infarction, kidney stones, and during labor.[7] Morphine can be administered by mouth, by injection into a muscle, by injection under the skin, intravenously, injection into the space around the spinal cord, or rectally.[7] Its maximum effect is reached after about 20 minutes when administered intravenously and 60 minutes when administered by mouth, while the duration of its effect is 3–7 hours.[7][8] Long-acting formulations of morphine are available as MS-Contin, Kadian, and other brand names as well as generically.[7]

In 2013 the channel went regional, with the installation of a new antenna. 
This meant viewers would be able to watch Soweto TV across Gauteng. 
The 360-degree antenna would allow viewers across a wider geographical area absolute access to the channel at no extra cost. 
The station opened its spread on 16 June 2013. 
It came after the old Bop TV transmitter was removed, which had restricted the TV station to broadcasting locally, only reaching Soweto. 
With the new antenna, Soweto TV would reach as far as Heidelberg, Benoni, Springs and Nigel in the east; Tembisa, Vanderbijlpark, Vereeniging and Sasolburg in the south; and Pretoria North and Mamelodi in the north [3] 
In August 2018, Soweto TV announced Bridget Nkuna as their new CEO.[4] Nkuna was appointed by the channel; because her strong marketing background, having worked as a director for Westcon Group, an international technology company.

In October 2018 she revealed new state-of-the-art broadcasting equipment donated by MultiChoice[5][6] “We’re excited about the donation as it came at the right time when we are celebrating our 11th birthday. 
Community TV channels fulfil a very important role in communities – we tell the stories of our community and create a sense of belonging. 
We’re looking forward to continuing to play our role in the stories of the people of Soweto.”[citation needed] 
Months later, the remaining board members would also resign from the board leaving only Mr. Tuis Jabulani Nkutha in the board. 
Following the decision by the board to step down, ICASA gave the only remaining board member, Mr Nkutha and CEO, Ms Nkuna a mandated to appoint people from the community to a steering committee that would be in charge at the channel for six months in preparation for the Annual General Meeting (AGM). 
In an article, it would be alleged that Nkutha and Nkuna appointed their own preferred people to the board, who also happened to be their personal friends.[7] Soon after the new board was appointed, Ms. Nkuna, was placed on special leave. 
Board member, Thabo Molefe also known as Tbo Touch[8] was then appointed the channel's acting CEO.[9] 
It is alleged that at his first meeting with the Soweto TV staff he threatened staff, saying they [board members] are not afraid of anyone and they have a budget for CCMA and any court action taken against them. 
Soweto Community Television (Soweto TV)[1] is a South African community television channel broadcasting in the biggest township in South Africa, Soweto. The channel is free-to-air in Gauteng Province and it also broadcast to South African subscribers on the DStv pay TV service on channel 251 and Starsat on channel 488. 
By the end of 2019, it was reported to ICASA that an illegitimate board had been appointed and was running the channel. Speaking to Sowetan LIVE in an article[10] released on 17 January 2020, Mr. Thafeng said ICASA was fully aware of what's happening at the channel but was not doing anything about it. 
ICASA spokesperson Paseka Maleka confirmed receipt of the complaint in relation to the election of the board. 
"The complaints and compliance commission is investigating the matter," he said. 
Upon returning from festive season holidays on 6 January 2020, 9 Soweto TV producers (Ayanda Dyantyi, Cinderella Mpahlwa, Dennis Segwe,[11] Jonathan Ramotsei, Masego Ruele, Nompilo Mlotshwa, Samulelisiwe Sibiya, Sipho Mpungose and Themba Thanjekwayo) were placed on suspension without being charged. About two weeks would pass till they were charged with gross negligence or, failing to perform duties without proper cause, loss of revenue and viewership for the channel and failing to sign a performance contract during November 2019. 
On 27 January 2020 the channel's Chairperson, Mr Spencer Malongete addressing the suspension of the channel's producers amongst other things. 
The statement read: Soweto TV has been mismanaged for a decade and was on the verge of liquidation when all the members of the board resigned with immediate effect leaving only 1 board member who also one of the founding members of Soweto. 
The regulator ICASA instructed the remaining member to properly constitute a team of directors who will stabilize the channel and take it forward. 
The new board appointed an investigator and the following was discovered: • Soweto TV has not been compliant with the regulator ICASA in News and factual content. • The channel accumulated an unpaid SARS bill amounting to R14,439 400 million rand. • No performance management or monitoring contracts to measure deliverables and accountability. • The channel had excessive amount of repeats for the year 2017, 2018 and 2019 with constant incorrect electronic program guide for viewers • The previous management never submitted Tax returns for years with violations and penalties from the revenue service • There was no policy or any form of governance on the day to day operations, service providers were appointed with no procurement processes and business processes were compromised • Churches and key community organizations terminated their contracts with the Channel • Channel had 84 staff members, a couple of them were ‘ghosts’ employees earning a salary with no trace of working at Soweto TV, some have been with the channel for almost a decade with no contribution to the Channel. 
Interventions to date: The Board has alleviated the risk of the channel from being liquidated. 
The Board has engaged ICASA and relevant stake holders on its plans to stabilize the channel and ensure that Soweto TV succeeds. 
The board took a resolution to appoint Mr. Thabo Molefe as the new Acting CEO and the following has been effected: • Since September 2019, the channel has committed to paying the receiver and has reduced the bill from R14 439 400 to R4 567 000. • The channel has complied with the local content regulation and continues to reflect the community back to the audience. • The channel has instituted both an acquisition and editorial policy putting Soweto TV amongst the leading broadcaster’s in South Africa • We’ve implemented new automated commercial systems that enables advertisers and sales agencies to monitor their investment and maintain schedule stability • The channel has formulated policies that speaks to governance, accountability and performance. • The channel has attended Multichoice content and management workshops • The channel has hosted auditions for new shows with new faces to be introduced in February 2020. • 9 New shows have been produced and being released throughout the next months • The brand of Soweto TV has been revived and in 2020 the audience will have an opportunity to view more local content and engage with a number of new initiatives. 
The new Board is committed to the success of Soweto TV. 
Once we have achieved programming and commercial stability, the Board will roll out the next phase of its work programme which shall consist of increased community engagement including scheduling editorial consultations as well as membership rules to enable increased community participation. 
The new Board will not be distracted by the opportunistic campaigns which are waged by people who have failed the Channel before. The community must not be misled by such people. 
On Friday, 6 March 2020, all the producers received emails dismissing them from the channel. The producers have taken the matter to the CCMA.

In May 2008, the channel submitted an application for a new licence, but the expiry date for the previous license, came and went without the channel receiving a new license due to a back-log at ICASA.[2] The channel's future seemed uncertain despite successfully broadcasting for a year. 
Despite not having a license, the channel was allowed to continue broadcasting whilst ICASA was processing the application, though terms of the Electronic Communications Act of 2005, which stated that: no-one may broadcast without a licence. 
In 2010 Webometrics ranked the university the 15th best in South Africa and 5662th in the world.[4] In 2018, the university ranked 9th best university in South Africa 
As the number of students registering annually grows rapidly, records show that Tshwane University of Technology caters for approximately 90,000 students and it has become the largest residential higher education institution in South Africa. [citation needed] 
There were 88,078 students enrolled for the year 2012 at the Tshwane University of Technology. 
It was estimated, for the year 2014, that the number of first year student applications the university received were around 80,000. 
Tshwane University of Technology predominantly provides vocational qualifications in the form of three-year diplomas. 
Articulation options exist in the form of advanced diplomas, postgraduate and masters and doctoral degrees. These qualifications are offered through the following faculties: 
After the end of apartheid, the South African Police was renamed the South African Police Service (SAPS), and the Ministry of Law and Order was renamed the Ministry of Safety and Security, in keeping with these symbolic reforms. The new Minister of Safety and Security, Sydney Mufamadi, obtained police training assistance from Zimbabwe, the United Kingdom and Canada and proclaimed that racial tolerance and human rights would be central to police training in the future. 
By the end of 1995, the SAPS had incorporated the ten police agencies of the former homelands, and had reorganised at both national and provincial level. 
The current ranking system of the South African Police Service was adopted in April 2010.[10] The change caused some controversy as new ranks like "general" and "colonel" have a military connotation. 
Furthermore, the new rank system mirrors the system used by the South African Police during the apartheid era. In 2009, Deputy Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula spoke of making the police a paramilitary force by changing the SAPS ranking system so that it would closely mirror the military ranking system. 
This created a significant amount of controversy from people critical of what they called the "militarisation" of the police.[11][12][13] 
The ranking system was amended in 2016. 
The role of regional police commissioner was introduced, with the rank of lieutenant general. 
The major and lieutenant ranks were eliminated, with lieutenants assuming the rank of captain and majors assuming the rank of lieutenant colonel.[14][15] 
The South African Police Service (SAPS) is the national police force of the Republic of South Africa. 
Its 1,154 police stations[2] in South Africa are divided according to the provincial borders, and a Provincial Commissioner is appointed in each province. 
The nine Provincial Commissioners report directly to the National Commissioner. 
The head office is in the Wachthuis Building in Pretoria.[3] 
The South African Police Service operate a fleet of 34 aeroplanes and helicopters.[16] 
Since the departure of democratic South Africa's first National commissioner George Fivaz in January 2000, a number of successive commissioners have been unable to complete a single term in office, most implicated in and charged with misconduct.[17][18] 
The distribution of personnel has been controversial, with local legislators questioning why areas most in need of policing resources are being neglected.[19] The department was criticised by the Western Cape Government for providing the lowest number personnel (adjusted for population) with a shortage of 2,392 officers,[20] despite having the highest murder rate.[21][22] This has been the subject of the Khayelitsha Commission. 
The Constitution of South Africa lays down that the South African Police Service has a responsibility to prevent, combat and investigate crime, maintain public order, protect and secure the inhabitants of the Republic and their property, uphold and enforce the law, create a safe and secure environment for all people in South Africa, prevent anything that may threaten the safety or security of any community, investigate any crimes that threaten the safety or security of any community, ensure criminals are brought to justice and participate in efforts to address the causes of crime.[4] 
Amnesty International has expressed concerns about police brutality, including torture and extrajudicial killings, in South Africa.[23][24][25][26][27][28] There has also been concern about brutal training methods for the police.[29] According to Peter Jordi from the Wits Law Clinic "[Police] Torture is spiralling out of control. 
It is happening everywhere."[30] Brandon Edmonds argues that "The cops prey on the poor in this country."[31] Independent studies have confirmed that the SAPS has been used to repress peaceful marches.[32] In April 2009, SAPS attempted to ban unFreedom Day[33] and was implicated in support for September 2009 ANC mob that attacked the elected leadership of the shack settlement at Kennedy Road, Durban.[34][35][36] Police officers have also been accused of excessive policing in Blikkiesdorp in Delft, Cape Town, by suppression of freedom and ordering illegal curfews.[37][38][39] 
Amnesty International and others have expressed serious concerns about South African police brutality, including torture and extrajudicial killings.[5][6][7] 
The South African Police Service traces its origin to the Dutch Watch, a paramilitary organisation formed by settlers in the Cape Province in 1655 to protect civilians and to maintain law and order. 
In 1795, British officials assumed control over the Dutch Watch, and in 1825 established the Cape Constabulary (which became the Cape Town Police Force in 1840). 
In 1854, a police force was established in Durban which would become the Durban Borough Police, and in 1935 the Durban City Police (DCP).[8] Act 3 of 1855 established the Frontier Armed and Mounted Police Force in the Eastern Cape, restyled as the Cape Mounted Riflemen in 1878.[9] 
The South Africa national soccer team represents South Africa in men's international soccer and it is run by the South African Football Association, the governing body for Soccer in South Africa. The team's nickname is Bafana Bafana, and South Africa's home ground is FNB Stadium, which is located in Johannesburg. The team's greatest result was winning the Africa Cup of Nations at home in 1996. 
The team is a member of both FIFA and Confederation of African Football (CAF). 
Having played their first match in 1906, they returned to the world stage in 1992, after 16 years of being banned from FIFA, and 40 years of effective suspension due to the apartheid system.[4] South Africa became the first African nation to host the FIFA World Cup when it was granted host status for the 2010 edition. 
The team's Siphiwe Tshabalala was also the first player to score in this World Cup during the opening game against Mexico, which was followed by an iconic Macarena-style goal celebration from five South African players.[5][6] Despite defeating France 2–1 in their final game of the Group Stage, they failed to progress from the first round of the tournament, becoming the first host nation in the history of the FIFA World Cup to exit in the group stage.[7] Despite this, the team ranked 20th out of 32 sides, ranking higher than 12 teams who qualified.

Nkosilathi Nyathi (born 2003) is a Zimbabwean environmental activist. 
He started campaigning at the age of 10 and advocates for youth inclusion in decision making roles.[1][2] He is of the opinion youths’ efforts towards climate justice can not materialize if they can’t make calls at decision making platforms.[3] Nkosilathi was at 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference COP25 in Madrid campaigning for more climate actions and youth inclusion from world leaders.[2][4] 
He traced back his environmental activism journey to the day he stood up with consciousness at a garbage dumping site at Victoria Falls and becoming more aware of the environment issues in his immediate community.[5] He started noticing the effects of climate change in his environment at the age of 11 in Grade 5 at Chamabondo Primary School in Zimbabwe.[5][6] Victoria Fall witnessed the worst drought in a century in 2019.[3][7][8] 7.7 million Zimbabwean people are food insecure and 45 million people of southern Africans at risk of hunger.[9][10][11] There is also an unprecedented acute malnutrition rates of over five per cent in eight of the Zimbabwean’s districts.[10] All these issues manifesting in his community triggered him to start teaching his community about climate change and to continuously call for reduction the global emissions and he has pledge ever to relent until decision makers start taking considerable climate actions.[7][12]

Nkosi Johnson (born Xolani Nkosi; (1989-02-04)4 February 1989 – (2001-06-01)1 June 2001) was a South African child with HIV and AIDS who greatly influenced public perceptions of the pandemic and its effects before his death at the age of 12. 
He was ranked fifth amongst SABC3's Great South Africans.[1] At the time of his death, he was the longest-surviving child born HIV-positive in South Africa.[2] 
Nkosi was born to Nonthlanthla Daphne Nkosi in a village near Dannhauser in 1989.[3] He never knew his father. 
Nkosi was HIV-positive from birth, and was legally adopted by Gail Johnson, a Johannesburg Public Relations practitioner, when his own mother, debilitated by the disease, was no longer able to care for him.[4] 
Nkosi was the keynote speaker at the 13th International AIDS Conference, where he encouraged people with HIV/AIDS to be open about the disease and to seek equal treatment. 
Nkosi finished his speech with the words:[5] 
Nelson Mandela referred to Nkosi as an "icon of the struggle for life."[6] 
The Department of Social Development (DSD) of South Africa is a government department responsible for providing social development, protection, and welfare services to the public. 
Previously called the Department of Welfare, it was renamed in July 2000.[1] The current Minister of Social Development is Lindiwe Zulu. 
a child support grant; older person's grant (a pension); disability grant; war veteran’s grant; care dependency grant, for caring for a child with severe disability; foster child grant; grant-in-aid, for those who need a full-time caregiver; and/or social relief of distress, a temporary measure for people in dire need, in the form of parcels or vouchers. 
Steyn pledged R 320 000 000.00 to assist the coronavirus relief.[10] 
In January 2012, Cash Paymaster Services (CPS), a subsidiary of Net1 UEPS Technologies, was awarded a five-year, R10 billion tender to distribute social grants on behalf of SASSA from February 2012.[1][11] A rival bidder, AllPay, challenged the procurement process in court; in 2014 the Constitutional Court found that irregular processes had been followed, and consequently declared the tender invalid, but suspended the order in order not to interrupt grant payments, and to allow SASSA an opportunity to initiate a new tender process.[12][13] 
Each month, the National Treasury deposits the total amount to be paid out into a Nedbank trust account. 
Interest earned during this period goes to the state. 
All beneficiary accounts are held at Grindrod Bank.[1] 
A grant recipient can withdraw their grant from any SASSA paypoint across the country, which carries no withdrawal charge, and which Net1 CEO Serge Belamont claims is more secure because of the biometric security checks on fingerprints; or from designated retailers such as Pick n Pay, which work with EasyPay, another company owned by Net1, to allow these withdrawals; or from ATMs.[1] 
Moneyline, another Net1 company, provides loans to grant recipients. 
Umoya Manje, also another company owned by Net1, allows grant beneficiaries to buy cellphone airtime on credit.[1] 
The first Department was established in 1937, to regulate and subsidise existing private, non-governmental welfare services, while providing some additional services. 
The 1997 White Paper for Social Welfare noted that post-Apartheid South Africa had inherited social welfare programmes which were “not considered to be critical social investment priorities and were under-resourced”.[2] 
In December 2014, a ministerial task team concluded that SASSA itself should take over the paying out of grants.[14] In 2015, SASSA issued a new tender but did not award it,[2] opting instead to insource the disbursement of grants by 2017.[3] 
In the 2015/2016 financial year, SASSA recorded additional, irregular expenditure on the CPS contract for the re-registration of grant beneficiaries because legal requirements had been circumvented.[15] 
The then Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan advised the Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini to award a new contract to commercial South African banks and the South African Post Office (SAPO),[1] and forego biometric identification, which contract requirement disadvantaged others bidders against CPS. 
However, this proposal was rejected on the grounds that the biometric system had eliminated fraudulent claims amounting to R2 billion annually;[16] that further work to remove duplicate entries could save another R2 billion annually; and that SAPO did not have a banking licence, nor enough post offices to properly distribute grants.[3][4] Dlamini expressed a desire to remain with CPS until SASSA was capable to take over, reasoning that this posed the least risk of SASSA defaulting on grant payments.[5] She claimed that the process to distribute grants through SASSA was well underway, insisting that the Department was halfway through a four-phase plan which would culminate in 2019 with the handing over of the responsibility to SASSA.[6] 
Dlamini claimed in 2017 that she had only become aware in October 2016 that SASSA was likely to be unable to take over grants payments from April 2017.[1] 
SASSA estimated it would pay CPS about R3.5 billion annually under a renewed contract, between 52% and 59% more than it already did. 
SASSA later denied that it had done such estimation, and then claimed that it was a simple inflation-related adjustment, which was not true.[17][18] 
Dlamini had been advised in October 2016 that the DSD was obliged to engage in competitive tendering, and could therefore not sign a contract with CPS; she was informed that the grants crisis was also not a justification to continue using CPS, since the emergency had been self-created; and she also received a legal opinion from senior counsel Wim Trengove that the extant CPS contract could not be legally extended since it had already been ruled invalid by the Constitutional Court.[1] 
In December 2016, SASSA was also advised to inform the Constitutional Court of its predicament, "that it faced the highly irregular prospect of going into contract for another year with [CPS]". 
The Agency waited until 28 February 2017 to lodge a plea, which it immediately withdrew the next day, using a letter dated the previous day.[1] 
In February 2017, SASSA told Parliament's social development portfolio committee it had come up short in attempts to find working solutions to pay social grants, and claimed that the only way to make social grant payments from April was to stick with the service provider whose contract had been declared invalid.[1][19] 
SASSA's Zodwa Mvulane told Parliament at the start of March 2017 that legal complexities beyond its control had left the Agency with too little time to phase out CPS, stating that they "only had a year, from September 2015, to prepare for being a paymaster". 
However, SASSA only began to prepare for a post-CPS solution in December, "doing little or nothing until then"; a committee advising it had until then been ignored for years. 
While SASSA told Parliament it had not had enough time, it had also claimed before the Constitutional Court that it would not need CPS a year after the 2017/2018 financial year—contradicting a letter by Dlamini, sent on 2 February, that stated CPS would no longer be needed at the end of 2019, and another letter sent a week later by SASSA chief executive Thokozani Magwaza, which claimed that the contract with CPS would only last until November 2018—both longer than a year.[1] 
The Black Sash Trust, through representation by the Centre for Applied Legal Studies, launched an application to the Constitutional Court, asking it to compel Dlamini and SASSA to take necessary measures to ensure the social grants system and its beneficiaries were protected when the CPS contract ended on 31 March.[1] On 6 March 2017, the contract with Cash Paymaster Services was renewed, and the Constitutional Court's order of invalidity with regard to that contract again suspended, for another year. 
The Court held that no party had “any claim to profit from the threatened invasion of people’s rights” but also understood that CPS could not be expected to deliver grants at a loss; it therefore ordered CPS to continue to deliver social grants at the same price it had contracted for in 2012.[20] 
The Department "endeavours to create a better life for the poor, vulnerable and excluded people in society". 
It is tasked with reducing poverty, promoting social integration, and creating conditions for sustainable livelihoods. Lorna also works there. 
The Department also conducts research that develops the social indicators necessary for programme implementation and public accountability.[3] 
The Constitutional Court found that "the responsible functionaries of SASSA" had been aware from April 2016 that they could not comply with their undertaking to the Court previously that they would be able to pay social grants from 1 April 2017.[1] The Constitutional Court held Dlamini primarily responsible for the crisis,[21] with Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng saying there was no explanation for the incompetence displayed by her and SASSA.[22] According to constitutional scholar Pierre de Vos, the Constitutional Court had concluded that SASSA and Dlamini could not be trusted to do their constitutionally mandated job to ensure delivery of social grants, and could not be trusted not to lie to the courts in the future.[20] 
Between 2013 and 2017, the DSD spent R30 million on the costs of legal appeals involving SASSA.[23] 
In 2004, the DSD amended the Social Assistance Act in order to disallow anyone other than the beneficiary to deduct money from their account.[1][2] 
However, 10,262 complaints about deductions were made between April 2015 and March 2016, and the DSD itself claimed "for the past two to three years" to have been fighting illegal deducations from social grants.[24] Many of the unauthorised deductions were claimed by CPS to be repayment of non-existent Moneyline loans,[2][25] and sales of airtime and electricity.[24] 
In June 2016, SASSA, the Black Sash, and the Association of Community Advice Office (ACAOSA) laid criminal charges against the directors of CPS and Grindrod Bank, claiming that the two companies were not implementing amended regulations under the Social Assistance Act, which amendments compelled companies not to deduct money from social grant beneficiary accounts for financial services.[1] The criminal charges were frozen until October, when Net1 was to receive clarity from a High Court as to regulations.[26] In a founding affidavit lodged with the North Gauteng High Court, Black Sash asked the court to ring-fence social grant accounts in order to protect grant beneficiaries from exploitation or abuse, and to prevent companies from soliciting beneficiaries around SASSA paypoints[27]—practices which Black Sash and the DSD accused Net1 and its subsidiaries of encouraging.[28] 
Central Drug Authority 
The Central Drug Authority (CDA) was established in 1992, under section 2 of the Prevention and Treatment of the Drug Dependency Act. 
Its key functions are to effect the National Drug Master Plan; advise the Minister of Social Development on matters affecting substance and drug abuse; and promote measures relating to the prevention and reduction of drug abuse.[6] 
Since the 1990s, welfare services have been allocated 10% of the Department’s overall budget. 
According to researcher Lisa Vetten, pay increases for the Department's civil servants have been consistently higher than inflation for the past 10 years; these increases have shrunk the budget for provision of services, and have correspondingly diminished funding to the non-governmental organisation (NGO) sector. 
She argues underfunding has created a two-tier system of care, in which government services are considerably better resourced than NGO counterparts. 
Further exacerbating NGOs’ situations is the Department's late payment of their subsidies.[1] 
The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) is a national agency of the government created in April 2005 in order to distribute social grants on behalf of the Department of Social Development. 
The DSD has an oversight role over the Agency but no operational control over it.[4] It was also designed to reallocate the function of social security from South Africa's provinces to the national sphere of government and reports to the Department of Social Development (DSD). 
Its current chief executive officer is Abraham Mahlungu.[5][citation needed] SASSA is a public entity in terms of Schedule 3A of the Public Finance Management Act.[3] 
The key functions of the parastatal are related to the administration and payment of social grants: the processing of applications, verification and approval of applications, disbursement and payment of grants to eligible beneficiaries, quality assurance, and fraud prevention and detection.[1] 
South Africa's social welfare recipients have grown from 3.8 million in April 2001 to 11 million in March 2006,[7] and 17 million in 2017.[8] 
On 29 June 2021, Zuma was sentenced to 15 months in prison for contempt of court, after he refused to appear at a commission his government appointed to investigate alleged corruption during his time in office.[34] He was given until the end of 4 July to hand himself in, after which the South African Police Service would be obliged to arrest him. 
However on 3 July, the court agreed on to hear his application on 12 July.[35] If Zuma refused to surrender by 4 July, the police were given till 7 July to arrest him.[36] Supporters had gathered near his home with weapons to prevent his arrest,[37] however, he handed himself over to the police on 7 July,[38][39] and was jailed at the Estcourt Correctional Centre.[37] 
On 8 July 2021, the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Ronald Lamola announced that Zuma would be eligible for parole upon serving a quarter of his 15-month sentence.[40] Zuma challenged his detention on 9 July in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on the grounds of health, but this was rejected.[41] His arrest led to violent protests by his supporters, who dubbed their campaign as "Free Jacob Zuma and shut down KZN," in the KwaZulu-Natal province.[42] 
On 9 July 2021, the same day Pietermaritzburg High Court upheld his conviction and prison sentence, the unrest began.[23][43] Public violence, burglary, and malicious damage to property were reported in parts of KwaZulu-Natal, with at least 28 people being arrested and a highway being blocked.[43] The riots continued on the evening of Sunday, 11 July 2021, when multiple news sources indicated reports of gunshots and explosions heard at local malls and residential areas.[44] The violence quickly escalated, and by the morning of Monday, 12 July 2021, multiple companies and malls were forced to close following widespread looting and violence.[45] As of 21 July, 276 people have died due to the unrest,[46] while 3,407 were arrested by 18 July.[20] 
Riots and protests took place in South Africa from 9 to 17 July 2021, in response to the arrest of former President Jacob Zuma. 
The riots triggered wider rioting and looting, fuelled by job layoffs and economic inequality and worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.[21][22] The unrest began in the province of KwaZulu-Natal on the evening of 9 July,[3] and spread to the province of Gauteng on the evening of 11 July.[24][25] 
Jacob Zuma's daughter, Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, is allegedly among those who have encouraged the looting and violence in order to secure the release of her father as an unverified Twitter account under her name encouraged people to protest.[55][56] 
Zuma was taken into custody after declining to testify at the Zondo Commission, an inquiry into allegations of corruption during his term as president from 2009 to 2018. 
The riots began as protests by his supporters in KwaZulu-Natal before escalating to widespread looting and violence throughout KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng.[26] The Constitutional Court reserved judgement on Zuma's application to rescind his sentence on 12 July 2021.[27][28][29] As of 22 July, 337 people have died in the unrest,[19] while 3,407 had been arrested by 18 July.[20] 
Road closures on both the N3 and N2 have affected the transportation of goods from the east coast into provinces in the north.[70][71][72] This affects the transportation of goods to landlocked countries in Africa including Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia.[73][74] 
The container ports of Richards Bay and Durban have ceased operations. 
Containers in the port of Durban have been plundered. 
After several attacks on trucks, the N3 Highway, which links port Durban with Johannesburg, was closed on 10 July.[77] 
State-owned logistics operator Transnet declared force majeure on 14 July on a rail line linking Johannesburg to the coast.[78] 
On 12 July 2021, the Consumer Goods Council of South Africa warned that widespread looting, destruction and closures would lead to food shortages across the country.[79] By 14 July 2021, damage to transport infrastructure had caused food shortages, leading to queues outside grocery stores, and prevented harvesting and distribution of fresh produce.[80] On 15 July 2021, the largest food manufacturer in South Africa Tiger Brands suspended bakery operations in affected areas due to damaged infrastructure and facilities while also noting that it had suffered a loss of stock in excess of R150 million.[81] Some stores and petrol stations in Johannesburg noted that their shelves were getting emptied and supplies were dwindling due to panic buying.[82] A Durbanite journalist noted that while bread had returned to their area, people were paying significantly more for it and were queueing for many hours at a time.[83] Stores were also placing limits on how much customers could buy while community-run barricades reportedly turned people away if they could not prove they were from those communities.[83] 
The Sapref oil refinery, which is a joint venture between Shell and BP, is the largest oil refinery in Sub Saharan Africa.[84] It supplies approximately one third of South Africa's fuel needs and its operations were suspended due to a declaration of force majeure.[84] On 15 July 2021, the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy placed prohibitions on the citizens' ability to buy fuel in portable containers and canisters, citing concerns that stockpiling would exacerbate the situation.[85] 
Clicks and Dis-Chem, the two largest pharmaceutical retailers in South Africa, reported supply disruptions due to looting. 
The provision of clinical medicine to hospitals was also disrupted.[86] As of 16 July, it has been estimated that approximately 50% of patients with chronic illness in KwaZulu-Natal lack an adequate supply of necessary medicine.[87] Healthcare providing facilities in Pietermaritzburg were placed under severe pressure due to many members of staff being unable to get to their posts, while those that did get there had to deal with an influx of trauma patients.[88] A junior doctor from Pietermaritzburg said that the disruptions in the supply chain resulted in an inability to restock medication, PPE, blood, and syringes.[88] 
The South African rand weakened as much as 2% on 12 July, the most it has since 25 February.[89] Based on a preliminary analysis on 13 July, the SA Special Risks Insurance Association (SASRIA) estimated that total losses due to damage and looting may run into "billions of rand".[90] 
On 19 July 2021, officers of the eThekwini municipality and KwaZulu-Natal provincial government provided a recovery roadmap to the Toyota Motor Corporation. 
Reportedly, the unrest had led the multinational to doubt the security and viability of its investments in the province.[91] 
By Monday afternoon on 12 July, more than 200 shopping centres had been looted, with several in Soweto having been ransacked.[92] On 14 July, the SA Pharmacy Council noted that 90 pharmacies were completely destroyed with the bulk of those in KwaZulu-Natal being hit the hardest.[93] In Durban, during a 14 July media briefing, the mayor of eThekwini announced that up to 45,000 businesses were affected with 129,000 jobs at stake and over R16 billion (nearly $1 billion or £793 million) in damages to stock, property, and equipment.[94] ICASA announced that 113 network towers had been vandalised, resulting in the disruption of cellular networks.[95] The National Professional Teachers' Organisation of South Africa decried the looting and vandalism of 32 KwaZulu-Natal schools, one of which burned down, as contemptible.[96] In Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal, a crematorium was completely destroyed.[97] 
The Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar spoke to Dr. Naledi Pandor, Minister of International Relations and Cooperation to express his concern with regards to reports of Indian South Africans being targeted by looters.[110][111] 
Former South African president Jacob Zuma was charged with corruption in March 2018, mainly in connection with the South African Arms Deal, known as the "Strategic Defence Package" worth R30 billion (equal to US$2.5 billion or £2 billion).[31] The legal battle has continued since then, with Zuma's legal team attempting to have the charges dismissed and appealing for more time to prepare. 
During the trial proceedings, Zuma has been repeatedly absent from the court, citing medical reasons and lack of funds.[32] The case has proceeded into the Constitutional Court.[33] 
In terms of the Use of Official Languages Act, Act No. 12 of 2012, all government departments and government entities must have a language policy that states which languages are considered the official languages of that entity, and each language policy must also specify how that department or entity intends to communicate with people whose language of choice is "South African sign language".[20] 
According to the South African Schools Act, Act 84 of 1996, all schools must have a language policy, and that when selecting languages for such a policy, a "recognised Sign Language" should be evaluated as if it has official language status along with the other eleven official languages.[21] 
South African Sign Language (SASL, Afrikaans: Suid-Afrikaanse Gebaretaal) is the primary sign language used by deaf people in South Africa. 
The South African government added a National Language Unit for South African Sign Language in 2001.[2] SASL is not the only manual language used in South Africa,[3][4] but it is the language that is being promoted as the language to be used by the Deaf in South Africa,[5] although Deaf peoples in South Africa historically do not form a single group. 
The number of deaf people in South Africa (600,000 deaf and 1.4 million people with hearing loss)[23] does not give an accurate depiction of the number of people who communicate in South African Sign Language. 
There is currently no estimate for the number of people who communicate in South African Sign Language in South Africa. 
Estimates vary greatly, from 700,000 to 2 million users.[2] A request was made to the Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa) to measure this as part of the 2011 census.[needs update] 
Some words which are often fingerspelled tend to become signs in their own right (becoming "frozen"), following linguistic transformation processes such as alphanumeric incorporation and abbreviation. For instance, one of the sign-names for Cape Town uses incorporated fingerspelled letters C.T. ( transition from handshape for letter 'C' to letter 'T' of both wrists with rotation on an horizontal axis). 
The month of July is often abbreviated as 'J-L-Y'. 
Fingerspelling words is not a substitute for using existing signs: it takes longer to sign and it is harder to perceive. 
If the fingerspelled word is a borrowing, fingerspelling depends on both users having knowledge of the oral language (English, Sotho, Afrikaans etc.). 
Although proper names (such as a person's name, a company name) are often fingerspelled, it is often a temporary measure until the Deaf community agrees on a Sign name replacement. 
In 1995, the previous South African National Council for the Deaf (SANCD) was transformed into the Deaf Federation of South Africa (DeafSA),[6] which resulted in a radical policy change in matters for Deaf people in South Africa, such as the development and adoption of a single sign language and the promotion of sign language over oralism. 
Schools for the deaf have remained largely untransformed, however, and different schools for Deaf children in South African still use different sign language systems, and at a number of schools for the Deaf the use of any sign language is either discouraged or simply not taught.[7] There are as many as twelve different systems of signed oral language in South Africa.[8] 
Sign names are specific signs which are associated with proper names (a location, a person, an organisation). Sign names are often chosen based on a salient physical property. 
For instance, the sign name for Nelson Mandela is signed using a flat B-hand that follows a hair-line over the head. The sign name for the bank ABSA is made with both hands following the movement implied in the company corporate logo. 
South Africa is one of a few countries to have legal recognition of sign language.[25] There is presumably some regional variation, but signers from across the country can readily understand each other, as demonstrated for example at the annual Deaf Forum. 
It is commonly believed among South Africans, even among Deaf South Africans, that different language communities have different sign languages. This is evidently the result of the Deaf not being able to understand sign-language interpreters from other communities. 
However, this is because such "interpreters" do not actually use sign language, but rather Signed English, Signed Xhosa, etc., and only those who have been schooled in these artificial codes can understand them. (See manually coded language in South Africa.) 
SASL is the sign language that is used during television news casts in South Africa. 
Sign language is also used in the South African parliament, but different sign language interpreters are known to use different signs for the same concepts.[9] There are around 40 schools for the Deaf in South Africa, most using a variety of SASL. 
By 2011, there were 84 SASL interpreters on DeafSA's interpreter register, including 43 without any training, 31 who have completed 240 study hours of interpreter training, and 10 who have gained an additional 3 years' experience and completed a further 480 study hours.[12] A total of 7 SASL interpreters have actually been accredited by SATI/DeafSA.[13] SASL interpreters can apply for accreditation without having completed any formal training in SASL.[14]

Sekgala was born in Soweto, a township in the suburbs of Johannesburg.[2][3] He was raised by his grandmother in a settlement near Hammanskraal, in what was then the rural Bantustan (or "homeland") of KwaNdebele,[3] 40 km north of the city of Pretoria.[3][4] 
He studied photography at Market Photo Workshop in Johannesburg from 2007 to 2008. 
His photographs were, in the words of Hannah Abel-Hirsch writing in the British Journal of Photography, "united by their exploration of the notion of home, and the social, political, or economic conditions that may shape our relationship to it."[1] 
In 2012 Sekgala and Philippe Chancel "travelled to Magopa to investigate the problem of contemporary restitution of land in the so-called Black Spots, from which black South Africans were expelled under the apartheid-era “forced removals” programme".[5] In 2013 he lived in Kreuzberg in Berlin for a year-long residency at Künstlerhaus Bethanien[6] and undertook a two month residency at HIWAR/Durant Al Funun in Amman, Jordan.[6] 
He committed suicide on 15 October 2014, aged 33, a few months after the death of his grandmother.[1][2][7] He had a son and a daughter.[1]

On many occasions spanning over a century, leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) have taught that adherents should not masturbate as part of obedience to the code of conduct known as the law of chastity.[1]:80–127[2][3] The LDS Church places great emphasis on the law of chastity. 
Commitment to live the law of chastity is required for baptism,[4] and adherence is required to receive a temple recommend,[5] and is part of the temple endowment ceremony covenants devout participants promise by oath to keep.[6][7] While serving as church president, Spencer W. Kimball taught that the law of chastity includes "masturbation ... and every hidden and secret sin and all unholy and impure thoughts and practices."[8] Before serving full-time missions, young adults are required to abandon the practice as it is believed to be a gateway sin that dulls sensitivity to the guidance of the Holy Ghost.[9][10] The first recorded public mention of masturbation by a general church leader to a broad audience was in 1952 by apostle J. Reuben Clark,[11][12] and recent notable mentions include ones in 2013,[13] 2016,[14] and a 2019 update to the Missionary Handbook.[15] 
1871 – First Presidency member Daniel H. Wells told a group of church leaders that many of their young men had a masturbation habit (called "self-abuse", "self-pollution", and "onanism") that was a great sin and would prevent marriage and lead to insanity and an early death.[21]:415 1883 – The First Presidency and apostles spoke at length with stake presidents about the "self-pollution of both sexes" in the first Mormon reference to female masturbation.[21]:418 
Mandisa Sibongile Mashego (born 26 August 1973) is a South African politician and feminist. A former member of the Economic Freedom Fighters, she served as the party's provincial chairperson in Gauteng from 2018 to 2020. 
She was also a Member of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature from 2014 to 2020.[1] 
In December 2019 at the EFF's national elective conference, Mashego opposed Marshall Dlamini for the position of Secretary-General. 
Her opposition to Dlamini caused tensions between her and party leader Julius Malema.[6] Malema later suggested in a tweet, which caused speculation, that Mashego was planning on defecting to former Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba's party.[7] 
In February 2020, the Sunday World newspaper reported that Mashego had resigned as provincial chairperson and as a Member of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. 
The EFF disputed this claim and Mashego later denied that she had resigned.[8][9][10] 
On 31 March 2020, Mashego resigned as EFF provincial chairperson and also from the provincial legislature.[11] Deputy chairperson Itani Mukwevho was named her successor.[12][13] In August 2020, Mashego made an appearance at the launch of Mashaba's political party, ActionSA.[14] 
In January 2021, Mashego announced that she had joined the Abantu Batho Congress.[15] 
Mashego has not been married and has one daughter.[16] 
Mashego was born in King William's Town, Cape Province, to a black mother and a white father. 
She grew up in the Mayfern township of Nelspruit. 
She obtained a B-Tech in Public Relations from the Durban University of Technology.[2] 
Mashego joined the African National Congress (ANC) while still a student. 
She left the ANC in 2012 and soon joined the EFF. 
She was elected as a Member of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature in 2014 and the following year, she was appointed acting provincial chairperson of the EFF following the resignation of Zorro Boshielo. 
Mashego was elected provincial chairperson for a full term in 2018 and consequently became the party's second elected female provincial chairperson.[3] 
Mashego describes herself as a feminist and an opponent of patriarchy. 
She said in an interview with the Mail & Guardian that the replacement of the party's first female provincial chairperson, Betty Diale, "saddened" her.[4]

Mandisa Monakali and Litha Musyimi-Ogana the Regional Director of The African Center for Empowerment in Kenya organized the Women's Peace Train during the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), August 27-September 4, 2002. 
The Women's Peace Train journeyed from Rwanda to South Africa. 
Women from several African countries escorted the Peace Train to advocate for and demand an end to wars and conflict in their countries. 
The Peace Train's goal as stated in the invitations they sent out; "To pass on a strong message to the continent′s leaders, war mongers, armies, guerrillas, arms traders and dealers in the African continent that women want peace and stability for their children and future generations and call upon ring leaders and perpetrators of these wars to end them forthwith." 
The message to the WSSD was that there can be do sustainable development without addressing peace. 
The Africa Women's Peace Train was launched in Kampala, Uganda on August 15 with a ceremony where a Peace Torch was received. 
The Peace Train traveled through Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique, Botswana and ending in Johannesburg, South Africa for the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) on 25 August 2002.[13][14] [15][16] She is a member of Women's Environment and Development Organization (WEDO), and organized the Women's Action Tent at the World's Summit on Sustainable Development.[17] 
Mandisa participates yearly at the United Nations Conference on the Status of Women representing South Africa at this global conference that is held every year. The 2015 Conference on The Status of Women's CSW59 marked the anniversary of the Beijing Conference. 
The Beijing conference which was held in 1995. 
She stated at the CSW59; “For us Beijing +20 was not about UN, it was about our daily lives as South African women and you could see what was happening now in the country. The number of women we have in construction for instance has increased,” Mandisa Monakali.[18] She has participated in the 2005 and 2015 Beijing Conferences. 
The 1995 conference in Beijing was the Fourth World Conference on Women sponsored by the United Nations. 
The first global conference on women was held in Mexico City in 1975, 2nd in 1980 in Copenhagen, the third conference was held in Nairobi in 1985, and the fourth in Beijing in 1995. 
The conference having a series of five year reviews.

Thomas founded Black Nonbelievers, Inc. in 2011, as a non-profit,[15] secular fellowship.[19][3] Its goals include eliminating stigma, increasing visibility, and providing support and networking opportunities around non-belief in the African-American community.[5][7][6][8] The organization's leadership is mostly female, and includes LGBTQ representation,[20] and it has chapters in ten U.S. cities.[21] It partners with other secular organizations including African Americans for Humanism, Openly Secular and the Freedom From Religion Foundation.[15][14] 
Mandisa Lateefah Thomas (born 1976)[citation needed] is the founder and president of Black Nonbelievers Inc. 
She has spoken at secular conferences and events, and has promoted the group's agenda in media outlets. 
Thomas's upbringing was in a nonreligious, single-parent household, but she describes her grandmother as "staunchly religious".[1][2][3][4][5] At the age of twenty-one, Thomas moved with her husband to Atlanta, where cultural factors made it difficult to lead a secular life.[6] This experience led her to found Black Nonbelievers.[5][3] 
She considers religion, and Christianity in particular, to have been ingrained into the African-American identity by force.[5][7][8] 
Thomas spoke at the 2013 National Convention of American Atheists.[9] That same year she organized the Blackout Secular Rally in New York, the United States' first outdoor event headlined by nontheists of color, and the first secular rally celebrating racial diversity.[10][11] She credits Ayanna Watson with helping develop the idea after the success of the 2012 Reason Rally.[12] 
In 2017, Thomas was recognized by name in a bill (SCR-79) introduced by state Senator Richard Pan, and adopted by the California State Senate, proclaiming October 15, 2017 as the 16th annual celebration of California Freethought Day.[13]

She was a member of the African National Congress (ANC), Ntwanambi was the ANC's Chief Whip in the National Council of Provinces, the first woman to become chief whip, a position she held until she stepped down in 2014.[1][2] She served as a member of the National Council of Provinces, the upper house of the Parliament of South Africa, from 2008 until 2014.[1] Ntwanambi was also serving as a deputy president of the African National Congress Women's League (ANCWL) at the time of her death.[1] 
Ntwanambi was a founding member of both the South African Democratic Teachers Union (SADTU) and the United Women's Organisation (UWO).[1] She was also a member of the ANC's National Executive Committee. 
Nosipho Ntwanambi died following a long illness on Tuesday, July 8, 2014, at the age of 54.[1]

Makamba-Botya is also the deputy chairperson of the EFF in the province.[1][2] 
Soon after the unbanning of political parties and exiled freedom fighters constituting the liberation movement in 1990, Nosipho was elected as the chairperson of the African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) for the Uitenhage region. 
She continued her activist work and serving the people and community of Uitenhage and in 1994 was elected as the first councillor under the banner of the new democratically constituted Uitenhage Transitional Local Council for a period spanning five years until 1999. 
After this, she took time away from political life due to an illness but continued to volunteer as a teacher at the Ruth Dano crèche in Uitenhage. 
She subsequently passed away in May 2009 at the age of 71 years. She was peacefully laid to rest amongst her people on 23 May 2009 at the Kwanobuhle Cemetery with prominent ANC political figures in attendance.[2] 
The ANC regional offices in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape are named Florence Matomela House.[3] The artist Nombulelo Dassie created a sculpture of Florence Matomela.[4] A year long exhibition curated by Nomabaso Bedeshe was held at Red Location Museum honouring Florence Matomela, Nontuthuzelo Mabala, Veronica Sobukwe, Lilian Diedricks and Nosipho Dastile. The exhibition included the biographies and photographs of the five women.[5] 
Circle jerks often feature a competitive element, with the "winner" being the participant able to ejaculate first, last, or farthest depending on the pre-established rules.[1][2] They can serve as an introduction to sexual relations with other males, or as a sexual outlet at an age or situation when regular sexual activity with another person is not possible.[1] 
While circle jerks feature a homoerotic element, some analysts interpret adolescent boys' group activities such as circle jerks as an effort to establish heterosexual, masculine dominance within the group.[1][2][3] However, American sociologist Bernard Lefkowitz asserts that what actually motivates participation is the desire for friends to witness and acknowledge one's sexual prowess, helping to counter teenage feelings of inadequacy related to sexual activity.[3] 
Christmas tree decorated with sex toys, Milan, Italy, 2013[1] 
Anal vibrators are designed to be inserted into the rectum, which may stimulate the prostate in men. 
The safest ones have a flared base which remains outside the body, that prevents the toy from becoming irretrievable. 
Bullet vibrators are small, bullet-shaped vibrators that can be used for direct stimulation or inserted into other sex toys to increase stimulation. 
Some are sold with stretchy loops for attachment as a finger toy or cock ring. 
G-spot vibrators are curved at one end to facilitate stimulation of the female G-spot. 
P-spot vibrators are curved at one end to facilitate stimulation of the male P-spot. 
Luxury vibrators have an increased focus on design and the use of expensive materials that appeal to a more upscale fashion market. 
The rabbit vibrator, of which there are several variations, is a popular female sex toy popularized by the television series Sex and the City.[3] It comprises an insertable shaft which often has additional functionality, such as rotation and internal beads or a thrusting action. 
Attached to the shaft is a vibrating clitoral stimulator. 
For most rabbit vibrators this comes in the form of "bunny ears" which sit each side of the clitoris. 
Vibrator wands, such as the Hitachi Magic Wand, are large vibrators that generally plug into an electrical outlet (versus operating on battery power) and are often marketed as back massagers.[4] They are able to produce far more powerful vibration than most battery-powered vibrators.[4] Various attachments made of silicone or a rubber material allow the toy to be used penetratively, or give the toy more interesting texture.[4][5] Sybians are dual-area vibrators in the form of a clitoral stimulator and vaginal stimulator, designed to stimulate the two erogenous zones simultaneously and independently.

Greek dildos were often made out of leather stuffed with wool in order to give it varying degrees of thickness and firmness. 
They were often lubricated with olive oil, and used for sexual practice and other activities. 
The Greeks were also one of the first groups to use the term “toy” in reference to a dildo.[1] Dildos may be seen in some examples of ancient Greek vase art. 
Some pieces show their use in group sex or in solitary female masturbation.[25] One vessel, of about the sixth century BCE, depicts a scene in which a woman bends over to perform oral sex on a man, while another man is about to thrust a dildo into her anus.[26] shop. 
Page DuBois, a classicist and feminist theorist, suggests that dildos were present in Greek art because the ancient Greek male imagination found it difficult to conceive of sex taking place without penetration. 
Therefore, female masturbation or sex between women required an artificial phallus to be used.[1] Greek dildos were often made out of leather stuffed with wool in order to give it varying degrees of thickness and firmness. 
They were often lubricated with olive oil, and used for sexual practice and other activities. 
The Greeks were also one of the first groups to use the term “toy” in reference to a dildo.[2] 
METRO I beg you, don't lie, dear Corrioto: who was the man who stitched for you this bright red dildo?[28] 
She eventually discovers the maker to be a man called Kerdon, who hides his trade by the front of being a cobbler, and leaves to seek him out. 
Metro and Kerdon are main characters in the next play in the sequence, Mime VII, when she visits his shop. 
In the early 1590s, the English playwright Thomas Nashe wrote a poem known as The Choise of Valentines, Nashe's Dildo or The Merrie Ballad of Nashe his Dildo. 
This was not printed at the time, due to its obscenity[31] but it was still widely circulated and made Nashe's name notorious.[2] The poem describes a visit to a brothel by a man called "Tomalin"; he is searching for his sweetheart, Francis, who has become a prostitute. 
The only way he can see her is to hire her. 
However, she resorts to using a glass dildo as he finds himself unable to perform sexually to her satisfaction.[32] 
Another form of sex toys for both men and women are those for erotic electrostimulation. 
Erotic electrostimulation refers to the act of using electricity for sexual stimulation.By the mid 1970s, medical transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machines were widely available. 
The machines work by stimulating nerve endings with electricity, sending signals of stimulation to the brain. Electrostimulation works off this same principle, when the brain received a signal of stimulation from the genitals, pleasure hormones are released. 
Erotic furniture is furniture specially shaped for comfort, penetration levels, and stimulation. 
Also known as sex furniture, it is any form of furniture that can act as an aid to sexual activity. 
While almost anything can be used for this purpose, the most common form of furniture employed for sexual activity is the bed, but couches and sofas come a close second. These are not strictly erotic furniture, as their primary use is not erotic. 
Since frot is a non-penetrative sex act, the risk of passing a sexually transmitted infection (STI/STD) that requires direct contact between the mucous membranes and pre-ejaculate or semen is reduced. 
HIV is among the infections that require such direct contact, and research indicates that there is no risk of HIV transmission via frot.[1][9] However, frot can still transmit other sexually transmitted infections, such as HPV (which can cause genital warts) and pubic lice (crabs).[3][3] Vaccines are available against HPV. 
Frot or frotting(slang for frottage; ult. from the French verb frotter, "to rub") is a non-penetrative form of male-to-male sexual activity that usually involves direct penis-to-penis contact.[1] The term was popularized by gay men activists who disparaged the practice of anal sex,[1][2] but has since evolved to encompass a variety of preferences for the act, which may or may not imply particular attitudes towards other sexual activities. 
Owing to its non-penetrative character, frot has the safe sex advantage of minimizing the transmission risk for HIV/AIDS; however, it still carries the risk of skin-to-skin sexually transmitted infections, such as HPV and pubic lice (crabs), both of which can be transmitted even when lesions are not visible.[3][4] 
A 2011 survey of gay and bisexual men by the Journal of Sexual Medicine found that out of over 1,300 different combinations of sexual acts practiced, the most common, at 16% of all encounters, was "holding their partner romantically, kissing partner on mouth, solo masturbation, masturbating partner, masturbation by partner, and genital–genital contact."[20] 
Genital–genital rubbing has been observed between males of other animals as well. Among bonobos, frottage frequently occurs when two males hang from a tree limb and engage in penis fencing; it also occurs while two males are in the missionary position.[21][22] 
The modern definition of frot emerged in a context of a debate about the status of anal sex within the gay male community; some in the anti-anal, pro-frot camp insist that anal sex ought to be avoided altogether.[1] One view argued that the popularity of anal sex would decline, presumably with a corresponding drop in HIV rates, if gay men could somehow be persuaded to stop thinking of anal sex as a "vanilla" practice, but rather as something "kinky" and not-quite-respectable—as was the case in the 1950s and 1960s, when gay men who preferred to do only mutual masturbation and fellatio sometimes used the disparaging slang term brownie queen for aficionados of anal sex.[2] 
Gay activist Bill Weintraub began to heavily promote and recommend the gender-specific meaning of "penis-to-penis rubbing" as frot on Internet forums sometime in the late 1990s, and said he coined the term. 
"I don't use the word 'frottage,' because it is an ersatz French word which can indicate any sort of erotic rubbing," he stated. 
"Frot, by contrast, is always phallus-to-phallus sex." 
Weintraub believes that is what actual sex is – genital-genital contact.[5] 
Alternative terms for frot include frictation, which can refer to the wider meaning of frottage[6] but also penis-penis sex specifically,[7] sword-fighting, Oxford style, Princeton rub, and Ivy League rub.[3] 
The female version of frotting is called tribbing, which also means "rubbing [genitals]" and is derived from Greek.[8] 
Fellatio can be sexually arousing for both participants, and males who receive fellatio commonly experience orgasm and ejaculation of semen during the act.[1][2] People may use fellatio as foreplay to sexually arouse their sex partner before vaginal or anal intercourse, or other sexual activity,[3][3] or they may use it as an erotic and physically intimate act in its own right.[3][4] The sex partner may be of either sex. 
When the penis is thrust into someone's mouth, it may be called irrumatio, though the term is rarely used.[16] 
Deep-throating is a sexual act in which a person takes a partner's entire erect penis into the mouth and throat. 
The technique and term became popularized by the 1972 pornographic film Deep Throat. 
Generally, the person receiving fellatio is in control.[21][22] For deep-throating, the penis has to be long enough so that it can reach the back of the giver's throat.[21] 
Deep-throating can be difficult, due to the natural gag reflex triggered when the soft palate is touched.[23][24] People have different sensitivities to this reflex, and with practice, some people learn to suppress it. 
Deep-throating leads to an entirely different kind of oral stimulation in comparison to regular fellatio: the tongue is immobilized during deep-throating and sucking becomes impossible;[25] the glans penis can be intensely stimulated by the tightness of the pharynx. 
Fellatio is sometimes practiced when penile penetration would create a physical difficulty for a sex partner. 
For example, it may be practiced during pregnancy instead of vaginal intercourse by couples wishing to engage in intimate sexual activity while avoiding the difficulty of vaginal intercourse during later stages of pregnancy.[26] 
Fellatio (also known as fellation,[1] and in slang as blowjob, BJ, giving head, or sucking off)[2] is an oral sex act involving a person stimulating the penis of another person by using the mouth, throat, or both.[3][4] Oral stimulation of the scrotum may also be termed fellatio,[5][6] or colloquially as teabagging.[7] If fellatio is performed on oneself, the act is called autofellatio. 
Chlamydia, human papillomavirus (HPV), gonorrhea, herpes, hepatitis (multiple strains), and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs) can be transmitted through oral sex.[1][2][27] Any sexual exchange of bodily fluids with a person infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, poses a risk of infection. 
Risk of STI infection, however, is generally considered significantly lower for oral sex than for vaginal or anal sex, with HIV transmission considered the lowest risk with regard to oral sex.[10][4][28][29] 
Links have been reported between oral sex and oral cancer with HPV-infected people.[31] A 2005 research study suggested that performing unprotected oral sex on a person infected with HPV might increase the risk of oral cancer. 
The study found that 36 percent of the cancer patients had HPV compared to only 1 percent of the healthy control group.[32] 
Oral sex is commonly used as a means of preserving virginity, especially among heterosexual pairings; this is sometimes termed technical virginity (which additionally includes anal sex, mutual masturbation and other non-penetrative sex acts, but excludes penile-vaginal sex).[1][2][3][40] The concept of "technical virginity" or sexual abstinence through oral sex is particularly popular among teenagers in the United States,[14][5][41] including with regard to teenage girls who not only fellate their boyfriends to preserve their virginities, but also to create and maintain intimacy or to avoid pregnancy.[14] Other reasons given for the practice among teenage girls are peer-group pressure and as their introduction to sexual activity.[14] Additionally, gay males may regard fellatio as a way of maintaining their virginities, with penile-anal penetration defined as resulting in virginity loss, while other gay males may define fellatio as their main form of sexual activity.[12][7] 
Practice 
Heteroflexibility is a form of a sexual orientation or situational sexual behavior characterized by minimal homosexual activity in an otherwise primarily heterosexual orientation, which may or may not distinguish it from bisexuality. 
It has been characterized as "mostly straight".[1] Although sometimes equated with bi-curiosity to describe a broad continuum of sexual orientation between heterosexuality and bisexuality,[2] other authors distinguish heteroflexibility as lacking the "wish to experiment with ... sexuality" implied by the bi-curious label.[3] The corresponding situation in which homosexual activity predominates has also been described, termed homoflexibility.[4] 
National surveys in the U.S. and Canada show that 3 to 4 percent of male teenagers, when given the choice to select a term that best describes their sexual feelings, desires, and behaviors, opt for "mostly" or "predominantly" heterosexual. 
With "100% heterosexual" being the largest assumed identity, "mostly-heterosexual" was the first runner up in self-identification.[5] Of the 160 men interviewed for a study in 2008 and 2009, nearly one in eight reported same-sex attractions, fantasies, and crushes. 
The majority had these feelings since high school; a few others developed them more recently. 
And in a national sample of young men whose average age was 22, the "mostly straight" proportion increased when they completed the same survey six years later. 
An even higher percentage of post-high-school young-adult men in the U.S. and in a handful of other countries (including New Zealand and Norway) make the same choice.[6] 
Unlike "bisexual until graduation" and similar pejoratives, heteroflexibility is typically considered to have a positive connotation, and is often a self-applied label, although use of the term as a pop-culture slur has been attested.[13] 
Social scientists Hoy and London point out that some men who have occasional sex with other men nevertheless identify as heterosexual. 
They may feel that occasional sex with men is a result of female unavailability, or that their same-sex attraction is infrequent enough to not affect their identity. 
They may claim that while they feel romantically, physically, and emotionally attracted to women, their attraction to men is purely sexual, lacking any emotional attraction. A heteroflexible management strategy for these men is to interpret their sexual practices with women to be more important than their sexual encounters with men. 
They may also see themselves as masculine, while associating a same-sex-attracted identity with femininity. 
Some of the men and women who experience same sex encounters while identifying as heterosexual do so to avoid the negative social consequences that come with identifying as a member of the LGBT community.[7] 
Growth of the penis both before birth and during childhood and puberty is strongly influenced by testosterone and, to a lesser degree, the growth hormone. 
However, later endogenous hormones mainly have value in the treatment of micropenis caused by hormone deficiencies, such as hypopituitarism or hypogonadism.[citation needed] 
Testosterone treatment is resumed in adolescence only for boys with hypogonadism. 
Penile growth is completed at the end of puberty, similar to the completion of height growth, and provision of extra testosterone to post-pubertal adults produces little or no further growth.[citation needed] 
In extreme cases of micropenis, there is barely any shaft, and the glans appears to sit almost on the pubic skin. 
From the 1960s until the late 1970s, it was common for sex reassignment and surgery to be recommended. 
This was especially likely if evidence suggested that response to additional testosterone and pubertal testosterone would be poor. 
With parental acceptance, the boy would be reassigned and renamed as a girl, and surgery performed to remove the testes and construct an artificial vagina. 
This was based on the now-questioned idea that gender identity was shaped entirely from socialization, and that a man with a small penis can find no acceptable place in society.[citation needed] 
Johns Hopkins Hospital, the center most known for this approach, performed twelve such reassignments from 1960 to 1980, most notably[citation needed] that of David Reimer (whose penis was destroyed by a circumcision accident), overseen by John Money. 
By the mid-1990s, reassignment was less often offered, and all three premises had been challenged. 
Former subjects of such surgery, vocal about their dissatisfaction with the adult outcome, played a large part in discouraging this practice. 
Sexual reassignment is rarely performed today for severe micropenis (although the question of raising the boy as a girl is sometimes still discussed).[6] 
Micropenis is an unusually small penis. 
A common criterion is a dorsal (measured on top) erect penile length of at least 2.5 standard deviations smaller than the mean human penis size,[1] or smaller than about 7 cm (2+3⁄4 in) for an adult when compared with an average erection of 12.5 cm (5 in).[2] The condition is usually recognized shortly after birth. 
The term is most often used medically when the rest of the penis, scrotum, and perineum are without ambiguity, such as hypospadias. Micropenis occurs in about 0.6% of males.[2] 
Of the abnormal conditions associated with micropenis, most are conditions of reduced prenatal androgen production or effect, such as abnormal testicular development (testicular dysgenesis), Klinefelter syndrome, Leydig cell hypoplasia, specific defects of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone synthesis (17,20-lyase deficiency, 5α-reductase deficiency), androgen insensitivity syndromes, inadequate pituitary stimulation (gonadotropin deficiency), and other forms of congenital hypogonadism. 
Micropenis can also occur as part of many genetic malformation syndromes that do not involve the sex chromosomes. 
It is sometimes a sign of congenital growth-hormone deficiency or congenital hypopituitarism. Several homeobox genes affect penis and digit size without detectable hormone abnormalities.[citation needed] 
In addition, in utero exposure to some estrogen based fertility drugs like diethylstilbestrol (DES) has been linked to genital abnormalities or a smaller than normal penis.[3] 
The more recent and specific sense of the word art as an abbreviation for creative art or fine art emerged in the early 17th century.[17] Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or finer work of art. 
Within this latter sense, the word art may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (art as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce artworks (art as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience). 
Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. 
Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. 
For some scholars, such as Kant, the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.[18] 
Art may be characterized in terms of mimesis (its representation of reality), narrative (storytelling), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. 
During the Romantic period, art came to be seen as "a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science".[27] 
Art is a diverse range of (and products of) human activities involving creative imagination to express technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas.[1][2][3] 
In the perspective of the history of art,[10] artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early pre-historic art to contemporary art; however, some theorists feel that the typical concept of "artistic works" fits less well outside modern Western societies.[11] One early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to "skill" or "craft", as associated with words such as "artisan". English words derived from this meaning include artifact, artificial, artifice, medical arts, and military arts. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its etymology. 
Takunda Mafika played the Mbira, an African music instrument, famous among the Shona people of Zimbabwe. He taught the mbira to individuals, local schools and colleges and held numerous workshops and performances in Zimbabwe, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Poland and Namibia.[1] With his band he founded, called Tru Bantu, he recorded the album Dzimwe Nguva, that has sold both locally and internationally. 
He had been working with many well known Zimbabwean artists like Willom Tight, Chiwoniso, Alexio, Mafriq, Sebede, Sam & Selmor Mtukudzi, among others.[2] Takunda Mafika was also the co-founder and manager of the Mbira Society Zimbabwe. 
Takunda ( nicknamed TK) was a former Junior Governor in the year 2000's Children's Parliament. 
He had a degree in Music and Musicology earned from the Midlands State University in Zimbabwe. 
Since 2009 Taku worked as a UNESCO Schools coordinator within the framework of education for sustainable development. 
In 2010 Taku was invited to join an international music tour organized by the Jesuit Mission Nuremberg, Germany, along with musicians from Europe, Asia, South America and Africa.[3] 
Through his music and activities Taku often addressed social issues in Zimbabwe as well as subjects of democracy and freedom. 
He was a known advocate for a peaceful and sustainable development in Zimbabwe.[4] Apart from his commitment as a UNESCO teacher[5] he was the country coordinator for The Global Experience, an international NGO based in Münster, Germany.[6] He was invited on numerous occasions to Germany to participate in conferences and trainings in matters of youth participation, intercultural learning and media competency.[7] 
Taku was taken to hospital after suffering from a stroke on 1 October 2011. 
He initially showed signs of recovering from a brain operation on 7 October, but his condition rapidly declined during the night of 11 October. 
Taku died during the early hours of 12 October 2011.[8] Taku is survived by a daughter who stays in Chivhu, his home town. 
Tapfuma Gutsa (born 1956) is a Zimbabwean sculptor.[1][2][3]

Ntombikayise (Ntombi) Priscilla Kubheka is a former South African anti-apartheid activist and a member of the armed wing of the ANC, Umkhonto we Sizwe. 
She died at the age of 41 in 1987 after being abducted and interrogated by the South African security forces due to her role as a co-ordinator for Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK). 
Kubheka's death was highly disputed during the hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, in which South African Police officials originally claimed they were not responsible for her death. 
Her body was exhumed in May 1997, near KwaDukuza, revealing that Kubheka had died of gunshot wounds.[1] 
Kubheka lived in KwaMashu, a township north of Durban. 
She acted as a co-ordinator for externally and internally trained MK members living in KwaMashu. 
Wanting to obtain information on the arrival of four MK members from Swaziland, Vlakplaas police officers combined their resources with the Durban security branch to infiltrate Kubheka's network. 
Under the command of Captain Adriaan David Baker working with the Port Natal Security Branch, two C1/Vlakplaas askaris, Simon Radebe and Xola Frank ‘Jimmy’ Mbane, were tasked to make contact with her. Pretending to be MK members, they offered to help her accommodate activists from Swaziland. In May 1987, Mr Mbane drove Ms Kubheka to Battery Beach from where she was abducted by the Port Natal team. 
She was blindfolded, bound and taken to an abandoned shooting range at Winkelspruit, south of Durban. 
Still blindfolded, she was then subjected to interrogation by the Port Natal Security Branch. This team consisted of Colonel Andy Taylor, Captain Hentie Botha, Sergeant Laurance ‘Laurie’ Wasserman, Sergeant Cassie van der Westhuizen, Joe Coetzer and Warrant Officer ‘Bossie’ Basson.[2] 
During amnesty hearings conducted by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, contrasting details surrounding Kubheka's death were given by those involved in her death . 
Captain Botha stated the interrogation was conducted largely in Zulu by Colonel Taylor, during which he struck Ms Kubheka across the back with a sjambok. According to Captain Botha, this was not a severe assault but intended to convey the gravity of the situation and persuade her to co-operate with them. Captain Botha testified that the interrogation lasted approximately fifteen to twenty minutes and that Taylor struck her approximately ten to fifteen times with a sjambok. 
Sergeant van der Westhuizen's testimony suggests that the interrogation lasted an hour. Both of these accounts were disputed by Mbane who alleged that the interrogation lasted for approximately two hours, during which he could hear her screams of pain from outside. Botha and other applicants testified that, during the course of the interrogation, Ms Kubheka agreed to co-operate with them but that she suddenly died of a heart attack. 
They claimed she grabbed her chest and fell over, experiencing a heart attack due to her being overweight. 
Ms Kubheka's dead body was dumped near the Bhambayi informal settlement, some distance away from her home by Sergeants Wasserman and Salman Gerhardus du Preez. Captain Botha established that her family was unaware of her death and appeared to believe that she had gone into exile. 
It was subsequently rumoured that she had left the country for Mozambique because of the attentions of the Security Branch.

Gender discusses the social aspects of womanhood and manhood, as opposed to biological sex. 
Intersex people are individuals born with any of several sex characteristics including chromosome patterns, gonads, or genitals that, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, "do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies".[1][2] Though the range of atypical sex characteristics may be obvious from birth through the presence of physically ambiguous genitalia, in other instances, atypical characteristics may go unnoticed, presenting as ambiguous internal reproductive organs or atypical chromosomes that may remain unknown to an individual all of their life.[3] 
Sex assignment at birth usually aligns with a child's anatomical sex and phenotype. 
The number of births with ambiguous genitals is in the range of 0.02% to 0.05%.[4] Other conditions involve atypical chromosomes, gonads, or hormones.[2][6] Some persons may be assigned and raised as a girl or boy but then identify with another gender later in life, while most continue to identify with their assigned sex.[7][8][9] The number of births where the baby is intersex has been reported differently depending on who reports and which definition of intersex is used. 
Anne Fausto-Sterling and her co-authors suggest that the prevalence of ″nondimorphic sexual development″ might be as high as 1.7%, including conditions which clinicians do not recognize as intersex.[7][8] In those ″conditions in which chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female [..] the true prevalence of intersex is seen to be about 0.018%, almost 100 times lower than Fausto-Sterling's estimate of 1.7%″,[5][12] Leonard Sax reports.[13] 
The words used to describe intersex people are contested, and change over time and place. 
Intersex people were previously referred to as "hermaphrodites" or "congenital eunuchs".[14][15] In the 19th and 20th centuries, some medical experts devised new nomenclature in an attempt to classify the characteristics that they had observed, the first attempt to create a taxonomic classification system of intersex conditions. 
Intersex people were categorized as either having "true hermaphroditism", "female pseudohermaphroditism", or "male pseudohermaphroditism".[16] These terms are no longer used, and terms including the word "hermaphrodite" are considered to be misleading, stigmatizing, and scientifically specious in reference to humans.[17] In biology, the term hermaphrodite is used to describe an organism that can produce both male and female gametes.[18][19] 
The Tumbuka language is a Bantu language which is spoken in the Northern Region of Malawi and also in the Lundazi district of Zambia.[3] It is also known as Chitumbuka or Citumbuka — the chi- prefix in front of Tumbuka means "the language of the", and is understood in this case to mean "the language of (the Tumbuka people)". Tumbuka belongs to the same language group (Guthrie Zone N) as Chewa and Sena.[4] 
Nili makola, kwali imwe? = I am fine, how are you? Mwatandala uli? = Good afternoon. (How did you spend the day?) 
Monile = somewhat more formal than "Hi". Perhaps best translated as "Greetings". Tionanenge = We shall meet again. 
ti-ku-phika sî:ma 'we are cooking porridge' 
The World Almanac (1998) estimates that there are approximately 2,000,000 Tumbuka speakers, though other sources estimate a much smaller number. 
The majority of Tumbuka speakers are said to live in Malawi.[1] Tumbuka is the most widely spoken of the languages of Northern Malawi, especially in the Rumphi, Mzuzu, and Mzimba districts.[5] 
ku-limirâ-so ngô:mâ? 'are you also weeding the maize?' 
As is usual with Bantu languages, Tumbuka nouns are grouped into different noun classes according to their singular and plural prefixes. 
Each class of noun has its own adjective, pronoun, and verb agreements, known as 'concords'. Where the agreements disagree with the prefix, the agreements take precedence in deciding the class of noun. 
For example, the noun katundu 'possessions', despite having the prefix ka-, is placed in class 1, since one says katundu uyu 'these possessions' using the class 1 demonstrative uyu. 
Malawians themselves (e.g. in the University of Malawi's Citumbuka dictionary) refer to the noun classes by traditional names such as "Mu-Ŵa-"; Bantu specialists, however, refer to the classes by numbers (1/2 etc.) corresponding to the noun-classes of other Bantu languages. 
Occasionally nouns do not correspond to the classes below, e.g. fumu 'chief' (class 9) irregularly has a plural mafumu in class 6. 
There are substantial differences between the form of Tumbuka spoken in urban areas of Malawi (which borrows some words from Swahili and Chewa) and the "village" or "deep" Tumbuka spoken in villages. The Rumphi variant is often regarded as the most "linguistically pure", and is sometimes called "real Tumbuka".[6] The Mzimba dialect has been strongly influenced by Zulu (chiNgoni),[7] even so far as to have clicks in words like chitha [ʇʰitʰa] "urinate", which do not occur in other dialects. 
The Tumbuka language suffered during the rule of President Hastings Kamuzu Banda, since in 1968 as a result of his one-nation, one-language policy it lost its status as an official language in Malawi. As a result, Tumbuka was removed from the school curriculum, the national radio, and the print media.[8] With the advent of multi-party democracy in 1994, Tumbuka programmes were started again on the radio, but the number of books and other publications in Tumbuka remains low.[9] 
Tariro Washe Mnangagwa (born 1986), is a Zimbabwean actress.[1] She is most notable for the role in the 2020 film Gonarezhou.

Taribo West (born 26 March 1974) is a Nigerian pastor and former professional footballer who played as a defender. 
He is best remembered for his various unusual and colourful hairstyles.[1][2] 
Primarily a centre-back, West was a physically commanding and powerful defender. 
Although he lacked significant pace, West was known for his ball-winning abilities, commitment, and hard-tackling style of play, as well as his forward surging runs.[42][43][44][45][46][47] 
A devout Christian, West admittedly used charms before games during his professional career as a footballer.[48] He eventually became a pastor after his footballing days.[49] In 2014, West founded a church called "Shelter in the Storm Miracle Ministries of All Nation" in Lagos.[50] 
In 2010, it was reported that West and other Nigerian internationals, such as Jay-Jay Okocha, Nwankwo Kanu and Obafemi Martins, were much older than they claimed to be.[51] In April 2013, Žarko Zečević, former FK Partizan general secretary, said that West is 12 years older than his claimed age.[52] Shortly afterwards, West denied the accusation.[53] 
Honours 
At international level, West made 42 caps for Nigeria between 1994 and 2005,[3] taking part in two World Cups and two African Championships.

Philani Bhekizizwe Lancelot Kubheka or Philani is a South African football striker who plies his trade with Malaysia premier League Negeri Sembilan FA. He is renowned for his trickery and explosive pace. 
Philani was strongly linked with a move to A-League club Adelaide United[1] but the deal did not go ahead because the club decided to sign Brazilian Cristiano instead. 
He was arrested on 3 occasions for his political activism[1] and in 2007 was very badly assaulted on one occasion suffering permanent damage to his left ear. 
He successfully sued the South African police for assault with the support of Amnesty International.[2] The police were ordered to pay Zungu and S'bu Zikode R165,000 in damages, seven years after the event.[3] In 2009 the police were reported to have fired live ammunition into his shack.[4] 
Dube-Ncube served as the mayor of the North Central council before it was merged into the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality in 2000. 
She then served as chief whip of the eThekwini council until her appointment as ambassador to the Czech Republic.[1] She was elected to the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature and the ANC appointed her as chief whip.[1] She held this position until July 2009, when premier Zweli Mkhize appointed her to the position of MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs.[1] Senzo Mchunu was elected premier in 2013, and she was kept in her position. 
Dube-Ncube remained in the position following Willies Mchunu's election as premier in May 2016.[2] 
In May 2019, she appointed MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs by newly elected premier Sihle Zikalala.[3] On 17 November 2020, Dube-Mncube was appointed MEC for Finance, replacing Ravi Pillay.[4] 
She represented her country in their Olympic debut at the 2016 Summer Olympics.[1][2] 
In the Olympic match versus Germany it was Makore who set up a goal that took their goalkeeper Almuth Schult by surprise. The ball was rebounded but Kudakwashe Basopo make it a goal leaving the score at 6–1 against Zimbabwe.[3] 
Luthando Mateza (born 8 February 1998) is a South African soccer player who plays as a midfielder for Steenberg United. 
Majola was one of the leading players in the Howa Bowl; he played in more matches than any other player, scored the second-most runs, and took the fifth-most wickets. Although he described himself as a cricketer, not a politician, he continued to campaign against the tokenism of black cricketers, and lobbied against the rebel tours of South Africa. 
Both apartheid and the sporting boycott formally ended in 1991, and the same year, Majola joined the United Cricket Board upon its foundation. 
As the director of amateur cricket, he was responsible for setting up a national development programme, and sought to create pathways for black Africans to be able to play cricket at every level of the game. 
He died of colon cancer, aged 47, in 2000. 
Khaya Majola was born on 17 May 1953 in the New Brighton township in Port Elizabeth, South Africa,[2][3] the eldest of five children of Eric and Milase Majola.[4] His family were black Africans in apartheid South Africa; his father was of Zulu descent, while his mother had mixed heritage; Scottish and Sotho.[5] Both his parents worked as teachers, and were heavily involved in sports; Eric played for the national African team in rugby and cricket, and they were strong believers in the community and character-forming benefits of sport for their children.[6] Milase recalled Khaya playing cricket with his father as a toddler; "Khaya would walk out the front door with this bat that was bigger than him."[7] Although Khaya's brothers played a variety of sports, particularly association football, Khaya's father kept him focused on cricket. 
He was viewed as the most talented of the Majola children, and the family would sometimes rise at 5 am to bowl at Khaya. 
As a pre-teen, Khaya occasionally played for his father's New Brighton Cricket Club when they were short of players.[8] 
Majola first attended Jarvis Gqamlana Lower, and then Johnson Marwanqa Higher primary schools; neither had significant sport schemes, and Majola continued to primarily develop his cricketing ability at home with his family. 
By the age of 11, he was already described by the Evening Post as "a star in Port Elizabeth"; by his teenage years his performances were noteworthy more weeks than not. 
He attended Cowan High School, where they played an inter-school cricket schedule against five other schools. 
Khaya recalled that during his time at Cowan, most weeks he was "scoring a fifty or taking wickets," playing for both school and club.[9] Despite his talent and success, Khaya developed a dislike for the game, partly due to the strictness of his father with regards to his development.[10] 
As an MEC of Community Safety, Security and Liaison, Shongwe was the political head of the provincial security structure.[11][12][13][14] 
On 24 February 2021, Shongwe was moved back to the Community Safety, Security and Liaison portfolio of the executive.[17] 
Shongwe was serving as the Mpumalanga MEC for Agriculture, Rural Development, Land and Environmental Affairs, a position he assumed after the 3 August 2016 local government elections when Mabuza reshuffled his cabinet and moved him from the security cluster to be the new agricultural MEC.[10] 
Sekuru Kaguvi[1] (Kagubi,[2] Kakubi), was a svikiro (medium), a nationalist leader in pre-colonial Zimbabwe, and a leader in the Shona rebellion of 1896-1897 against European rule, known as the First Chimurenga. 
The soubriquet "Kaguvi" was given to him because he was said to speak for the traditional Shona spirit Mwari. 
When the rebellion collapsed, he was charged with the murder of an African policeman called 'Charlie', whom he had accused of collaborating with the colonial authorities.[3] Kaguvi was found guilty and hanged in 1898. 
Some Ndebele historians say that the form "Kaguvi" is a bastardization of his name by Europeans,[citation needed] and that his real name was "Kakubi Ncube". 
They also claim that together with Nehenda, he ensured that the Shona would rise up at the same time as the Ndebele people in the First Chimurenga. 
The name "Kaguvi" was also given to a man called Gumboreshumba (c1870-1898), who claimed to speak for the original Kaguvi's spirit. Gumboreshumba was one of the many people who claimed to be mediums of famous First Chimurenga personae during the so-called Second Chimurenga. 
Gumboreshumba (meaning: "lion's paw"), lived in Chikwaka's village by Goromonzi Hill, Zimbabwe. 
He had four wives, one of whom was Chief Mashonganyika's daughter. 
The other three wives were received from a headman named Gondo. 
It is alleged that Gumboreshumba Kaguvi was known as a source of good luck in hunting and that he was able to speak to trees and rocks. 
He was believed to be the spirit husband of the other great Shona svikiro, Nehanda. 
Studies of the settlement pattern indicate that the southern regions were the first to be settled, the emet of Aldai on the west and the emet of Soiin on the east, being the first to be established. 
It has been conjectured that the first pororosiek were Kakipoch in Aldai and Tuken in Soiin.[6] 
It is notable that Sirikwa holes (known to the Nandi as mukowanisiek) were almost non-existent in the areas first settled, being only present on the Nandi escarpment itself. 
They were however found in great numbers in the northern regions of Nandi.[1] 
Inward migrants and general population growth are conjectured to have led to a northward expansion of the growing identity during the eighteenth century. 
This period is thought to have seen the occupation and establishment of the emotinwek of Chesume, Emgwen and Masop. 
This period would also have seen the establishment of more pororosiek.[1] 
Sosten Saina, grand-nephew of one of Arap Samoei's bodyguards notes that "There were about 22 of them who went for a meeting with the mzungu that day. 
Koitalel Arap Samoei had been advised not to shake hands because if he did, that would give him away as the leader. 
But he extended his hand and was shot immediately". 
Shortly after this event, the Nandi Resistance ended and Nandi was incorporated into the British East Africa Protectorate.[9] 
Official records of the K.A.R show that a total of 1,197 Nandi were recruited during the war. At the time the Nandi population is estimated to have been about 40-50,000 individuals. Most of those recruited were of the Nyongi age-set which had been initiated during the four year period immediately preceding the war. 
Greenstein (1978) following interviews with veterans of the war found that participation in the war made little impact on the Nyongik, as or as agents-of-change, as regards adapting western methods. Neither did the earned wages seem to engender an affection for the formal economy nor was any effort made towards participation in the political process.[10] 
Socially, the Nyongik had been initiated just prior to the wars, hence they left and returned unmarried. This did not disrupt ordinary patterns since it was more usual than unusual for young men to wait a few years before marriage. 
This time was spent searching for bride wealth, and serving in the war may be said to have served this purpose. 
Later interviews with veterans indicate that they were warmly welcomed back by parents and contemporaries. 
Neither did they bear resentment to their age-mates who had avoided the hardships of military service, some of who had married and acquired cattle in the intervening period. In fact, the veterans note that they expressed gratitude to them for looking after their cattle and other property as they had been slogging around Tanganyika and Mozambique.[1] 
Economically, it is noted that the veterans did not receive pensions as they had expected but that they did return with their back-pay which for some amounted to as much as several hundred shillings, quite a significant sum at the time. It is noted that almost all of the returning veterans used their back pay to purchase cattle, some of which along with cash was used as bride wealth. There were instances of land purchase on the fringes of the reserve but these were minimal. 
Much as the Government had alienated part of the Nandi Reserve the population pressure was not yet great enough to leave most men dissatisfied with the amount of land they would acquire by traditional means. It has been observed that where purchases were made it was done less with entrepreneurial motive than as a desire to increase one's pasture land.[1] 
There were also minimal changes to the employment patterns. 
Few Nandi previously found the prospect of paid employment sufficiently alluring to leave in search of jobs. 
For instance in 1914 only 100 out of a population of about 45,000 was employed outside the District. 
The numbers did rise to 352 for 1915/6 and 612 in 1916/7, largely in response to the wartime needs of the Protectorate but by 1919 they had fallen back to 185. 
While military service continued to appeal to the young men, civilian service did not. The District Commissioner was hard put in 1922 for instance to produce 200 able-bodied young men to work on a local road-building project. He would resort to conscripting them under the 'Native Authority Ordinance', the infamous labor circular written in 1919 by then B.E.A Governor Edward Northey.[1][11] 
Politically, it is observed that the Nyongik assimilated back into the traditional power structure in much the same positions they had left some three or four years earlier. 
Within that structure, age and not stars and stripes counted for seniority. The obligations and ties they resumed were to their families, age-set and korotinwek meaning the common interests of veterans gave way to a man's traditional associations. 
Greenstein notes that the concept of a formal organisation of veterans appears either not to have occurred or perhaps not appealed to them. Even the pension issue did not impel the Nyongik to form any sort of coherent organization.[1] 
Like other Kalenjin, the Nandi have produced a number of notable Kenyan athletes. These include great distance athletes like the legendary Kipchoge Keino (Kip Keino), a gold medalist at Mexico (1968) and Munich (1972) Olympic games and Prof. Mike Boit, a Bronze medalist at Munich 1972 Olympics. 
Others include Peter Koech, Bernard Kipchirchir Lagat who represents the USA and Wilson Kipketer who ran for his adopted home of Denmark. 
Similarly, athletes like Pamela Jelimo, the first Kenyan woman to win an Olympic gold medal, Wilfred Bungei, Richard Mateelong and Super Henry Rono, United Nations Goodwill Ambassador Peter Rono, Tecla Chemabwai, Kenya Paralympian Henry Kirwa among others are Nandi. The father of Kenyan Steeplechasers Amos Kipwambok Biwott comes from the community as does Julius Yego, the first Kenyan to win a World Championships gold medal in a field event. 
The Nandi people have had remarkable political figures like Jean-Marie Seroney, the first MP for Nandi and Tindiret. Seroney was arrested and detained without trial for three and a half years for defending the independence of Parliament at a time when it was becoming an arm of the Executive. 
He worked hard to introduce Bills that would remove or at least check the excessive powers vested in the President as a result of the numerous amendments to the Kenya Constitution. He also brought in the first Private Member's Bill to help ensure that Kenya's elections were free, fair and inclusive. 
As well the Nandi have had leaders such as Henry Kosgey, one of Kenya's longest-serving members of parliament (MP), Kimayo Arap Sego, Joseph Arap Leting who first served as head of Public Service then as an MP. Samwel Ngeny, Kipruto Kirwa, Stanley Metto and Ezekiel Barng'etuny, Dr Joseph Misoy and William Morogo Saina. Gerald Nathaniel Kalya who was the first and long-serving Mosop MP, Tamason Barmalel who was Chepalungu MP and Isaac Ruto who was the MP for Chepalungu and later on, the Governor for Bomet County and Head of the Council of Governors in 2013-2018 . 
William Samoei Ruto who is currently the Deputy President of the Republic of Kenya is of Kipsigis origin from Komosi clan with his genealogy traced to Sigowet-Soin. 
Nandi female politicians include Philomena Chelagat Mutai, a lifelong activist for the inclusion of women in Kenyan politics and society, and Sally Kosgei, a former MP for Aldai.

After Skwatsha won the leadership election, Madikizela and some of Rasool's supporters in Khayelitsha claimed that they were being marginalised, and later excluded as possible ANC candidates for the local government elections in 2006. 
In early 2006, Madikizela along with several other ANC members, including some party councillors, were expelled from the party after it became known of their intention to contest the local government elections as independent candidates.[7][8] 
Although he was not elected as a councillor, Madikizela remained politically active, joining the United Democratic Movement (UDM) in 2007. 
He was appointed the party's Cape Town Metro Regional Secretary until a party investigation found that he had secretly convinced party members to join the Democratic Alliance.[9] 
Born in Port Shepstone, in the province of Natal, Madikizela soon moved to Khayelitsha and became politically active in the area. 
He was a member of the African National Congress (ANC) and United Democratic Movement (UDM), prior to joining the Democratic Alliance (DA) in 2008. 
He was elected as a DA Member of the Western Cape Provincial Parliament in 2009. 
Premier Helen Zille appointed him as the Provincial Minister for Housing.[1][2] 
On 1 April 2021, acting Public Protector Kholeka Gcaleka released a report that found that Madikizela had violated the Executive Ethics Codes by making misleading or false statements to the legislature about Brett Herron, a Good MPP. 
Herron had lodged the complaint. 
Madikizela rejected the legality of the report and said that he would be seeking legal advice.[29] On 6 April 2021, Madikizela announced that he had applied to be the DA's mayoral candidate for the City of Cape Town. 
He is up against incumbent mayor Dan Plato and the DA's finance spokesman, Geordin Hill-Lewis.[30] 
On 13 April 2021, Daily Maverick reported that Madikizela did not have a Bachelor of Commerce degree in Human Resource Management as previously claimed and that he had misled a journalist in this regard.[31] The next day, the DA subsequently announced that its Federal Legal Commission would investigate claims that he lied about having a BCom degree.[32] Premier Winde suspended Madikizela as Provincial Minister for Transport and Public Works for 14 days effective immediately on 15 April and appointed Tertuis Simmers as acting Provincial Minister.[33] Hours later, the DA provincial chairperson, Jaco Londt, sent a letter to party structures informing them that Madikizela had "voluntarily stepped aside" as provincial leader for the next two weeks and that deputy leader Albert Fritz would be acting provincial leader.[34] 
In 2014, he was named Provincial Minister of Human Settlements. A year later, in 2015, Madikizela unseated party stalwart Theuns Botha as deputy provincial leader of the DA. 
DA Provincial leader Patricia de Lille resigned in February 2017 and left Madikizela in charge as acting provincial leader. 
He won a full term in October 2017. 
In 2019, Madikizela became the Provincial Minister of Transport and Public Works. 
After a qualifications scandal, he resigned as Provincial Leader of the DA on 28 April 2021, six months after his re-election in November 2020. 
He also resigned from the provincial cabinet and the provincial parliament, but will remain a DA member. 
He said that he was not pressured to resign as DA provincial leader. 
Madikizela was born in Port Shepstone, Natal on 15 March 1975.[3] His aunt was prominent anti-apartheid activist Winnie Madikizela Mandela.[4] His brother was murdered in 1990 and he then moved to Chatsworth, living in Welbedacht. 
Madikizela and a community leader formed the Welbedacht Development Forum to assist the poor residents of the community.[3] In 1991, he dropped out of Asoka Secondary School and worked at a shoe factory shop in Croftdene. 
In 1998, Madikizela moved to Cape Town to live with his brother. 
His brother helped him enrol at a computer school and Madikizela soon started studying human resource management at the University of South Africa (UNISA). 
Madikizela worked as a car guard at a theme park. 
He soon moved back to Chatsworth and completed a course in computer training.[3] He also became a member of the Chatsworth Child Welfare organisation. 
Madikizela moved back to Cape Town in 2002 and became active in politics.[3] 
Once elected, the politician becomes a Head of Government and has to deal with government officials and government employees. 
Historically, there has been a subtle conflict between the long-term goals of each side.[11] In patronage-based systems, such as the United States in the 19th century, winning politicians replace the government officials and government employees not protected under the civil service ruless with their supporters. It was the "spoils system". 
Public Service reform was initiated to eliminate the corruption of civil services .[12] However, in many less developed countries, the spoils system is in full-scale operation today.[13] 
Many politicians have the knack to remember thousands of names and faces and recall personal anecdotes about their constituents—it is an advantage in the job, rather like being seven-foot tall for a basketball player. 
United States Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton were renowned for their memories.[19][20] 
A politician is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking an elected seat in government. Politicians propose, support, and create laws that govern the land and, by extension, its people. 
Broadly speaking, a "politician" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in the government. 
Politicians are people who are politically active, especially in party politics. 
Positions range from local offices to elective executive and legislative offices of regional and national governments.[1][2] Some elected judges and law enforcement officers, such as sheriffs, are considered politicians.[3][4] 
Politicians are known for their rhetoric, as in speeches or campaign advertisements. 
They are especially known for using common themes that allow them to develop their political positions in terms familiar to the voters.[5] Politicians of necessity become expert users of the media.[6] Politicians in the 19th century made heavy use of newspapers, magazines, and pamphlets, as well as posters.[7] In the 20th century, they branched into radio and television, making television commercials the single most expensive part of an election campaign.[8] In the 21st century, they have become increasingly involved with the social media based on the Internet and smartphones.[9]

Following the arrival of coach Desiree Ellis, it was suggested that Dlamini could have a better chance of becoming the first choice goalkeeper, especially after Barker was released later than expected for friendlies and the 2016 Africa Women Cup of Nations tournament.[3] 
Dlamini is a Christian, and reads the bible to prepare for football matches.[1] 
Andile Dlamini was born on 2 September 1992 in Tembisa, a township of Johannesburg, South Africa.[1] 
Andile Dlamini took up professional football after playing against the South Africa women's national under-20 football team; she was subsequently selected for the team.[2] Nicknamed "Sticks", she previously played for Phomolong Ladies, and currently for Mamelodi Sundowns.[2] 
She made her debut for the South Africa women's national football team against Botswana in 2011.[1] Dlamini has routinely been the reserve goalkeeper for the team, with Thokozile Mndaweni and Roxanne Barker taking the first time spots. 
This has meant that although Dlamini has been named to the squads of both the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, she did not play any time at all during either tournaments.[2] She was disappointed when South Africa were eliminated from the 2015 All Africa Games in the first round through a drawing after each team in the group stage drew all their games.[4] 
Andile Lucky Phehlukwayo (born 3 March 1996) is a South African professional cricketer.[1] He is a left handed lower order batsman who bowls right-arm fast-medium. 
He made his international debut for South Africa in September 2016.[2] 
Early life 
Phehlukwayo won a bursary to Glenwood High School in Durban for field hockey. 
He was introduced to cricket by his guardian Rosemary Dismore, who employed his mother as a domestic worker.[3] 
In January 2014, Phehlukwayo was named in South Africa’s 15 man squad for the 2014 Under-19 Cricket World Cup.[4] 
Phehlukwayo was included in the KwaZulu-Natal cricket team squad for the 2015 Africa T20 Cup.[5]

Andile Khumalo (born 12 May 1978) is a South African composer and a music lecturer at the University of Witwatersrand. 
In 2013, he completed his Doctor of Musical Arts at Columbia University under the supervision of George Lewis. There he also studied with Fabien Levy and Tristan Murail. 
Prior to his DMA, Khumalo studied under Marco Stroppa at the Staatliche Hochschule für Musik und Darstellende Kunst Stuttgart (HMDKS) and with Jürgen Bräuninger at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. 
Khumalo's compositions are predominantly in a spectral style. 
This extraordinarily compact composition performs with aplomb the bridging of the temporal gulf between words, which can generate an entire network of associations in an instant, and music, which despite its reputation for immediacy, takes its time to construct its environment. 
While many composers routinely report their interest in "time"–a seeming truism–the implication of Khumalo's composition goes beyond now-conventional disruptions and transgressions of disciplinary boundaries. Shades of Words transposes disciplinary contentions and struggles for meaning to a higher and more resonant register that asks us how to reconcile two experiences of time: one in remembrance, recollection, and fantasy, where indeterminacy and agency meet, and the other on a (now often virtual) page, operating in the interstices between immediacy and permanence.[17] 
Andile Khumalo's Shades of Words, a setting of poetry by Alexandra Zelman-Doring, was written in the style of European post-second-Viennese- school/Darmstadt modernism. The relevance of this Eurocentric music to the cultural situation in South Africa is debatable, and newly-created music in this idiom is almost inevitably derivative. Perhaps Khumalo, now back in South Africa after many years of studies in Germany and the United States, will yet develop a South African slant to this style of music, leading to a more individual voice.[18] 
perhaps in the case of [Khumalo], it served a young black South African composer well to not reproduce [the shift an accessible aesthetic], so as to challenge persisting notions of the African as primitive (natural, tonal) compared to the west as modern (universal, abstract). 
When looking at the other works by Khumalo in my possession (ISO(R) for flute, cello and piano (2004), Ossia for clarinet and cello (2010) and Schaufe(r)nster for piano (2011)), it is clear that Khumalo does not aim to always denote 'Africa' in his works.[1] 
Khumalo was born in and grew up in Umlazi, a township located south-west of Durban in the coastal province of KwaZulu-Natal. 
Khumalo's early music education included training at the Siyakhula community music centre.[1] In 1998 he enrolled for a music degree at the University of KwaZulu-Natal where he studied composition with Jürgen Bräuninger, which he completed in 2001.[2] From 2002 till 2007, Khumalo studied composition with Marco Stroppa and music theory with Matthias Herman at HMDKS.[3] He then took up a position as a Faculty Fellow at Columbia University,[4] completing his PhD with a dissertation on Beat Furrer's FAMA.[5] 
Khumalo was employed as a lecturer in music theory, composition and orchestration at the University of Witwatersrand in 2013.[6] He has also been active in the Sterkfontein Composers Meeting[7] and a tutor for the South African Society for Research in Music's new music meeting.[8] 
Two of Khumalo's works, Shades of Words and Cry Out, have particularly gained significant critical reception. Reviewing the Festival d'Automne performance of Shades of Words, Martin Kaltenecker writes, 
In January 2014, Jali signed for Belgian Pro League team K.V. Oostende.

The party did contest the May 2019 general election and won no representation in parliament or in the nine provincial legislatures.[6] In July, the IEC announced the annulment of the party's registration, following an appeal by the Freedom Front Plus.[7] The party appealed the judgement but it was upheld in November.[8]

INduna (plural: iziNduna) is a Zulu/Xhosa title meaning advisor, great leader, ambassador, headman or commander of a group of warriors. 
It can also mean spokesperson or mediator, as the iziNduna often acted as a bridge between the people and the king.[1] The title was reserved for senior officials appointed by the king or chief and was awarded to individuals held in high esteem for their qualities of leadership, bravery or service to the community.[2][3] The iziNduna would regularly gather for an indaba to discuss important issues. 
Amongst the Ndebele the term was also used to collectively refer to a group of elite soldiers operating under a specific induna.[4]

The term has found widespread use in South African English and Afrikaans, and it is a common reference to boss or lead person.[5] In modern times the terms Chairperson and induna are sometimes used interchangeably.[6] 
Ntabazinduna (Mountain of the Chiefs) is the name of a hill north of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.[7] The name stems from the practice of throwing izinDuna who ran afoul of the king down it.[8] Induna was the name of a racehorse that won the 1930 South Australian Derby. 
Canada's largest crocodile (14 feet long, weighing more than 1000 pounds) is called Induna. It resides at the Reptilia (zoo) in Vaughan, Ontario.

Makgoba is open to discussions on the orthodox Anglican stance on homosexuality. 
The Anglican Diocese of Cape Town, after a Synod held in Cape Town, on 20–22 August 2009, passed a resolution calling the Anglican Church in Southern Africa bishops to give pastoral guidelines for homosexual couples living in "covenanted partnerships". 
At the same time, it was approved an amendment for the resolution which provided that the guidelines "due regard of the mind of the Anglican Communion." 
Makgoba stated that the resolution was "an important first step to saying: 'Lord, how do we do ministry in this context?' 
I'm a developmental person. 
I don't believe in big bangs. 
If you throw a little pebble into water, it sends out concentric circles and hopefully that way change comes from that." 
He also said that "South Africa has laws that approve a civil union in this context, but not in the other countries within our province. 
In central Africa and north Africa, both the Anglican Church and the state say 'no'" and "The reason for this resolution was because we have these parishioners, and the law provides for them to be in that state, so how do we pastorally respond to that?"[6] 
In 2016 Makgoba stated he was "pained" after a church synod rejected a proposal to allow bishops to license gay and lesbian clergy who are in same sex civil marriages to minister in parishes and rejected a motion to provide for prayers of blessing to be offered for those in same sex civil marriages. 
After the synod, which covered churches from Angola, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, St Helena, and Swaziland, Makgoba advised "our lesbian and gay sisters and brothers: I was deeply pained by the outcome of the debate".[7]

Between the extremes of optimal health and death from starvation or malnutrition, there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet. Deficiencies, excesses, and imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health, which may lead to various health problems such as scurvy, obesity, or osteoporosis, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases as well as psychological and behavioral problems. The science of nutrition attempts to understand how and why specific dietary aspects influence health. 
Nutrients in food are grouped into several categories. Macronutrients are fat, protein, and carbohydrates. 
Micronutrients are the minerals and vitamins. 
Additionally, food contains water and dietary fiber. 
Food is usually of plant, animal or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts. 
Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the world is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food with intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems. 
This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural system is one of the major contributors to climate change, accountable for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions.[2] Addressing the carbon intensity of the food system and food waste are important mitigation measures in the global response to climate change. 
Most food has its origin in plants. 
Some food is obtained directly from plants; but even animals that are used as food sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants. 
Cereal grain is a staple food that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop.[3] Corn (maize), wheat, and rice – in all of their varieties – account for 87% of all grain production worldwide.[4][5][6] Most of the grain that is produced worldwide is fed to livestock. 
To interpret these passages of Leviticus, it's important to know that this book of the Bible focuses on ritual purity for the Israelites, and setting guidelines for the Israelites to distinguish themselves from their pagan neighbors, the Egyptians and Canaanites, who lived in the lands before they were settled by the Jews. 
This is shown in Leviticus Chapters 18 and 20 by three specific scripture passages (Leviticus 18:2–3, 18:24 and 20:23) that state that the Israelites should never do what the Egyptians and Canaanites did.[4] 
While the Jewish prophets spoke only of lack of charity as the sin of Sodom,[8] the exclusively sexual interpretation became so prevalent among Christian communities that the name "Sodom" became the basis of the word "sodomy", still a legal synonym for homosexual and non-procreative sexual acts, particularly anal or oral sex.[9] 
There are a number of passages in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament that have been interpreted as involving same-sex sexual acts and desires. 
The passages about homosexuality in the Hebrew Bible start as early as the Torah (the first five books of the Bible). Several scriptures in the New Testament also reference homosexuality, including the Gospel in the books of Matthew, Luke, and various letters from Saint Paul to the early churches in Asia Minor. 
While the Jewish prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos and Zephaniah refer vaguely to the sin of Sodom,[1] Ezekiel specifies that the city was destroyed because of its commission of social injustice as well as its commission of "abomination:"[2] 
Later traditions on Sodom's sin, such as Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, considered it to be an illicit form of heterosexual intercourse.[1] In Jude 1:7–8 the Bible says of Sodom and Gomorrha: 
Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. 
Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh..."[13] 
This has been interpreted as a reference to homosexuality by some and to the sexual lust of mortals after angels by others.[1] Jewish writers Philo (d. 
A.D. 50) and Josephus (37 – c. 
100) were the first reported individuals to assert unambiguously that homosexuality was among the sins of Sodom.[12] By the end of the 1st century A.D., Jews commonly identified the sin of Sodom with homosexual practices.[14] 
Chapters 18 and 20 of Leviticus form part of the Holiness code and list prohibited forms of intercourse, including the following verses: 
"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination." 
Chapter 18 verse 22[1] "If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them." 
Chapter 20 verse 13[2] 
These two verses have historically been interpreted by Jews and Christians as clear overall prohibitions against homosexual acts in general.[citation needed] More recent interpretations focus on the passage's context as part of the Holiness Code, a code of purity meant to distinguish the behavior of the Israelites from the polytheistic Canaanites.[3] One of those interpretations is from Janet Edmonds, which says: 
Abomination (from Latin abominare, "to deprecate as an ill omen") is an English term used to translate the Biblical Hebrew terms shiqquts שיקוץ‎ and sheqets שקץ‎,[1] which are derived from shâqats, or the terms תֹּועֵבָה‎, tōʻēḇā or to'e'va (noun) or 'ta'ev (verb). 
An abomination in English is that which is exceptionally loathsome, hateful, sinful, wicked, or vile. 
In 2014 the newly built Natalspruit Hospital was officially opened and was christened as the "future of Gauteng Health" by Makhura. The Minister of Health Aaron Motsoaledi, who also attended the opening with Makhura, said that the equipment found inside the hospital was previously only found in private hospitals. The Natalspruit Hospital had cost R 1.7 billion to construct in a period of 8 years and was furnished with 821 beds.[11] 
A survey suggested that 69% of people in Gauteng were satisfied with the provincial healthcare services. 
Makhura said that it was not good enough and was aiming for 80% satisfactory level by 2019. Makhura said that the Department of Health in Gauteng would spend more than R1.2 billion over three years on the modernisation of public health and R3 billion on equipment. 
Following the May 2019 elections, the ANC announced that it had retained Makhura in his position of Premier of Gauteng. His second term as premier commenced on 22 May 2019, after he defeated the Democratic Alliance's Solly Msimanga for the post.[16][17][18] 
On 10 July 2020, Makhura announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19, becoming the third premier in one week to test positive for the virus.[19] 
Thandi Modise (born 25 December 1959, Vryburg)[1] is a South African politician, and former Anti-Apartheid guerilla. 
She is currently serving as Speaker of the National Assembly of South Africa. She served as Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces[2] from 2014 to 2019. 
She left South Africa in 1976 to join the African National Congress and received training in Angola. 
She returned to South Africa in 1978 as an Umkhonto weSizwe operative.[1] She was arrested and imprisoned in 1979, becoming the first woman in South Africa to be jailed for MK activities.[1] 
In 2017, she was caught taking a travel allowance of more than R125 000, which she was not entitled to as the chairwoman of the National Council of Provinces. 
She was requested to repay this allowance over a period of three years, but she resisted this instruction and it has not been established whether she did eventually repay the sum.[3] 
In July 2014, the NSPCA discovered a number of dead animals, including chickens, pigs, goats and geese, on a farm owned by Modise in Modderfontein, outside Potchefstroom in the North West Province. 
It was apparent that the animals had gone without food and water for more than a week, and 85 remaining pigs on the farm had resorted to cannibalising 58 dead pigs.[4] No workers were present on the property. 
North West Police confirmed on 7 July that she will face charges of animal cruelty in violation of the Animal Protection Act. 
She responded to the claims by stating that she was "learning"[5] how to farm, and that she had appointed a farm manager, but he had abandoned his duties to attend to a family matter.[6] Approximately four months later, it was reported that conditions on the farm had improved, that Modise's cattle had been receiving sufficient food and were in an "acceptable condition".[7] 
The NSPCA and AfriForum opened a case of animal cruelty against Modise, which is yet to be heard.[8] 
Dlamini is a surname, common in Eswatini and neighbouring parts of South Africa. 
People with the surname Dlamini include: 
Bheki Dlamini served as acting Prime Minister of Swaziland from 18 September 2008 to 23 October 2008.[1] 
Dlamini was 2006-2013 head of the royal office of King Mswati III. 
After the dismissal of the previous government of Prime Minister Absalom Themba Dlamini, he was on 18 September 2008 acting Prime Minister of Swaziland. He held this office until October 23, 2008 and was then replaced by Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini. 
In 2006, the Directorate of Special Operations implicated Dlamini and thirteen other ANC MPs in what South African media called the "Travelgate" scandal, a scandal involving abuse of Parliamentary travel vouchers. 
Her charge sheet stated that she knew the travel vouchers could be used only for air travel but nevertheless used them to cover the costs of hotel accommodation, car rentals, and other benefits. 
She was convicted of fraud after pleading guilty to a total of R245,000 in fraudulent travel claims.[1][5] 
Dlamini subsequently lost her position as a member of Parliament. 
However, at the 52nd National Conference of the ANC in December 2007, Dlamini was elected to the ANC's National Executive and National Working Committees.[1] 
Dlamini was appointed as Deputy Minister of Social Development on 11 May 2009, and became Minister of Social Development on 1 November 2010.[1] 
As Chairperson of the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on Gender Based Violence, she led the roll out of the Gender-Based Violence Command Centre, a 24-hour call centre which supported and counselled victims of gender-based violence. 
Dlamini also chaired the IMC on Combating Substance Abuse and the IMC for Early Childhood Development.[1] 
In 2016, Dlamini was challenged by the opposition Democratic Alliance after she defended the amount of R753 per month that a social grant beneficiary receives as "enough to buy adequate food as well as additional non-food items", while she herself stayed at hotels costing R11,000 a night.[6] In late 2016 she also accepted at luxury car valued at R1.3 million, and her deputy, Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu, a R1.1 million car.[7] 
As Minister of Social Development, Dlamini failed to realise the government's plan to take over payment of South Africa's social grants by 31 March 2017, when the existing arrangement with Cash Paymaster Services to distribute payments had been due to expire. 
This created a concern that welfare recipients would not receive grant payments from 1 April 2017. 
Dlamini was criticised for her lack of action and her inability to ensure either a new service contract or the insourcing of the service. 
She was also criticised for her handling of the media during the controversy.[1] On 6 March 2017, the contract with Cash Paymaster Services was renewed for another 2 years.[8] 
The Constitutional Court held Dlamini primarily responsible for the crisis,[9] with Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng saying there was no explanation for the incompetence displayed by her and SASSA.[10] According to constitutional scholar Pierre de Vos, the Constitutional Court had concluded that SASSA and Dlamini could not be trusted to do their constitutionally mandated job to ensure delivery of social grants, and could not be trusted not to lie to the courts in the future.[11] 
In September of 2018 the Constitutional Court found, unanimously, that Dlamini ought to be held accountable in her personal capacity for 20% of the costs of the case brought against her by Black Sash Trust and Freedom Under Law. 
Further, she was found to have misled the court – that is, she lied under oath – in order to protect herself. 
The National Prosecuting Authority will decide whether or not to charge her with perjury.[12] 
Despite her failures, President Jacob Zuma continued to support Dlamini.[13] She in turn supported Zuma's preferred candidate, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, in her campaign to succeed him as ANC leader and South Africa's president.[14] 
Dlamini was born in Nquthu on 10 September 1962 and grew up in Nkandla, Matshensikazi[1] and Imbali, Pietermaritzburg.[2] She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Social Studies from the University of Zululand.[3] 
Dlamini was politically active from an early age. In 1983 she became one of the founding members of Imbali Youth Organisation, an affiliate of the United Democratic Front, which worked closely with the South African Students Congress and Imbali Civic Organisation. In 1985, she joined the South African National Students Congress as one of only a few women who participated in its politics. 
In 1989, Dlamini graduated from the University of Zululand with a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Social Work which she passed with distinction.[1] 
In 1991 she became part of interim leadership that built the African National Congress (ANC) Women's League structures in KwaZulu-Natal. 
She was then elected to the first Regional Executive Committee of the ANCWL. 
In 1992 and 1993, she served as Regional Secretary, and was elected as Deputy Secretary General of the ANCWL in 1993.[1] In 1998 she was elected Secretary General of the ANCWL, and served for two terms until 2008.[2] 
On 7 August 2015, Dlamini was elected as the ANCWL's new leader, replacing then-Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga.[1] 
In 2017 Dlamini campaigned for former African Union chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to be elected as president of the ANC.[4]

Absalom Dlamini (born 5 August 1984) is a Swazi footballer with the Royal Leopards and the Swaziland national football team.[1] He plays on position of defensive midfielder. 
Dlamini was a Swazi politician known to be pro-South African and traditionalist. 
He was elected as Prime Minister in place of Prince Mabandla Dlamini after there were conflicts between Mabandla and other members of congress led by Mfanasibili Dlamini during the regency of Queen Dzeliwe. Dzeliwe was against this change and this led to her dismissal from the post of regent by Queen Ntombi. 
Bhekimpi started persecution of those who had fled the South African apartheid regime.

"Seeing that Tapuwa Kapini has another three years with us, it was agreed that we would release 'Casillas' [Khuzwayo] because he wouldn't be playing as the first-choice goalkeeper. 
So to enable him to get more game-time we have decided to allow him to join Chiefs after they had approached us for his services,"[7] He made his debut on 28 April 2013 against Platinum Stars at the Peter Mokaba Stadium. 
The match was billed as the title decider but ended 0–0.[8] He won the league and cup double with Chiefs.

In the 2014–15 season he played his first league match in a 2–1 win over University of Pretoria conceding his first league goal since joining Chiefs.[5] Ahead of the eagerly anticipated MTN 8 final, Khuzwayo was the favourite to be the goalkeeper in the absence of Itumeleng Khune. 
Coach Stuart Baxter said "Itu is one of our top players, and of course we'll miss him. 
If my Lamborghini isn't working today then maybe I have to take the old Porsche. 
One of our 'keepers has now got to be a Porsche, maybe he's not a Lamborghini just yet, but he can be that Porsche. 
Lets see if they step up."[12] In his Soweto derby debut on 20 September 2014, despite being written off as the "weakest link", Khuzwayo made numerous saves in Chiefs' 1–0 win over Orlando Pirates in the MTN 8 Final at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durbanhis hometown, and he thanked everyone at the club, most notably Khune, after he received the Man of the Match award. 
"First and foremost I'd like to thank my family, my brothers, my friends, everyone who believed in me, Itumeleng Khune, he was motivating me all the time since I came to Kaizer Chiefs, he's just an inspiration to me,"[13]

Sizwe Lawrence Ndlovu (born 24 September 1980) is a South African rower. 
He won a gold medal in the Men's lightweight coxless four event at the 2012 Summer Olympics.[1][2] It was South Africa's first ever Olympic gold medal for rowing.[3] The rest of the team were James Thompson, John Smith and Matthew Brittain. 
Ndlovu gradually suffered due to inconsistency. 
The large and expansive side Gordon Strachan inherited, well equipped with attacking options, saw fierce competition for places from Whelan, Huckerby, Salako and Telfer. 
An increasingly cosmopolitan Premier league too would eventually see Coventry turn to Steve Froggatt and Moroccan internationals Mustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo in the years following Ndlovu's departure. 
He was known as 'Nuddy' by Coventry City fans[6] and his other nicknames being 'The Bulawayo Bullet'[7] and 'Nsukuzonke'[8] an isiNdebele word referring to his ability to turn on the style everytime/day he played. 
Peter Ndlovu (born 25 February 1973) is a Zimbabwean former professional footballer and is currently the Team Manager at Mamelodi Sundowns F.C. a Premier Soccer League club in South Africa.[3] 
Peter Ndlovu originally comes from Binga district in North Western, Siabuwa Zimbabwe. He was however born in Bulawayo, and played professionally as a striker from 1988 until 2011. 
He played for Highlanders in Zimbabwe, for Coventry City in the Premier League and in the Football League for Birmingham City, Huddersfield Town and Sheffield United. 
In South Africa he played for Mamelodi Sundowns, Thanda Royal Zulu, Highfield United and Black Mambas. He was capped 81 times for his country, scoring 37 goals.[4] 
Ndlovu was originally spotted by John Sillett, prior to his official signing from Highlanders by Terry Butcher in July 1991. He made an immediate impact by scoring away at Arsenal and then became the toast of Highfield Road with a thunderbolt winner against Aston Villa in November 1991, endearing him to the Sky Blues fans.[5] 
Although he would go on to play a major role at several clubs in the Championship, it is his time at Coventry he is particularly known for given the club's top flight status at that time. He would play a significant role in two major teams, Bobby Gould's attacking team of 1992/93 and the expansive squad of the mid and late 1990s, during which time Ron Atkinson and then Gordon Strachan managed the club. 
Bobby Gould's team in 1992–93 are widely regarded as under-achievers, finishing 15th in the first Premier League season, having spent much of the season in considerably higher positions. 
On 19 August 1992, Ndlovu made history by being the first African footballer to play in the new English Premier League. 
Having acquired striker Micky Quinn in November 1992 they continued what had already been a blistering start, with away wins at Tottenham Hotspur (2–0) Sheffield Wednesday (2–1) and Wimbledon (2–1) to add to already impressive home wins against Middlesbrough (2–1). By the early autumn the Sky Blues briefly topped the inaugural Premier League and would only lose five league games prior to Christmas. 
The addition of Micky Quinn to the squad led to further outstanding home wins against Aston Villa (3–0) and Liverpool (5–1). In February 1993, they won 4-2 against title chasing, big spending Blackburn Rovers. 
However, a barren final few weeks of the season and a run in that would see back to back games against Man United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Leeds United saw them slip from fifth in the league in February to 15th in the final table. 
The season finished with a thrilling performance from Ndlovu in a 3–3 draw against Leeds United. Ndlovu was a key component throughout the season in Gould's fast pacey front line which included John Williams, Kevin Gallacher (until his departure to Blackburn) and Robert Rosario, who formed a worthy partnership with Micky Quinn. Ndlovu's goal against Norwich City, in a 1–1 draw in late September, was a signature piece of Ndlovu flair which earned him the Match of Day 'Goal of the month' competition.[1] 
Ndlovu serves as Chancellor of the Zimbabwe Catholic University.[7] He also founded the Mother Patrick Primary School at Waterfalls. 
As Archbishop of Harare, Ndlovu is President of the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops' Conference (ZCBC).[8] 
In May 2011, Ndlovu consecrated the St Bakhita Catholic centre for the disabled at Makumbi.[9] 
Ndlovu was born on 25 December 1955 at Tshongokwe, Matabeleland, Rhodesia. 
He was educated at the Marist Brothers Dete in the Hwange diocese before entering the Major Seminary at Chishawasha. He was ordained a priest on 28 August 1983 at the age of twenty-seven in Hwange, Zimbabwe.[1] 
Ndlovu has openly criticised the regime in Zimbabwe for forced evictions[2] and other human rights abuses.[3] He has stated that the "role of a bishop and of the church in general is to stand up for human dignity, and from human dignity flow human rights".[4] This has angered some in the government who respond that the Archbishop is sowing seeds of tribal discord.[5] In August 2020 the Papal Nuncio for Zimbabwe visited the archbisop, and expressed solidarity for his positions on the treatment of Zimbabwean citizens.[6]

Adam and Eve are the Bible's first man and first woman.[9][10] Adam's name appears first in Genesis 1 with a collective sense, as "mankind"; subsequently in Genesis 2–3 it carries the definite article ha, equivalent to English "the", indicating that this is "the man".[9] In these chapters God fashions "the man" (ha adam) from earth (adamah), breathes life into his nostrils, and makes him a caretaker over creation.[9] God next creates for the man an ezer kenegdo, a "helper corresponding to him", from his side or rib.[10] The word "rib" is a pun in Sumerian, as the word ti means both "rib" and "life".[11][12] She is called ishsha, "woman", because, the text says, she is formed from ish, "man".[10] The man receives her with joy, and the reader is told that from this moment a man will leave his parents to "cling" to a woman, the two becoming one flesh.[10] 
The first man and woman are in God's Garden of Eden, where all creation is vegetarian and there is no violence. They are permitted to eat the fruits of all the trees except one, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The woman is tempted by a talking serpent to eat the forbidden fruit, and gives some to the man, who eats also.[10] (Contrary to popular myth she does not beguile the man, who appears to have been present at the encounter with the serpent).[10] God curses all three, the man to a lifetime of hard labour followed by death, the woman to the pain of childbirth and to subordination to her husband, and the serpent to go on his belly and suffer the enmity of both man and woman.[10] God then clothes the nakedness of the man and woman, who have become god-like in knowing good and evil, then banishes them from the garden lest they eat the fruit of a second tree, the tree of life, and live forever.[13] 
The story continues in Genesis 3 with the "expulsion from Eden" narrative. 
A form analysis of Genesis 3 reveals that this portion of the story can be characterized as a parable or "wisdom tale" in the wisdom tradition. 
The poetic addresses of the chapter belong to a speculative type of wisdom that questions the paradoxes and harsh realities of life. 
This characterization is determined by the narrative's format, settings, and the plot. 
The form of Genesis 3 is also shaped by its vocabulary, making use of various puns and double entendres.[14] 
The Fall of Man by Peter Paul Rubens, 1628–29 
Genesis 4 narrates life outside the garden, including the birth of Adam and Eve's first children Cain and Abel and the story of the first murder. 
A third son, Seth, is born to Adam and Eve, and Adam had "other sons and daughters" (Genesis 5:4). Genesis 5 lists Adam's descendants from Seth to Noah with their ages at the birth of their first sons and their ages at death. 
Adam's age at death is given as 930 years. 
According to the Book of Jubilees, Cain married his sister Awan, a daughter of Adam and Eve.[29] 
The Primeval History forms the opening chapters of the Torah, the five books making up the history of the origins of Israel. 
This achieved something like its current form in the 5th century BCE,[30] but Genesis 1–11 shows little relationship to the rest of the Bible:[31] for example, the names of its characters and its geography – Adam (man) and Eve (life), the Land of Nod ("Wandering"), and so on – are symbolic rather than real,[32] and almost none of the persons, places and stories mentioned in it are ever met anywhere else.[32] This has led scholars to suppose that the History forms a late composition attached to Genesis and the Pentateuch to serve as an introduction.[33] Just how late is a subject for debate: at one extreme are those who see it as a product of the Hellenistic period, in which case it cannot be earlier than the first decades of the 4th century BCE;[34] on the other hand the Yahwist source has been dated by some scholars, notably John Van Seters, to the exilic pre-Persian period (the 6th century BCE) precisely because the Primeval History contains so much Babylonian influence in the form of myth.[35][Note 1] The Primeval History draws on two distinct "sources", the Priestly source and what is sometimes called the Yahwist source and sometimes simply the "non-Priestly"; for the purpose of discussing Adam and Eve in the Book of Genesis the terms "non-Priestly" and "Yahwist" can be regarded as interchangeable.[36] 
Adam (Hebrew: אָדָם‎‎‎ ʾĀḏām; Aramaic: ܐܕܡ; Arabic: آدَم‎, romanized: ʾĀdam; Greek: Ἀδάμ, romanized: Adám; Latin: Adam) and Eve (חַוָּה‎ ‎‎Ḥavvā; Arabic: حَوَّاء‎, romanized: Ḥawwāʾ; Greek: Εὕα, romanized: Heúa; Latin: Eva, Heva; Syriac: ܚܰܘܳܐ romanized: ḥawâ) according to the creation myth of the Abrahamic religions,[1][2] were the first man and woman. 
They are central to the belief that humanity is in essence a single family, with everyone descended from a single pair of original ancestors.[3] They also provide the basis for the doctrines of the fall of man and original sin that are important beliefs in Christianity, although not held in Judaism or Islam.[4] 
Some early fathers of the Christian church held Eve responsible for the Fall of man and all subsequent women to be the first sinners because Eve tempted Adam to commit the taboo. 
"You are the devil's gateway" Tertullian told his female readers, and went on to explain that they were responsible for the death of Christ: "On account of your desert [i.e., punishment for sin, that is, death], even the Son of God had to die."[39] In 1486, the Dominicans Kramer and Sprengler used similar tracts in Malleus Maleficarum ("Hammer of Witches") to justify the persecution of "witches". 
In the Book of Genesis of the Hebrew Bible, chapters one through five, there are two creation narratives with two distinct perspectives. In the first, Adam and Eve are not named. 
Instead, God created humankind in God's image and instructed them to multiply and to be stewards over everything else that God had made. In the second narrative, God fashions Adam from dust and places him in the Garden of Eden. Adam is told that he can eat freely of all the trees in the garden, except for a tree of the knowledge of good and evil. 
Subsequently, Eve is created from one of Adam's ribs to be his companion. They are innocent and unembarrassed about their nakedness. However, a serpent convinces Eve to eat fruit from the forbidden tree, and she gives some of the fruit to Adam. 
These acts give them additional knowledge, but it gives them the ability to conjure negative and destructive concepts such as shame and evil. God later curses the serpent and the ground. God prophetically tells the woman and the man what will be the consequences of their sin of disobeying God. 
Then he banishes them from the Garden of Eden. 
Another Gnostic tradition held that Adam and Eve were created to help defeat Satan. 
The serpent, instead of being identified with Satan, is seen as a hero by the Ophites. Still other Gnostics believed that Satan's fall, however, came after the creation of humanity. 
As in Islamic tradition, this story says that Satan refused to bow to Adam due to pride. 
Satan said that Adam was inferior to him as he was made of fire, whereas Adam was made of clay. 
This refusal led to the fall of Satan recorded in works such as the Book of Enoch. 
The myth underwent extensive elaboration in later Abrahamic traditions, and it has been extensively analyzed by modern biblical scholars. Interpretations and beliefs regarding Adam and Eve and the story revolving around them vary across religions and sects; for example, the Islamic version of the story holds that Adam and Eve were equally responsible for their sins of hubris, instead of Eve being the first one to be unfaithful. The story of Adam and Eve is often depicted in art, and it has had an important influence in literature and poetry. 
In Islam, Adam (Ādam; Arabic: آدم‎), whose role is being the father of humanity, is looked upon by Muslims with reverence. 
Eve (Ḥawwāʼ; Arabic: حواء ) is the "mother of humanity".[42] The creation of Adam and Eve is referred to in the Qurʼān, although different Qurʼanic interpreters give different views on the actual creation story (Qurʼan, Surat al-Nisaʼ, verse 1).[43] 
In al-Qummi's tafsir on the Garden of Eden, such place was not entirely earthly. 
According to the Qurʼān, both Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit in a Heavenly Eden. 
As a result, they were both sent down to Earth as God's representatives. 
Each person was sent to a mountain peak: Adam on al-Safa, and Eve on al-Marwah. 
In this Islamic tradition, Adam wept 40 days until he repented, after which God sent down the Black Stone, teaching him the Hajj. According to a prophetic hadith, Adam and Eve reunited in the plain of ʻArafat, near Mecca.[44] They had two sons together, Qabil and Habil. 
There is also a legend of a younger son, named Rocail, who created a palace and sepulcher containing autonomous statues that lived out the lives of men so realistically they were mistaken for having souls.[45] 
The concept of "original sin" does not exist in Islam because, according to Islam, Adam and Eve were forgiven by God. 
When God orders the angels to bow to Adam, Iblīs questioned, "Why should I bow to man? 
I am made of pure fire and he is made of soil."[46] The liberal movements within Islam have viewed God's commanding the angels to bow before Adam as an exaltation of humanity, and as a means of supporting human rights; others view it as an act of showing Adam that the biggest enemy of humans on earth will be their ego.[47] 
In Swahili literature, Eve ate from the forbidden tree, thus causing her expulsion, after being tempted by Iblis. Thereupon, Adam heroically eats from the forbidden fruit in order to follow Eve and protect her on earth.[48] 
In the Baháʼí Faith, Adam is regarded as the first Manifestation of God.[49] The Adam and Eve narrative is seen as symbolic. 
In Some Answered Questions, 'Abdu'l-Bahá rejects a literal reading and states that the story contains "divine mysteries and universal meanings".[50] Adam symbolizes the "spirit of Adam", Eve symbolizes "His self", the Tree of Knowledge symbolizes "the material world", and the serpent symbolizes "attachment to the material world".[51][52][53] The fall of Adam thus represents the way humanity became conscious of good and evil.[49] In another sense, Adam and Eve represent God's Will and Determination, the first two of the seven stages of Divine Creative Action.[54] 
While a traditional view was that the Book of Genesis was authored by Moses and has been considered historical and metaphorical, modern scholars consider the Genesis creation narrative as one of various ancient origin myths.[55][56] 
The opening chapters of the Book of Genesis provide a mythic history of the infiltration of evil into the world.[5] God places the first man and woman (Adam and Eve) in his Garden of Eden, from whence they are expelled; the first murder follows, and God's decision to destroy the world and save only the righteous Noah and his sons; a new humanity then descends from these and spreads throughout the world, but although the new world is as sinful as the old, God has resolved never again to destroy the world by flood, and the History ends with Terah, the father of Abraham, from whom will descend God's chosen people, the Israelites.[6] Neither Adam nor Eve is mentioned elsewhere in the Hebrew scriptures apart from a single listing of Adam in a genealogy in 1 Chronicles 1:1,[7] suggesting that although their story came to be prefixed to the Jewish story, it has little in common with it.[8]

Sexual arousal (also sexual excitement) describes the physiological and psychological responses in preparation for sexual intercourse or when exposed to sexual stimuli. 
A number of physiological responses occur in the body and mind as preparation for sexual intercourse and continue during it. 
Male arousal will lead to an erection, and in female arousal the body's response is engorged sexual tissues such as nipples, vulva, clitoris, vaginal walls, and vaginal lubrication. Mental stimuli and physical stimuli such as touch, and the internal fluctuation of hormones, can influence sexual arousal. 
The beginnings of sexual arousal in a woman's body is usually marked by vaginal lubrication (wetness; though this can occur without arousal due to infection or cervical mucus production around ovulation), swelling and engorgement of the external genitals, and internal lengthening and enlargement of the vagina.[5] There have been studies to find the degree of correlation between these physiological responses and the woman's subjective sensation of being sexually aroused: the findings usually are that in some cases there is a high correlation, while in others, it is surprisingly low.[6] 
Sexual arousal has several stages and may not lead to any actual sexual activity, beyond a mental arousal and the physiological changes that accompany it. Given sufficient sexual stimulation, sexual arousal in humans reaches its climax during an orgasm. 
It may also be pursued for its own sake, even in the absence of an orgasm. 
As sexual arousal and stimulation continues, it is likely that the glans or head of the erect penis will swell wider and, as the genitals become further engorged with blood, their color deepens and the testicles can grow up to 50% larger. 
As the testicles continue to rise, a feeling of warmth may develop around them and the perineum. 
With further sexual stimulation, their heart rate increases, blood pressure rises and breathing becomes quicker.[1] The increase in blood flow in the genital and other regions may lead to a sex flush in some men.[13] 
After orgasm and ejaculation, men usually experience a refractory period characterized by loss of their erection, a subsidence in any sex flush, less interest in sexual activity, and a feeling of relaxation that can be attributed to the neurohormones oxytocin and prolactin.[15] The intensity and duration of the refractory period can be very short in a highly aroused young man in a highly arousing situation, perhaps without even a noticeable loss of erection. It can be as long as a few hours or days in middle-aged and older men.[2] 
While human sexuality is well understood, scientists do not completely grasp how other animals relate sexually. However, current research studies suggest that many animals, like humans, enjoy sexual relations that are not limited to reproduction. Dolphins and bonobos, for example, are both well known to use sex as a "social tool to strengthen and maintain bonds."[65] Ethologists have long documented the exchanges of sex to promote group cohesion in social animals. 
Cementing social bondage is one of the most prominent theorized selective advantages of group selection theory. 
Experts in the evolution of sex such as John Maynard Smith advocate for the idea that the exchange of sexual favors helps congeal and localize the assortment of alleles in isolated population and therefore is potentially a very strong force in evolution. 
Maynard Smith has also written extensively on the "seminal fluid swapping theory" logistic application of the assortment of alleles as a more accurate synthetic depiction of the Hardy–Weinberg principle in cases of severely interbreeding populations.

Wasil Ahmad was born in Uruzgan province. 
The region has been described as "long... a centre of conflict;" Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar was born there, and the later president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, led the first Pashtun revolt against the Taliban there in 2001.[2] Ahmad's father had previously been killed fighting the Taliban, and his son later said that seeking revenge for his father's death was his main motivation in going to war.[2][3] Ahmad's uncle was the Afghan Local Police commander in Khas Uruzgan District, Uruzgan province. He had previously been a Taliban commander, but had changed sides in 2012, and was now fighting for the Afghan government.[4] In summer 2015, Khas Uruzgan- his area of control- was besieged by the Taliban, and Samad was injured. 
Ahmad subsequently took command of his uncle's unit.[1][5]

Murder 
Following the siege, Ahmad enrolled into school in the fourth-grade,[1] whilst also receiving private tuition at home.[2] He improved his English, although was not "a good student" – possibly, a neighbour later commented, because he had been "highly encouraged by police officials and awarded medals for his bravery" and only "wanted to play with weapons and drive police vehicles as a hobby."[6] He was authorised to carry a pistol to school.[3] On Monday, 1 February 2015, at the local bazaar,[4] on his way to school,[7] he was shot twice[2] in the head by masked gunmen in a motorbike drive-by shooting, in what has been called a "targeted assassination".[3] He later died in a Kandahar hospital[1] and was buried in the local Shahidano cemetery.[6]

Simon Majola (born 1968), known as The Bruma Lake Killer, is a South African robber and serial killer who, with accomplice Themba Nkosi, was responsible for the killings of at least 8 people in the vicinity of the Bruma Lake in Bruma, Gauteng.[1] Majola was given 8 life sentences, and is currently behind bars.[2] 
Majola, a married man with two children, already had previous convictions for housebreaking, assault and theft before the murders.[3] While partying in Hillbrow, he struck up a friendship with Themba Isaac Nkosi, of Vosloorus.[4] Their relationship quickly turned into a criminal one, with Majola and Nkosi robbing and killing people not only in Bruma Lake, but also in Rhodes Park, Bezuidenhout Park and Observatory Rift Park.[3][5] 
Between April 2000 and February 2001, couples' bodies were turning up in the Bruma Lake. 
Initially considered to be drug-related,[1] the victims were apparently robbed of all cash, jewelry, bank cards, clothes and cell phones,[2] before stones or bricks were tied to their feet and subsequently, they were drowned.[3] Majola and Nkosi would always work as a team, threatening their targets with knives and guns.[4] They always attacked people in the early evenings or late at night at party or picnic spots, while the victims were in their cars.[2] Two of the bodies were in such an advanced state of decomposition that they were unrecognizable, with police additionally believing that they could have been foreigners.[2][3] 
Despite these events terrifying the locals, causing shops to close down and business losing much revenue,[1] a majority of the incidents were never reported to the authorities, as some of the couples attacked were either gay or reluctant to come forward.[2] With the lack of any kind of evidence, including fingerprints, the case proved to be particularly difficult, even when it was handed down to Superintendent Piet Byleveld, a sleuth noted for his successful rate of solving cases.[3] 
On February 8, 2001, two men were arrested in Kensington for the illegal possession of firearms. 
Those two men were Majola and Nkosi. 
When notified of the arrests, Byleveld immediately drove to the station in order to move the criminals to Brixton. 
While in a separate car with Nkosi, he noticed the muscular man, who not so long ago was very cocky and considered his arrest as a joke, suddenly had begun to tremble. 
Later, when questioned separately, both criminals confessed to their crimes, including others of which they weren't suspected: including people robbed in Rhodes Park; the May 15, 2000 murder of a Baptist preacher and the murder of a mutual friend during a failed break-in. 
Majola and Nkosi also killed any associate who discovered what they were up to, killing them in the same way that they did with the other victims.[1] Byleveld managed to connect them to at least 21 murders and attempted murders.[2] 
The duo were brought to trial on September 2002. 
During the process, Nkosi's mother, Ruth Tshehlo, pleaded to the court to be lenient with her "first-born" child, as he was reliable.[1] Meanwhile, Majola denied all charges, blaming his convictions on white supremacy.[2] Neither criminal's tactics worked, as Majola was convicted on 8 counts of murder, 19 of armed robbery, and 5 of attempted murder; while Nkosi was found guilty of 4 murder charges, 14 of armed robbery, five of attempted murder and of assaulting his pregnant then-girlfriend, Jabulile Lushaba, to whom he had bragged of being the "Bruma Lake Killer".[3] Both of them were sentenced to life imprisonment.[2] 
Alfred Themba Qabula (1942–2002) was a poet, writer and trade unionist in Durban, South Africa in the 1980s. He was a fork lift driver and a militant in the Metal and Allied Worker's Union. Qabula is best known as a "worker-poet" who managed the adaptation of traditional Zulu poetic forms to the gritty themes of daily life. 
Qabula took these traditional poetic forms and injected themes from daily life and the workplace, dealing with topics of survival and the fight for unionisation of the workplace.[1] 
Qabula suffered a paralyzing stroke in 1998 and a second attack in 2002 before dying in October of that year.[1] 
"As Qabula has passed on for the 'lands of the high winds,' we must not forget that he died in poverty and that his last words on paper, one finished poem and four unfinished ones, were words marked with bitterness. 
He was deeply disappointed that 'his' revolution was taken over by a world of cell phones and briefcases. 
As he also discovered that his talents as an oral person were lost in the winds of change, these disturbing poems preceded his self-imposed exile. 
"Truly, none of us was spared in these poems — 'The Long Road' is a criticism of all of us on our road to wealth and power, climbing over his back with spiked shoes. 
His 'Of Land, Bones and Money' is one of the most profound expressions of our negotiated settlement — reminding us of the 'restless dead.' 
And that 'seasons of drought have no rainbows.'"[1] 
Works 
Alfred Themba Qabula was born in Flagstaff, Pondoland (part of today's South Africa in 1942. 
His father was a migrant mine worker who died when Alfred was very young.[1]

In 1969 Qabula moved to Durban, where he initially lived in a shack in Amaouti in Inanda.[3] He remained in that city until 1985.[2] 
From 1985 through 1988, Qabula was forced into hiding due to his outspoken support of the United Democratic Front, an organization which fought the continuation of the apartheid system in South Africa.[1] 
Qabula was a key leader of the Durban Workers Cultural Local, a group which sparked broad cultural activity in the trade union movement by sponsoring plays, musical performance, and the literary arts.

Nina Karlovna Bari (Russian: Нина Карловна Бари; 19 November 1901 – 15 July 1961) was a Soviet mathematician known for her work on trigonometric series.[1][2] 
Nina Bari was born in Russia on 19 November 1901, the daughter of Olga and Karl Adolfovich Bari, a physician. In 1918, she became one of the first women to be accepted to the Department of Physics and Mathematics at the prestigious Moscow State University. She graduated in 1921—just three years after entering the university. 
After graduation, Bari began her teaching career. 
She lectured at the Moscow Forestry Institute, the Moscow Polytechnic Institute, and the Sverdlov Communist Institute. Bari applied for and received the only paid research fellowship awarded by the newly created Research Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. 
As a student, Bari was drawn to an elite group nicknamed the Luzitania—an informal academic and social organization. She studied trigonometric series and functions under the tutelage of Nikolai Luzin, becoming one of his star students.[1][2] She presented the main result of her research to the Moscow Mathematical Society in 1922—the first woman to address the society.[3] 
Sergei Nikolaevich Bobokhov (Russian: Сергей Николаевич Бобохов) (1858-16 November 1889) was a Russian revolutionary, who committed suicide as a protest against the flogging of woman comrade in Siberia. 
Born into a wealthy Russian family, he was educated at a gymnasium in Saratov, and as teenager joined the 'to the people' movement when young middle class radicals visited villages hoping to improve the lot of Russian peasants. Unlike many others, he avoided arrest, and in 1875 entered university in St-Petersburg, but was expelled in 1876 and sent back to Saratov for taking part in a student protest. The following year, he was exiled to Arkhangelsk for spreading populist propaganda. 
He was accused of shooting at the police during his arrest, though he claimed that he had fired in the air, hoping that he would be tried in public and would be able to use his trial to expose the arbitrariness of Tsarist rule. He was sentenced to death by a military tribunal in Arkhangel, but because of his youth - he was aged 19 - the sentence was commuted to 20 years hard labour in Kara katorga. He spent ten years in the Kara convict settlement, working in the mines.[1] On hearing of the death of the political prisoner Nadezhda Sigida, who had been subjected to 100 lashes, he was one of 20 male prisoners who poisoned themselves in protest, on 15 November 1889. 
Vladimir Davydov (December 14 [O.S. December 2] 1871 – December 27 [O.S. December 14] 1906) was the second son of Lev and Alexandra Davydov, and nephew of the composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, who called him "Bob".[1] 
Tchaikovsky dedicated his Sixth Symphony, the Pathétique, to Davydov,[1] as well as his Children's Album of piano works, Op. 39.[1] 
Aiza Gazuyeva (1983 – November 29, 2001) was a Chechen woman, known for committing a suicide attack that killed General Gaidar Gadzhiyev, a major general of the Russian Army, on November 29, 2001. Despite being personally motivated and not political, it was one of the first notable shahidka (Chechen female suicide bomber) attacks to occur in Russia, and Gazuyeva became a semi-legendary figure among anti-Russian sentiment in Chechen society. 
Aiza Gazuyeva (also transliterated as Gazueva and variably known as Aizan, Elza, Luisa or Luiza) is believed to have been born around 1983, and between 18 or 20 years-old at the time of her death.[1] Reportedly Gazuyeva had lost 16 relatives in the Second Chechen War, including her husband (to whom she was married only two months earlier), two brothers, and a cousin.[2] Her disabled brother, who had lost both legs to a land mine in the First Chechen War, was shot dead without reason by Russian troops near their family home. The commander of the Russian forces in the area, General Gaidar Gadzhiyev, was very unpopular among locals and was commonly accused of committing atrocities against civilians. 
Allegedly Gadzhiyev had summoned Gazuyeva, where he brutally killed her arrested husband with a knife and then pulling her head into the gaping stomach wound.[3] According to another version, the general told Gazuyeva that he killed her husband with his own hands during an interrogation.[4] 
On November 29, 2001, Gazuyeva approached a group of Russian soldiers including General Gadzhiyev in front of the military commandant's office (Russian: komendatura). 
Reportedly, her last words were: "Do you recognize me?" or "Do you still remember me?" to which Gadzhiyev replied: "I have no time to talk to you!".[2] After the general's answer, Gazuyeva detonated a bundle of hand grenades hidden under her clothes.[5] Gazuyeva and two of Gadzhiyev's bodyguards died instantly, and two other soldiers were injured.[3] Gadzhiyev, who was wearing a flak jacket, was critically wounded (reportedly losing both of his eyes and one arm) and died of his injuries days later on 1 December.[2] 
A wave of severe reprisals by Russian forces were launched against Gazuyeva's family and the local population. Soldiers blew up the home of Gazuyeva and her parents, as well as the houses belonging to at least four other families, while several men from Gazuyev's family were detained and beaten. Soon after the attack, 72 people were detained in the city of Urus-Martan and some of them were reported to having been disappeared. 
One day after Gadzhiyev's death, several people were detained in the village of Alkhan-Yurt in Urus-Martanovsky District, and some of them were later found murdered. 
On December 13, disfigured bodies of several men killed by explosive devices were discovered in Chechnya and later identified as residents of three villages in the Urus-Martan region who had disappeared early in December, including four who were among those detained in Alkhan-Yurt: Lom-Ali Yunusov, his relative Musa Yunusov, Shamil Dzhemaldayev and Aslan Taramov.[6] 
Julius Janonis (4 April 1896 – 30 May 1917) was a Lithuanian poet and writer. Born to a family of poor peasants, he began writing and translating poems at the age of 14. 
Learning from Maironis, he wrote about nature and suffering of the poor. 
His first poems were published in 1912. While still a student, he began contributing articles to Lithuanian press and joined activities of leftist aušrininkai. 
He was a social-democrat but leaned more and more towards communism and his poetry became more and more political agitation. His views become even more radical when during World War I he evacuated to Voronezh and later Petrograd. 
He joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (bolsheviks) and was imprisoned twice for revolutionary activities. 
He contracted tuberculosis and, unwilling to become a burden, committed suicide at age 21. 
In the Lithuanian SSR, Janonis was hailed as the "first poet of the proletariat".

Almir Izmailovich Kayumov (Russian: Альмир Измайлович Каюмов; 30 December 1964 – 7 August 2013) was a Russian football player and referee. 
On November 9, 2009, it was reported that Kayumov attempted to commit suicide by jumping out of his apartment window. 
Police negotiators talked him down, however, and he was brought to a psychiatric hospital.[1][2] Kayumov later denied this, stating that he had just an ordinary treatment.[3] 
Kayumov died on 7 August 2013, when he was hit by a GAZelle truck in Smolensk. According to investigators, his death was a suicide as the surveillance camera footage showed that he jumped in front of the truck.[4] 
Sergei Gustavovich Legat was born on 27 September 1875, in Moscow. The younger brother of Nikolai Legat, he studied at the imperial ballet school with Pavel Gerdt, Christian Johansson, Lev Ivanov and his brother.

Admired for his stylistic performances he also taught, with pupils including Vaslav Nijinsky. Legat originated the dual role of the Nutcracker/Prince in Tchaikovsky's famous ballet. 
He married Marie Petipa (1857–1930). 
Many of the male variations that make up the traditional classical ballet repertory were created especially for him at the turn of the 20th century. 
At the outbreak of the First Russian Revolution, Legat fell out with the authorities, and on 1 November 1905, he committed suicide in Saint Petersburg, slashing his throat with a razor.[1]

Promptov was born in the family of a high-ranking Russian revenue official. He went to school in Kostroma and graduated from the Nechaev gymnasium in Moscow. 
Even as a young boy, he took an interest in birds but he chose to study experimental zoology rather than ornithology. It is thought that his choice may have been aided by family ties to Nikolai Koltsov. Promptov's and Koltsov's mothers were related and Koltsov influenced the authorities to let Promptov study the genetics of fowl under Alexander Serebrovsky, a former student of Koltsov, in a project funded by the People's Commissariat of Agriculture.

He began his career as a comedic actor, with roles in films including The House Bunny and All's Faire in Love, and in the television sitcom Sullivan & Son. Following his career in acting he became a stand-up comedian. 
Benjamin faced increasing difficulty in booking shows after several incidents, including describing an individual as a "child molester" for raising a transgender child and using a racial slur onstage. His political views became more extreme, and he began publishing more political content online. In 2019, he was banned from several mainstream social networks and platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube for violations of their policies on hate speech, and moved to more lenient alt-tech platforms.

Mormonism is the predominant religious tradition of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity. This movement was founded by Joseph Smith in the 1820s. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is the largest branch of the Latter Day Saint movement. 
Mormons are a religious and cultural group related to Mormonism, the principal branch of the Latter Day Saint movement started by Joseph Smith in upstate New York during the 1820s. After Smith's death in 1844 the movement split into several groups following different leaders; the majority followed Brigham Young, while smaller groups followed Joseph Smith III, Sidney Rigdon, and James Strang. Most of these smaller groups eventually coalesced into the Community of Christ, and the term Mormon typically refers to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), as today this branch is far larger than all the others combined. 
(Since 2018, the LDS Church has requested that its members be referred to as "Latter-day Saints".) People who identify as Mormons may also be independently religious, secular and non-practicing, or belong to other denominations.

Ndlovu hails from Jouberton near Klerksdorp.[2] During his formative years, Ndlovu began playing football on the streets and when he was sixteen, he was afforded the opportunity to join an Academy of Excellence. He had to turn down the opportunity, however as it would have left his mother alone at home.[3] He later traveled to Johannesburg where he slept in a train station bathroom for three days in order to attend football trials with Platinum Stars. 
He was offered a contract by the club and initially impressed in front of goal at youth level.[3] His form dipped soon after, however, as the new source of income began to serve as a distraction and Platinum Stars elected not to renew his contract in 2011. At the time he was the breadwinner for his family, which included his pregnant wife.[3] 
On December 12, 2008, a day after Mugabe claimed that the Zimbabwean government had defeated a cholera epidemic, Ndlovu accused the United Kingdom of causing the outbreak in a "racist" attack meant to cause genocide against the Zimbabwean people.[8] 
The Herald reported on January 3, 2009, that Ndlovu had been dismissed from the Cabinet earlier in the week, along with 11 other ministers, because he no longer held any seat in Parliament.[9]

Ndlovu's death was not as widely publicised as Hector Pieterson's because no photographer was present to record it. 
Kleingeld said at the Cillie Commission that Hastings "was inciting the crowd".[1] There is some doubt as to who was the first fatality, as Pieterson was pronounced dead upon arrival at the clinic, whereas Ndlovu died from bullet wounds to the head shortly after being brought to the clinic.

Other citizens had been shot "in error" in a local taxi war.[2] 
The following year, Johnny Clegg and Savuka recorded a final album together: Heat, Dust and Dreams. Clegg dedicated the music video for "The Crossing (Osiyeza)", a song from the album, to Ndlovu.

"We have to break down the misconceptions that exist surrounding Africa. Africa is not just a place of war, poverty, disease and dictators. 
Africa is the birthplace of humanity." 
"I don't always have his patience. 
I could never have spent 27 years in prison and then forgiven my enemies the way he did. But I learned so much from him and I believe he saw a good man in me. I may not be able to walk in the footsteps of Nelson Mandela, but we can all walk in his light." 
“The world looks up to South Africa a lot as a country that is expected to stand on a pedestal of values and morality, because we are a country that produced this great international icon. 
But granddad always taught us to create our own legacies.”

Duma is a violent psychopath who partook of theft, kidnapping, torture, rape and murder. 
He worked as a taxi driver and used his vehicle as a weapon on occasion as well as to obtain his victims. 
Duma’s reasoning, victimology and methodology changed sometimes from victim to victim, indicating that he was a disorganized killer. 
The following day, Duma hijacked, shot and killed two men; Masizane Mtshatsha and Thamsanqua Mbindwane. 
An hour later, now driving in the hijacked VW Polo, Duma kidnapped three further victims; Tsepo Mhlongo, Linda Jali and a teenage girl. The two men were robbed, ordered out of the vehicle, shot and left for dead. 
Duma with his accomplice, Simphiwe Khesi, took the young girl to Azalea Cemetery where they raped her. 
Duma then drove the stolen car over the girl multiple times in order to kill her.[1]

Both men laughed when sentenced saying, "They're dead now. What are they worrying about?"[1] 
"Heterosexual Sodomy" (anal and/or oral sex with an opposite-sex partner) is illegal, Article 388 of the Penal Code. 
As well as all same-sex sexual conduct, Article 338, and "outrages to public decency", Article 333. The punishment for both the first two activities with those under 19 years of age is more severe for the older participant.[2] 
A new penal code which comes into effect in February 2021 adds protections for sexual orientation and removes criminalizing “vices against nature”, which had been used to criminalize same-sex sexual activity.[4] 
The age of consent in Africa for sexual activity varies by jurisdiction across the continent. The specific activity engaged in or the gender of its participants can also affect this age and the legality of sexual activity. 
Below is a discussion of the various laws dealing with this subject. 
The highlighted age refers to an age at or above which an individual can engage in unfettered sexual relations with another person who is also at or above that age. Other variables, for example homosexual and/or sodomy provision(s) that are illegal or close in age exceptions may exist and are stated when relevant. 
The age of consent for homosexual acts ("indecent acts or acts against nature") is 21.[5] 
The age of consent is 18, as of the Penal Code Amendment Bill 2018,[6] Homosexual relationships have been legalized as of July 2019. 
Under the new Penal Code of 2009 (in French), the age of consent in Burundi for heterosexuals (both men and women) is 18 years.[8] However, under Article 567, homosexual acts (both men and women) carry a fine of up to 100,000 Burundian francs and up to 3 years' imprisonment.[9] 
The below is a list of all jurisdictions in Africa as listed in list of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa. 
The age of consent in Egypt is 18 years, for heterosexual males and females. 
This is outlined in article 269 of the penal code.[21] 
Sex work is illegal and the sex work law has been used against male and female homosexuals.[22] 
The age of consent in Eritrea appears to be 18, as stipulated by Article 305 of the 2015 penal code, "Sexual outrage on minors between 15 and 18 years of age". This article states that sexual acts with minors of this age is a petty offense punishable by 6–12 months' imprisonment. 
Many cognates in other languages, such as French sodomie (verb sodomiser), Spanish sodomía (verb sodomizar), and Portuguese sodomia (verb sodomizar), are used exclusively for penetrative anal sex, at least since the early nineteenth century. In those languages, the term is also often current vernacular (not just legal, unlike in other cultures) and a formal way of referring to any practice of anal penetration; the word sex is commonly associated with consent and pleasure with regard to all involved parties and often avoids directly mentioning two common aspects of social taboo — human sexuality and the anus — without a shunning or archaic connotation to its use. 
In modern German, the word Sodomie has no connotation of anal or oral sex and specifically refers to bestiality.[13] The same goes for the Polish sodomia. The Norwegian word sodomi carries both senses. 
In Danish, sodomi is rendered as "unnatural carnal knowledge with someone of the same sex or (now) with animals".[14] 
In Arabic and Persian, the word for sodomy, لواط‎ (Arabic pronunciation: liwāṭ; Persian pronunciation lavât), is derived from the same source as in Western culture, with much the same connotations as English (referring to most sexual acts prohibited by the Qur'an). Its direct reference is to Lot (لوط Lūṭ in Arabic) and a more literal interpretation of the word is "the practice of Lot", but more accurately it means "the practice of Lot's people" (the Sodomites) rather than Lot himself. 
While religion and the law have had a fundamental role in the historical definition and punishment of sodomy, sodomitical texts present considerable opportunities for ambiguity and interpretation. Sodomy is both a real occurrence and an imagined category. In the course of the eighteenth century, what is identifiable as sodomy often becomes identified with effeminacy, for example, or in opposition to a discourse of manliness. 
"an adequate and imaginative reading involves a series of intertextual interventions in which histories become stories, fabrications and reconstructions in lively debate with, and around, 'dominant' heterosexualities ... 
Deconstructing what we think we see may well involve reconstructing ourselves in surprising and unanticipated ways."[15] 
Sodomy (/ˈsɒdəmi/) or buggery (British English) is generally anal or oral sex between people or sexual activity between a person and a non-human animal (bestiality), but it may also mean any non-procreative sexual activity.[1][2][3] Originally, the term sodomy, which is derived from the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in the Book of Genesis,[4] was commonly restricted to anal sex.[5][6] Sodomy laws in many countries criminalized the behavior.[6][7] In the Western world, many of these laws have been overturned or are routinely not enforced. 
The New Testament, like the Old Testament, references Sodom as a place of God's anger against sin, but the Epistle of Jude provides a certain class of sin as causative of its destruction, the meaning of which is disputed. 
The term is derived from the Ecclesiastical Latin peccatum Sodomiticum or "sin of Sodom", which in turn comes from the Ancient Greek word Σόδομα (Sódoma).[8] Genesis (chapters 18–20) tells how God wished to destroy the "sinful" cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Two angels are invited by Lot to take refuge with his family for the night. 
The men of Sodom surround Lot's house and demand that he bring the messengers out so that they may "know" them (the expression includes sexual connotations). Lot protests that the "messengers" are his guests and offers the Sodomites his virgin daughters instead, but then they threaten to "do worse" with Lot than they would with his guests. Then the angels strike the Sodomites blind, "so that they wearied themselves to find the door" (Genesis 19:4-11, KJV). 
Justinian's interpretation of the story of Sodom might have been forgotten today (as some[who?] hold it had been, along with his law novelizations regarding homosexual behavior immediately after his death) had it not been made use of in fake Charlemagnian capitularies, fabricated by a Frankish monk using the pseudonym Benedictus Levita ("Benedict the Levite") around 850 AD, as part of the Pseudo-Isidore. Benedict Levita's three capitularies, particularly dealing with Justinian's interpretation of the story of Sodom, were: 
("No. 21: On manifold disgraceful wrongs") CXLIII. 
("No. 143: On sinful vices due to which empires have crumbled, so that we shall do our best to beware of them") CLX. 
("No. 160: On the perpetrators of manifold evil deeds") 
Burning had been part of the standard penalty for homosexual behavior, particularly common in Germanic protohistory (as according to Germanic folklore, sexual deviance and especially same-sex desire were caused by a form of malevolence or spiritual evil called nith, rendering those people characterized by it as non-human fiends, as nithings). Benedictus Levita most probably was of the Germanic tribe of the Franks.[citation needed] 
Benedictus Levita broadened the meaning for sodomy to all sexual acts not related to procreation that were therefore deemed counter nature (so for instance, even solitary masturbation and anal intercourse between a male and a female were covered), while among these, he still emphasized all interpersonal acts not taking place between human men and women, especially homosexuality.[citation needed] 
Benedictus Levita’s rationale was that the punishment of such acts was in order to protect all Christianity from divine punishments, such as natural disasters for carnal sins committed by individuals, but also for heresy, superstition, and heathenry. Because his crucial demands for capital punishment had been so unheard of in ecclesiastical history previously, based upon the humane Christian concept of forgiveness and mercy, it took several centuries before Benedictus Levita’s demands for legal reform began to take tangible shape within larger ecclesiastical initiatives. 
The sects of Cathars and Waldensians were a common target, and these heretics were not only persecuted for alleged satanism, but were increasingly accused of fornication and sodomy. In 1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges levelled during the Trial of the Knights Templar. Some of these charges were specifically directed at the Grand Master of the order, Jacques de Molay.[40] It is this event which led into the medieval and early-modern witch hunts that were also largely connoted with sodomy.[41] 
Persecution of Cathars and the Bogomiles sect in Bulgaria led to the use of a term closely related to sodomy: buggery derives from French bouggerie, meaning "of Bulgaria".[42] The association of sodomy with hereticism, satanism, and witchcraft was supported by the Inquisition trials.[43] 
The Book of Wisdom, which is included in the Biblical canon by Orthodox and Roman Catholics, but excluded by modern Jews, Protestants, and other Christian denominations, makes reference to the story of Sodom, further emphasizing that their sin had been failing to practice hospitality: 
"And punishments came upon the sinners not without former signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness, insomuch as they used a more hard and hateful behavior toward strangers." 
"For the Sodomites did not receive those, whom they knew not when they came: but these brought friends into bondage, that had well deserved of them." 
(KJV[44] 
An examination of trials for rape and sodomy during the 18th century at the Old Bailey in London shows that the treatment of rape was often lenient, while the treatment of sodomy was often severe. 
However, the difficulty of proving that penetration and ejaculation had occurred meant that men were often convicted of the lesser charge of "assault with sodomitical intent," which was not a capital offence.[45] Sodomy crimes in England could mean "sexually assaulting a young child," and could result in a sentence of death recorded, i.e., not an actual death sentence at all.[46] 
Records from the Bastille and the police lieutenant d'Argenson, as well as other sources, show that many who were arrested were exiled, sent to a regiment, or imprisoned in places (generally the hospital) associated with moral crimes (such as prostitution). Of these, a number were involved in prostitution or had approached children, or otherwise gone beyond merely having homosexual relations. Ravaisson (a 19th-century writer who edited the Bastille records) suggested that the authorities preferred to handle these cases discreetly, lest public punishments in effect publicize "this vice."[citation needed] 
Periodicals of the time sometimes casually named known sodomites, and at one point, even suggested that sodomy was increasingly popular. This does not imply that sodomites necessarily lived in security—specific police agents, for instance, watched the Tuileries, even then a known “cruising area.” But, as with much sexual behaviour under the Old Regime, discretion was a key concern on all sides (especially since members of prominent families were sometimes implicated); the law seemed most concerned with those who were the least discreet.[citation needed] 
In current usage, the term is particularly used in law. Laws prohibiting sodomy were seen frequently in past Jewish, Christian, and Islamic civilizations, but the term has little modern usage outside Africa, Asia, and the United States.[9] 
Laws criminalizing sodomy rarely spell out precise sexual acts, but are typically understood by courts to include any sexual act deemed to be unnatural or immoral.[50] Sodomy typically includes anal sex, oral sex, and bestiality.[51][52][53] In practice, sodomy laws have rarely been enforced against heterosexual couples, and have mostly been used to target homosexuals.[54] 
As of June 2019, 69 countries as well as five sub-national jurisdictions[lower-alpha 1] have laws criminalizing homosexuality.[55] In 2006 that number was 92.[56] Among these 69 countries, 44 of them criminalize not only male homosexuality but also female homosexuality. 
In 11 of them, homosexuality is punished with the death penalty.[55] 
These laws in the United States have been challenged and have sometimes been found unconstitutional or been replaced with different legislation.[10] 
The traditional interpretation sees the primary sin of Sodom as being homoerotic sexual acts,[59][60] connecting the Sodom narrative with Leviticus 18, which lists various sexual crimes, which, according to verses 27 and 28, would result in the land being "defiled": 
for the inhabitants of the land, who were before you, committed all of these abominations, and the land became defiled; otherwise the land will vomit you out for defiling it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you. 
Some scholars, such as Per-Axel Sverker, align this passage with the traditional interpretation, claiming that the word abomination refers to sexual misconduct, and that while homoerotic acts were not the only reason Sodom and Gomorrah were condemned, it was a significant part of the picture. 
Others, the earliest of whom was Derrick Sherwin Bailey, claim that this passage contradicts the traditional interpretation altogether. 
In their view, the sins of Sodom were related more to violation of hospitality laws than sexual sins.[61] This also coincides with traditional Jewish interpretations of these texts as well.[62] 
While the Quran clearly disapproves of the sexual practices of the "people of Lot" ("What, of all creatures do ye come unto the males, and leave the wives your Lord created for you?"[69]), only one passage has occasionally been interpreted as taking a particular legal position towards such activities:[70] 
"And as for those who are guilty of an indecency from among your women, call to witnesses against them four (witnesses) from among you; then if they bear witness confine them to the houses until death takes them away or Allah opens some way for them (15). And as for the two who are guilty of indecency from among you, give them both a punishment; then if they repent and amend, turn aside from them; surely Allah is oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful. (16)"[4:15–16 (Translated by Shakir)] 
The word sod, a noun or verb (to "sod off") used as an insult, is derived from sodomite.[11][12] It is a general-purpose insult term for anyone the speaker dislikes without specific reference to their sexual behaviour. 
Sod is used as slang in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth and is considered mildly offensive. (The word 'sod' also has a meaning of "(clump of) earth" with an unrelated etymology, in which sense it is rare but not offensive.) 
They were predominantly effeminate gay men who worked either in entertainment or as waiters on cruise ships, often becoming off-shore 'wives' for heterosexual sailors for the duration of voyages. They could also be found within the Navy as the nonfiction historical monograph Hello Sailor! The Hidden History of Gay Life at Sea describes through the stories and experiences of sea queens from the Navy. 
They used it as an outlet of freedom where they could express themselves, whether that was through different clothing or other traits and were able to do this without the fear of being discriminated against.[1] Joining the Navy was an escape for individuals who identified as gay and didn't want to hide their sexuality. They could go and express themselves how they truly wanted and be surrounded by others who felt the same as them. This contradicted the life that gay men would have back on land. 
Gay men that didn't want to hide joined the navy to be open about themselves. As the numbers rose, it created a community of gay men. Since gay men on land were forced to stay in hiding, many wouldn't know about other men who were gay, making it highly unlikely for communities to form like the ones in the Navy. 
Polari was a coded language used by gay men that used metaphors and coded or made up words to talk about the topic of homosexuality without others around them knowing.[2] The secret language could be used to talk about their sexuality without others picking up on their conversation and outing them for being gay. It was even used by certain radio shows to tell gay jokes without anyone realizing what they were airing. Gay men that used Polari often called themselves "queen" which can be drawn in relevance to the use of sea queens. 
Many other events can be linked to a surge in the gay population, but it didn't always end with a positive story to tell. One important event can be recalled from an instance in Newport, Rhode Island where gay, male sailors were being targeted by the military, discriminated against, and were even being arrested if they were found gay.[3] The government began attacking gay men and were purposely searching for them. In many cases there was very little evidence against these men creating a higher chance of them being found gay, even if it was through the smallest inclination that they could be gay. 
Pride House is a dedicated temporary location which plays host to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) athletes, volunteers and visitors attending the Olympics, Paralympics or other international sporting event in the host city. The first was organized for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. 
The Vancouver location of Pride House was housed within Qmunity center.[1] During the 2010 Winter Olympics, the Vancouver and Whistler Pride Houses served as venues for LGBT sportspeople, coaches, visitors and their friends, families and supporters, and became the first Pride Houses at an Olympics.[1][2][3] Although both Pride Houses offered information and support services to LGBT athletes and attendees, the Whistler location in Pan Pacific Village Centre had a "celebratory theme", while the Vancouver venue emphasised education about Vancouver's LGBT community and, for non-Canadian athletes, information about immigration to and asylum in Canada, including "legal resources" from Egale Canada and the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (IGLA).[2][4]

Thabong (meaning 'place of happiness' in Southern Sotho) is the second largest township after botshabelo in the Free State province in South Africa. The township was established during the years of segregation of black people as well as the township of Bronville for coloured people adjacent to the city of Welkom, to accommodate workers at the world's richest gold mines. 
Today the townships of Thabong and Bronville have a population of approximately 200,000 residents. Usually Thabong is referred to the combination of both Thabong and Bronville (former Coloured township) though Bronville is classified as an independent township of Welkom. 
People from both Thabong and Bronville do their shopping in Welkom, however, at the rate at which the township of Thabong is growing a new shopping mall, "Boitumelo Junction" has been opened. At 25,500 m2, it is anchored by Shoprite, Boxer and the usual others. 
The most fashionable and lovely place of interest especially during December Holidays is Shopong Tsa Kgale meaning 'Old shops' That's where Thabong Kids figuratively or 'Black Diamonds' meet to enjoy themselves especially the ones who have moved out of Thabong to places like Johannesburg, Sandton, Randburg, Roodepoort, Pretoria, etc.

The foot (plural: feet) is an anatomical structure found in many vertebrates. It is the terminal portion of a limb which bears weight and allows locomotion. In many animals with feet, the foot is a separate[clarification needed] organ at the terminal part of the leg made up of one or more segments or bones, generally including claws or nails. 
There can be many sesamoid bones near the metatarsophalangeal joints, although they are only regularly present in the distal portion of the first metatarsal bone.[4] 
The human foot has two longitudinal arches and a transverse arch maintained by the interlocking shapes of the foot bones, strong ligaments, and pulling muscles during activity. The slight mobility of these arches when weight is applied to and removed from the foot makes walking and running more economical in terms of energy. 
As can be examined in a footprint, the medial longitudinal arch curves above the ground. This arch stretches from the heel bone over the "keystone" ankle bone to the three medial metatarsals. In contrast, the lateral longitudinal arch is very low. 
With the cuboid serving as its keystone, it redistributes part of the weight to the calcaneus and the distal end of the fifth metatarsal. The two longitudinal arches serve as pillars for the transverse arch which run obliquely across the tarsometatarsal joints. Excessive strain on the tendons and ligaments of the feet can result in fallen arches or flat feet.[5] 
The muscles acting on the foot can be classified into extrinsic muscles, those originating on the anterior or posterior aspect of the lower leg, and intrinsic muscles, originating on the dorsal (top) or plantar (base) aspects of the foot. 
All muscles originating on the lower leg except the popliteus muscle are attached to the bones of the foot. The tibia and fibula and the interosseous membrane separate these muscles into anterior and posterior groups, in their turn subdivided into subgroups and layers. [6] 
Etymology 
The word "foot", in the sense of meaning the "terminal part of the leg of a vertebrate animal" comes from "Old English fot "foot," from Proto-Germanic *fot (source also of Old Frisian fot, Old Saxon fot, Old Norse fotr, Danish fod, Swedish fot, Dutch voet, Old High German fuoz, German Fuß, Gothic fotus "foot"), from PIE root *ped- "foot."[1] The "plural form feet is an instance of i-mutation."[1] 
In anatomy, pronation is a rotational movement of the forearm (at the radioulnar joint) or foot (at the subtalar and talocalcaneonavicular joints). Pronation of the foot refers to how the body distributes weight as it cycles through the gait. During the gait cycle the foot can pronate in many different ways based on rearfoot and forefoot function. 
An individual who neutrally pronates initially strikes the ground on the lateral side of the heel. As the individual transfers weight from the heel to the metatarsus, the foot will roll in a medial direction, such that the weight is distributed evenly across the metatarsus. In this stage of the gait, the knee will generally, but not always, track directly over the hallux. 
This rolling inwards motion as the foot progresses from heel to toe is the way that the body naturally absorbs shock. Neutral pronation is the most ideal, efficient type of gait when using a heel strike gait; in a forefoot strike, the body absorbs shock instead via flexation of the foot. 
As with a neutral pronator, an individual who overpronates initially strikes the ground on the lateral side of the heel. As the individual transfers weight from the heel to the metatarsus, however, the foot will roll too far in a medial direction, such that the weight is distributed unevenly across the metatarsus, with excessive weight borne on the hallux. In this stage of the gait, the knee will generally, but not always, track inwards. 
The feet of a newborn infant. 
Underpronation (supination) 
An individual who underpronates also initially strikes the ground on the lateral side of the heel. As the individual transfers weight from the heel to the metatarsus, the foot will not roll far enough in a medial direction. 
The weight is distributed unevenly across the metatarsus, with excessive weight borne on the fifth metatarsal, towards the lateral side of the foot. In this stage of the gait, the knee will generally, but not always, track laterally of the hallux. 
The word "foot" is used to refer to a "...linear measure was in Old English (the exact length has varied over time), this being considered the length of a man's foot; a unit of measure used widely and anciently. In this sense the plural is often foot. 
The current inch and foot are implied from measurements in 12c."[1] The word "foot" also has a musical meaning; a "...metrical foot (late Old English, translating Latin pes, Greek pous in the same sense) is commonly taken to represent one rise and one fall of a foot: keeping time according to some, dancing according to others."[1] 
Masipa contributed to case law on the constitutional duties of local government related to housing in her 2009 ruling on Blue Moonlight Properties v Occupiers of Saratoga Avenue.[1] 
Masipa was the presiding judge in the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp and several gun-related charges which commenced in the High Court in Pretoria on 3 March 2014.[1][22] She appointed two assessors to assist her in the trial.[23] According to the spokesperson for the South African judiciary, she was not specially assigned to the case because of her gender.[24][25] Following her assignment to the high-profile case, her colleagues reportedly described her as respected, competent, eloquent, and reserved.[7][26] According to media monitoring company ROi Africa, the majority of social media comments during the delivery of the verdict were critical of Judge Masipa after it became evident that Pistorius would not be found guilty of murder, a decision which was later overturned by the Appeal Court and a murder verdict recorded. Judge Masipa, who was given police protection from the beginning of the trial, was subjected to threats and personal attacks by people who disagreed with the verdict.[27][28] In her new sentence for Pistorius based on a murder conviction, Masipa only increased his sentence by 1 year to 6 years. The 6 year sentence for murder was appealed by the National Prosecuting Authority and they convinced South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal to increase the sentence. 
Thokozile Matilda Masipa (born 16 October 1947) is a judge in the Gauteng Division of the High Court of South Africa. She was the presiding judge in the 2014 trial of Oscar Pistorius for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp. Her verdict of not guilty of murder was later overturned on appeal. 
Masipa was born and grew up in Orlando East, Soweto, Johannesburg, the eldest of 10 children. After matriculating from Immaculata High School in the Alexandra township in 1966, she obtained a BA degree specialising in Social Work in 1974 and a LLB in 1990 from the University of South Africa. 
She was admitted as an advocate in 1991.[1][3] 
Prior to her law career, Masipa worked as a social worker and as a crime reporter, which led to her interest in law. She worked for The World, Post and The Sowetan newspapers and edited the Queen women's supplement of Pace magazine.[5][6][7][8] 
In 1998, she was appointed as a judge in the Transvaal Provincial Division (as it was then known) of the High Court of South Africa,[1][9][10][11] becoming the second black woman to be appointed as a judge in the High Court after Lucy Mailula, who was appointed to the Transvaal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court (as it was then known) in 1995.[12][13][14][15] Masipa has also served in Gauteng's consumer court tribunal,[16] the Estate Agents Board,[17] and the Electoral Court of South Africa.[18][19] 
In a 2003 interview with the Judicial Service Commission, Masipa supported greater transparency and interaction with the media to aid the public's understanding of the judicial process.[20] She is one of the seven female South African judges featured in Courting Justice, a 2008 documentary film directed by Jane Lipman.[4][21]

Mosia is a South African-Ghanaian entrepreneur and co-founder of the Sierra Leone-based solar energy company Easy Solar.[1] 
Mosia was born in Ghana, later moving to South Africa. As a teenager she occasionally experienced blackouts due to unreliable supply of electricity, which first sparked her interest in energy.[2][2] Mosia gained a Bachelor of Business Science in Finance and Economics from the University of Cape Town, graduating with first class honors and distinction, subsequently working as a management consultant across Africa.[4][5][6] In 2016 she studied for a Master's degree focused on Clean Energy Finance and Policy at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, where she met her co-founders of Easy Solar, Eric Silverman and Alexandre Tourre.[2][3][5][7] 
Mosia and her co-founders conceived of the idea for providing reliable and affordable electricity to households underserved by the grid in West Africa, during their graduate studies. Together they won major funding for the project from competitions and hackathons in the US, such as the D-Prize in 2015 and the Columbia Venture Competition 2016. Initial funding allowed Mosia and her colleagues to conduct a survey of energy availability across 1,500 Sierra Leonean households.[1] 
Easy Solar, trading internationally as Azimuth, was created in 2016 as a commercial initiative to extend the reach of high-quality solar energy devices (such as lanterns and home systems) across under-provided Sierra Leone.[3][8] The company offers financial initiatives, such as rent-to-own, on a pay-as-you-go basis to help poorer households afford their own solar panels.[3][9][10]

A conductor directs a musical performance; conducting has been defined as "the art of directing the simultaneous performance of several players or singers by the use of gesture." The conductor stands on a raised podium and communicates with the musicians through hand gestures or eye contact. 
Examples of performers include, but are not limited to, instrumentalists and singers who perform for an audience. A musician can perform as a solo artist or as a part of an ensemble (e.g. an orchestra, a choir or a pop group). 
A musician is a person who composes, conducts, or performs music.[1] According to the United States Employment Service, "musician" is a general term used to designate one who follows music as a profession.[2] Musicians include songwriters who compose music as well as write lyrics for songs, conductors who direct a musical performance, or performers who perform for an audience. A music performer is generally either a singer who provides vocals or an instrumentalist who plays a musical instrument. Musicians may perform on their own or as part of a group, band or orchestra. 
Musicians specialize in a musical style, and some musicians play in a variety of different styles depending on cultures and background. A musician who records and releases music can be known as a recording artist.[3] 
A composer is a musician who creates musical compositions. The title is principally used for those who write classical music or film music. Those who write the music for popular songs may be called songwriters (Those who mainly write the words for songs may be referred to as lyricists). 
Guitars can be divided into two broad categories, acoustic and electric guitars. Within each of these categories, there are also further sub-categories. For example, an electric guitar can be purchased in a six-string model (the most common model) or in seven- or twelve-string models. 
The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. 
It is held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum or individual finger picks may be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.

Male prostitution is the act or practice of men providing sexual services in return for payment. It is a form of sex work. Although clients can be any gender, the vast majority are male.[1] Compared to female prostitutes, male prostitutes have been far less studied by researchers.[2] 
The terms used for male prostitutes generally differ from those used for females. Some terms vary by clientele or method of business. Where prostitution is illegal or taboo, it is common for male prostitutes to use euphemisms which present their business as providing companionship, nude modeling or dancing, body massage, or some other acceptable fee-for-service arrangement. 
Thus one may be referred to as a male escort, gigolo (implying female customers), rent boy, hustler (more common for those soliciting in public places), model, or masseur.[3] A man who does not regard himself as gay or bisexual, but who has sex with male clients for money, is sometimes called gay-for-pay, or trade. 
Male clients, especially those who pick up prostitutes on the street or in bars, are sometimes called johns or tricks.[4] Those working in prostitution, especially street prostitutes, sometimes refer to the act of prostitution as turning tricks.

The sister company of e.tv, Platco Digital, launched the Openview HD platform on 16 October 2013.[3] The main reason was that the digital migration in South Africa was at a slow pace: Companies given tenders took too long to deliver, funding of subsidised decoders, and a debate between the major TV channels of whether DTT decoders should have conditional access or not.

Channel O is a South African-based music channel which first started transmission in 1997. Its main concept is African music in Africa and the diaspora. 
Channel O can be accessed via DStv, a satellite pay TV service for pan-African households. The channel broadcasts a variety of music videos. 
Channel O, over the past years, has been losing a significant amount of popularity due to mainly the launches of MTV Base Africa, Trace Urban and Trace Africa. The channel has been trying several means to gain popularity including the increasingly popular method of creating a South African feed and a Rest of Africa feed (MTV Base and Trace have also adopted this) 
Trace Africa, Africa’s number one music channel, is dedicated to playing and showcasing music of Africa’s top artists and genres including Afro-pop, Coupé Décalé, Kwaito House, Afro-trap, Makossa, N’dombolo through radio and live concert events. Trace Africa is a smaller section of the larger Trace brand, a company dedicated to spreading music, news and culture throughout the African Diaspora. Trace Africa the radio show first premiered on DStv, in 2016 as a replacement to Trace Sports Stars through the whole continent and as of 2017 is also now on StarSat[1] 
Since music for Trace Africa is selected and researched from local and international artists at one of the three Trace sites located in South Africa, Cameroon and Nigeria, local artists are set to benefit greatly from the growth of Trace Africa. Those from Zimbabwe have especially benefited from Trace Africa’s methods of finding music. Zimbabwean artists have often been suppressed in the shadow of more well-known Nigerian and South African artists, and Trace Africa has now become the platform where many artists can showcase their talents and put themselves on the map. 
Furthermore, with the new trace Africa geography-based channels, Zimbabweans and other artists who have often been overshadowed now have the chance to be seen. This also increases creativity and productivity in local artists.[6]

Queen Ntfombi, The Queen Mother, Ndlovukati of Eswatini (born Ntfombi Tfwala in 1950) is the current Ndlovukati and joint head of state of Eswatini, serving since 1986. 
She was also regent of Eswatini from 1983 to 1986. 
She is the mother of King Mswati III.[1] 
Ntfombi was born in 1950. 
She married King Sobhuza II of Swaziland, with whom she had a son, Prince Makhosetive Dlamini. 
In 1982 King Sobhuza designated another of his wives, Queen Dzeliwe, as the Indlovukati to reign as joint sovereign with his future successor. Instead of recognizing one of her sons as his heir apparent, he indicated to his Loqoqo that he wanted Prince Makhosetive Dlamini to succeed him on the throne. 
In June 1982 he also extended the authority of the Loqoqo, empowering it to act as a "Supreme Council of State", free to appoint an "Authorised Person" to exercise the royal prerogative if a regent was deemed unable to do so properly. 
In the power vacuum that resulted from the death of Sobhuza II, Indlovukati Dzeliwe became Queen Regent during the minority of the designated heir to the throne, but the Loqoqo, consisting mostly of King Sobhuza's senior relatives, chiefs and advisors, usurped her authority and sacked Sobhuza's prime minister, Prince Mabandla Dlamini, whom Loqoqo members apparently feared would strip them of their new role. Once Prince Makhosetive Dlamini attained his majority and officially became king, his mother would then be expected to be designated as the new Indlovukati.[2] However, Queen Dzeliwe was placed under house arrest in 1983. Following a 9-day period during which Swaziland was ruled by Prince Sozisa Dlamini, Ntfombi was selected as queen regent.

A writer is a person who uses written words in different styles and techniques to communicate ideas. Writers produce different forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, books, poetry, plays, screenplays, teleplays, songs, and essays as well as other reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. 
Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.[1] 
The term "writer" is also used elsewhere in the arts and music – such as songwriter or a screenwriter – but as a standalone "writer" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition. 
Writers can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional. Other writers use multiple media – for example, graphics or illustration – to enhance the communication of their ideas. Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers, whose skills create understandable, interpretive documents of a practical or scientific kind. 
Some writers may use images (drawing, painting, graphics) or multimedia to augment their writing. In rare instances, creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words.[2] 
In Ancient Rome, professional poets were generally sponsored by patrons, wealthy supporters including nobility and military officials.[3] For instance, Gaius Cilnius Maecenas, friend to Caesar Augustus, was an important patron for the Augustan poets, including both Horace and Virgil. While Ovid, a well established poet, was banished from Rome by the first Augustus. 
In the High Middle Ages, troubadors were an important class of poets and came from a variety of backgrounds. They lived and travelled in many different places and were looked upon as actors or musicians as much as poets. They were often under patronage, but many travelled extensively. 
The Renaissance period saw a continuation of patronage of poets by royalty. Many poets, however, had other sources of income, including Italians like Dante Aligheri, Giovanni Boccaccio and Petrarch's works in a pharmacist's guild and William Shakespeare's work in the theater. 
In the Romantic period and onwards, many poets were independent writers who made their living through their work, often supplemented by income from other occupations or from family.[4] This included poets such as William Wordsworth and Robert Burns. 
Poets such as Virgil in the Aeneid and John Milton in Paradise Lost invoked the aid of a Muse. 
Poets of earlier times were often well read and highly educated people while others were to a large extent self-educated. A few poets such as John Gower and John Milton were able to write poetry in more than one language. 
Some Portuguese poets, as Francisco de Sá de Miranda, wrote not only in Portuguese but also in Spanish.[5] Jan Kochanowski wrote in Polish and in Latin,[6] France Prešeren and Karel Hynek Mácha[7] wrote some poems in German, although they were poets of Slovenian and Czech respectively. 
Adam Mickiewicz, the greatest poet of Polish language, wrote a Latin ode for emperor Napoleon III. Another example is Jerzy Pietrkiewicz, a Polish poet. 
When he moved to Great Britain, he ceased to write poetry in Polish, but started writing novel in English.[8] He also translated poetry from English and into English. 
Lyrical poets who write sacred poetry ("hymnographers") differ from the usual image of poets in a number of ways. 
A hymnographer such as Isaac Watts who wrote 700 poems in his lifetime, may have their lyrics sung by millions of people every Sunday morning, but are not always included in anthologies of poetry. Because hymns are perceived of as "worship" rather than "poetry," the term "artistic kenosis" is sometimes used to describe the hymnographer's success in "emptying out" the instinct to succeed as a poet. A singer in the pew might have several of Watts's stanzas memorized, without ever knowing his name or thinking of him as a poet. 
A poet is a person who creates poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. 
A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience. 
The work of a poet is essentially one of communication, either expressing ideas in a literal sense, such as writing about a specific event or place, or metaphorically. 
Poets have existed since antiquity, in nearly all languages, and have produced works that vary greatly in different cultures and periods.[1] Throughout each civilization and language, poets have used various styles that have changed through the course of literary history, resulting in a history of poets as diverse as the literature they have produced. 
Poetry (derived from the Greek poiesis, "making") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and often rhythmic[1][2][3] qualities of language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning. 
Forms of odes appear in many of the cultures that were influenced by the Greeks and Latins.[129] The ode generally has three parts: a strophe, an antistrophe, and an epode. 
Odes are often intended to be recited or sung by two choruses (or individuals), with the first reciting the strophe, the second the antistrophe, and both together the epode.[130] Over time, differing forms for odes have developed with considerable variations in form and structure, but generally showing the original influence of the Pindaric or Horatian ode. 
One non-Western form which resembles the ode is the qasida in Persian poetry.[131]

Dlamini-Sangweni has two children. 
In 1994, she married Mhlengi Moses Sangweni, until their divorce in 1997. She has a son, Makhosini "Omari" Dlamini, born 1 December 1991, and a daughter, Nikita Dlamini, born 1995. 
She is currently a member of the African National Congress and is Chairwoman of Purple Tree Holdings, a private company. Dlamini-Sangweni is a Principal Princess of the Nhlangwini royal family, Princess of the Zulu Royal Family and is a cousin of Mswati III, King of Swaziland. She has assets estimated at US$30 million from various investments and shareholdings on the New York Stock Exchange and Johannesburg Stock Exchange. 
Dlamini-Sangweni was the first black and first female director of the Constitutional Court of South Africa, in which she served from 2002 to 2005. She then served as the executive advisor of Smangaliso Mkhatshwa, before serving as The Chief State Law Advisor of the Eastern Cape Province from 2013 to 2017.[1][2] 
Dlamini-Sangweni was born in Ixopo. 
Her parents were Inkosi C Dlamini and Inkosikati H Dlamini. At the age of two her family moved to Umzinto, and in 1980, she graduated from Sacred Heart College for Girls, Verulam.[3] 
In 1993, Dlamini-Sangweni received a B. Proc degree in Law from the University of Natal.[1] In 2005, she served as the executive advisor of Smangaliso Mkhatshwa, the executive Mayor of Pretoria.

Empaneled with visiting royalty from Cameroon and Ethiopia (Prince Ermias Sahle Selassie), she described the cultural leadership exercised by reigning and deposed royalty among members of ethnic communities living in either ancestral lands or diaspora in the United Kingdom. 
In English, anime—when used as a common noun—normally functions as a mass noun. 
(For example: "Do you watch anime?" or "How much anime have you collected?")[11] As with a few other Japanese words, such as saké and Pokémon, English texts sometimes spell anime as animé (as in French), with an acute accent over the final e, to cue the reader to pronounce the letter, not to leave it silent as English orthography may suggest. 
Prior to the widespread use of anime, the term Japanimation was prevalent throughout the 1970s and 1980s. 
In the mid-1980s, the term anime began to supplant Japanimation;[12] in general, the latter term now only appears in period works where it is used to distinguish and identify Japanese animation.[13] 
Emakimono and kagee are considered precursors of Japanese animation.[14] Emakimono was common in the eleventh century. 
Traveling storytellers narrated legends and anecdotes while the emakimono was unrolled from the right to left with chronological order, as a moving panorama.[14] Kagee was popular during the Edo period and originated from the shadows play of China.[14] Magic lanterns from the Netherlands were also popular in the eighteenth century.[14] The paper play called Kamishibai surged in the twelfth century and remained popular in the street theater until the 1930s.[14] Puppets of the bunraku theater and ukiyo-e prints are considered ancestors of characters of most Japanese animations.[14] Finally, mangas were a heavy inspiration for Japanese anime. 
Cartoonists Kitzawa Rakuten and Okamoto Ippei used film elements in their strips.[14] 
A frame from Namakura Gatana (1917), the oldest surviving Japanese animated short film made for cinemas 
Animation in Japan began in the early 20th century, when filmmakers started to experiment with techniques pioneered in France, Germany, the United States, and Russia.[10] A claim for the earliest Japanese animation is Katsudō Shashin (c. 1907),[15] a private work by an unknown creator.[16] In 1917, the first professional and publicly displayed works began to appear; animators such as Ōten Shimokawa, Seitarō Kitayama, and Jun'ichi Kōuchi (considered the "fathers of anime") produced numerous films, the oldest surviving of which is Kōuchi's Namakura Gatana.[17] Many early works were lost with the destruction of Shimokawa's warehouse in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.[18] 
By the mid-1930s animation was well-established in Japan as an alternative format to the live-action industry. 
It suffered competition from foreign producers, such as Disney, and many animators, including Noburō Ōfuji and Yasuji Murata, continued to work with cheaper cutout animation rather than cel animation.[19] Other creators, including Kenzō Masaoka and Mitsuyo Seo, nevertheless made great strides in technique, benefiting from the patronage of the government, which employed animators to produce educational shorts and propaganda.[20] In 1940, the government dissolved several artists' organizations to form the Shin Nippon Mangaka Kyōkai.[lower-alpha 1][21] The first talkie anime was Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka (1933), a short film produced by Masaoka.[22][23] The first feature-length anime film was Momotaro: Sacred Sailors (1945), produced by Seo with a sponsorship from the Imperial Japanese Navy.[24] The 1950s saw a proliferation of short, animated advertisements created for television.[25] 
In the 1960s, manga artist and animator Osamu Tezuka adapted and simplified Disney animation techniques to reduce costs and limit frame counts in his productions.[26] Originally intended as temporary measures to allow him to produce material on a tight schedule with an inexperienced staff, many of his limited animation practices came to define the medium's style.[27] Three Tales (1960) was the first anime film broadcast on television;[28] the first anime television series was Instant History (1961–64).[29] An early and influential success was Astro Boy (1963–66), a television series directed by Tezuka based on his manga of the same name. 
Many animators at Tezuka's Mushi Production later established major anime studios (including Madhouse, Sunrise, and Pierrot). 
The 1970s saw growth in the popularity of manga, many of which were later animated. 
Tezuka's work—and that of other pioneers in the field—inspired characteristics and genres that remain fundamental elements of anime today. 
The giant robot genre (also known as "mecha"), for instance, took shape under Tezuka, developed into the super robot genre under Go Nagai and others, and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by Yoshiyuki Tomino, who developed the real robot genre.[30] Robot anime series such as Gundam and Super Dimension Fortress Macross became instant classics in the 1980s, and the genre remained one of the most popular in the following decades.[31] The bubble economy of the 1980s spurred a new era of high-budget and experimental anime films, including Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984), Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise (1987), and Akira (1988).[32] 
Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995), a television series produced by Gainax and directed by Hideaki Anno, began another era of experimental anime titles, such as Ghost in the Shell (1995) and Cowboy Bebop (1998). 
In the 1990s, anime also began attracting greater interest in Western countries; major international successes include Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball Z, both of which were dubbed into more than a dozen languages worldwide. 
In 2003, Spirited Away, a Studio Ghibli feature film directed by Hayao Miyazaki, won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards. 
It later became the highest-grossing anime film,[lower-alpha 2] earning more than $355 million. 
Since the 2000s, an increased number of anime works have been adaptations of light novels and visual novels; successful examples include The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Fate/stay night (both 2006). 
Anime differs greatly from other forms of animation by its diverse art styles, methods of animation, its production, and its process. 
Visually, anime works exhibit a wide variety of art styles, differing between creators, artists, and studios.[33] While no single art style predominates anime as a whole, they do share some similar attributes in terms of animation technique and character design. 
Modern anime follows a typical animation production process, involving storyboarding, voice acting, character design, and cel production. 
Since the 1990s, animators have increasingly used computer animation to improve the efficiency of the production process. 
Early anime works were experimental, and consisted of images drawn on blackboards, stop motion animation of paper cutouts, and silhouette animation.[1][35] Cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium. 
In the 21st century, the use of other animation techniques is mostly limited to independent short films,[36] including the stop motion puppet animation work produced by Tadahito Mochinaga, Kihachirō Kawamoto and Tomoyasu Murata.[37][38] Computers were integrated into the animation process in the 1990s, with works such as Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke mixing cel animation with computer-generated images.[39] Fuji Film, a major cel production company, announced it would stop cel production, producing an industry panic to procure cel imports and hastening the switch to digital processes.[39] 
Prior to the digital era, anime was produced with traditional animation methods using a pose to pose approach.[34] The majority of mainstream anime uses fewer expressive key frames and more in-between animation.[40] 
Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aɲime] (listen)) is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan. 
In Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. 
However, outside of Japan and in English, anime is colloquial for Japanese animation and refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1] Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese animation is referred to as anime-influenced animation. 
Japanese animation studios were pioneers of many limited animation techniques, and have given anime a distinct set of conventions. 
Unlike Disney animation, where the emphasis is on the movement, anime emphasizes the art quality and let limited animation techniques make up for the lack of time spent on movement. 
Such techniques are often used not only to meet deadlines but also as artistic devices.[41] Anime scenes place emphasis on achieving three-dimensional views, and backgrounds are instrumental in creating the atmosphere of the work.[10] The backgrounds are not always invented and are occasionally based on real locations, as exemplified in Howl's Moving Castle and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.[42][43] Oppliger stated that anime is one of the rare mediums where putting together an all-star cast usually comes out looking "tremendously impressive".[44] 
The cinematic effects of anime differentiates itself from the stage plays found in American animation. 
Anime is cinematically shot as if by camera, including panning, zooming, distance and angle shots to more complex dynamic shots that would be difficult to produce in reality.[45][46][47] In anime, the animation is produced before the voice acting, contrary to American animation which does the voice acting first.[48] 
The body proportions of human anime characters tend to accurately reflect the proportions of the human body in reality. 
The height of the head is considered by the artist as the base unit of proportion. 
Head heights can vary, but most anime characters are about seven to eight heads tall.[49] Anime artists occasionally make deliberate modifications to body proportions to produce super deformed characters that feature a disproportionately small body compared to the head; many super deformed characters are two to four heads tall. 
Some anime works like Crayon Shin-chan completely disregard these proportions, in such a way that they resemble caricatured Western cartoons. 
A common anime character design convention is exaggerated eye size. 
The animation of characters with large eyes in anime can be traced back to Osamu Tezuka, who was deeply influenced by such early animation characters as Betty Boop, who was drawn with disproportionately large eyes.[50] Tezuka is a central figure in anime and manga history, whose iconic art style and character designs allowed for the entire range of human emotions to be depicted solely through the eyes.[51] The artist adds variable color shading to the eyes and particularly to the cornea to give them greater depth. 
Generally, a mixture of a light shade, the tone color, and a dark shade is used.[52][53] Cultural anthropologist Matt Thorn argues that Japanese animators and audiences do not perceive such stylized eyes as inherently more or less foreign.[54] However, not all anime characters have large eyes. 
For example, the works of Hayao Miyazaki are known for having realistically proportioned eyes, as well as realistic hair colors on their characters.[55] 
Hair in anime is often unnaturally lively and colorful or uniquely styled. 
The movement of hair in anime is exaggerated and "hair action" is used to emphasize the action and emotions of characters for added visual effect.[56] Poitras traces hairstyle color to cover illustrations on manga, where eye-catching artwork and colorful tones are attractive for children's manga.[56] Despite being produced for a domestic market, anime features characters whose race or nationality is not always defined, and this is often a deliberate decision, such as in the Pokémon animated series.[57] 
Anime and manga artists often draw from a common canon of iconic facial expression illustrations to denote particular moods and thoughts.[58] These techniques are often different in form than their counterparts in Western animation, and they include a fixed iconography that is used as shorthand for certain emotions and moods.[59] For example, a male character may develop a nosebleed when aroused.[59] A variety of visual symbols are employed, including sweat drops to depict nervousness, visible blushing for embarrassment, or glowing eyes for an intense glare.[60] Another recurring sight gag is the use of chibi (deformed, simplified character designs) figures to comedically punctuate emotions like confusion or embarrassment.[59] 
The opening and credits sequences of most anime television series are accompanied by J-pop or rock songs, often by reputed bands—as written with the series in mind—but are also aimed at the general music market, therefore it is often alluded once vaguely or not all to the thematic settings or plot of the series. 
Also, they are often used as incidental music ("insert songs") for each episode to highlight particularly important scenes.[61] 
The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917. 
A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience. 
Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. 
In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games. 
It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences. 
Anime are often classified by target demographic, including children's (子供, kodomo), girls' (少女, shōjo), boys' (少年, shōnen) and a diverse range of genres targeting an adult audience. 
Shoujo and shounen anime sometimes contain elements popular with children of both sexes in an attempt to gain crossover appeal. 
Adult anime may feature a slower pace or greater plot complexity that younger audiences may typically find unappealing, as well as adult themes and situations.[62] A subset of adult anime works featuring pornographic elements are labeled "R18" in Japan, and are internationally known as hentai (originating from pervert (変態, hentai)). 
By contrast, some anime subgenres incorporate ecchi, sexual themes or undertones without depictions of sexual intercourse, as typified in the comedic or harem genres; due to its popularity among adolescent and adult anime enthusiasts, the inclusion of such elements is considered a form of fan service.[63][64] Some genres explore homosexual romances, such as yaoi (male homosexuality) and yuri (female homosexuality). 
While often used in a pornographic context, the terms yaoi and yuri can also be used broadly in a wider context to describe or focus on the themes or the development of the relationships themselves.[65] 
Anime's genre classification differs from other types of animation and does not lend itself to simple classification.[66] Gilles Poitras compared the labeling Gundam 0080 and its complex depiction of war as a "giant robot" anime akin to simply labeling War and Peace a "war novel".[66] Science fiction is a major anime genre and includes important historical works like Tezuka's Astro Boy and Yokoyama's Tetsujin 28-go. 
A major subgenre of science fiction is mecha, with the Gundam metaseries being iconic.[67] The diverse fantasy genre includes works based on Asian and Western traditions and folklore; examples include the Japanese feudal fairytale InuYasha, and the depiction of Scandinavian goddesses who move to Japan to maintain a computer called Yggdrasil in Ah! 
My Goddess.[68] Genre crossing in anime is also prevalent, such as the blend of fantasy and comedy in Dragon Half, and the incorporation of slapstick humor in the crime anime film Castle of Cagliostro.[69] Other subgenres found in anime include magical girl, harem, sports, martial arts, literary adaptations, medievalism,[70] and war.[71] 
Early anime works were made for theatrical viewing, and required played musical components before sound and vocal components were added to the production. 
In 1958, Nippon Television aired Mogura no Abanchūru ("Mole's Adventure"), both the first televised and first color anime to debut.[72] It was not until the 1960s when the first televised series were broadcast and it has remained a popular medium since.[73] Works released in a direct to video format are called "original video animation" (OVA) or "original animation video" (OAV); and are typically not released theatrically or televised prior to home media release.[74][75] The emergence of the Internet has led some animators to distribute works online in a format called "original net anime" (ONA).[76] 
The home distribution of anime releases were popularized in the 1980s with the VHS and LaserDisc formats.[74] The VHS NTSC video format used in both Japan and the United States is credited as aiding the rising popularity of anime in the 1990s.[74] The LaserDisc and VHS formats were transcended by the DVD format which offered the unique advantages; including multiple subtitling and dubbing tracks on the same disc.[77] The DVD format also has its drawbacks in its usage of region coding; adopted by the industry to solve licensing, piracy and export problems and restricted region indicated on the DVD player.[77] The Video CD (VCD) format was popular in Hong Kong and Taiwan, but became only a minor format in the United States that was closely associated with bootleg copies.[77] 
Akihabara district of Tokyo is popular with anime and manga fans as well as otaku subculture in Japan 
The animation industry consists of more than 430 production companies with some of the major studios including Toei Animation, Gainax, Madhouse, Gonzo, Sunrise, Bones, TMS Entertainment, Nippon Animation, P.A.Works, Studio Pierrot and Studio Ghibli.[78] Many of the studios are organized into a trade association, The Association of Japanese Animations. 
There is also a labor union for workers in the industry, the Japanese Animation Creators Association. 
Studios will often work together to produce more complex and costly projects, as done with Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away.[78] An anime episode can cost between US$100,000 and US$300,000 to produce.[79] In 2001, animation accounted for 7% of the Japanese film market, above the 4.6% market share for live-action works.[78] The popularity and success of anime is seen through the profitability of the DVD market, contributing nearly 70% of total sales.[78] According to a 2016 article on Nikkei Asian Review, Japanese television stations have bought over ¥60 billion worth of anime from production companies "over the past few years", compared with under ¥20 billion from overseas.[80] There has been a rise in sales of shows to television stations in Japan, caused by late night anime with adults as the target demographic.[80] This type of anime is less popular outside Japan, being considered "more of a niche product".[80] Spirited Away (2001) is the all-time highest-grossing film in Japan.[81][82] It was also the highest-grossing anime film worldwide until it was overtaken by Makoto Shinkai's 2016 film Your Name.[83] Anime films represent a large part of the highest-grossing Japanese films yearly in Japan, with 6 out of the top 10 in 2014, in 2015 and also in 2016. 
Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. 
It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques.[2] Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots.[2] Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.[3] 
Anime has to be licensed by companies in other countries in order to be legally released. 
While anime has been licensed by its Japanese owners for use outside Japan since at least the 1960s, the practice became well-established in the United States in the late 1970s to early 1980s, when such TV series as Gatchaman and Captain Harlock were licensed from their Japanese parent companies for distribution in the US market. 
The trend towards American distribution of anime continued into the 1980s with the licensing of titles such as Voltron and the 'creation' of new series such as Robotech through use of source material from several original series.[84] 
In the early 1990s, several companies began to experiment with the licensing of less children-oriented material. 
Some, such as A.D. Vision, and Central Park Media and its imprints, achieved fairly substantial commercial success and went on to become major players in the now very lucrative American anime market. 
Others, such as AnimEigo, achieved limited success. 
Many companies created directly by Japanese parent companies did not do as well, most releasing only one or two titles before completing their American operations. 
Licenses are expensive, often hundreds of thousands of dollars for one series and tens of thousands for one movie.[85] The prices vary widely; for example, Jinki: Extend cost only $91,000 to license while Kurau Phantom Memory cost $960,000.[85] Simulcast Internet streaming rights can be cheaper, with prices around $1,000-$2,000 an episode,[86] but can also be more expensive, with some series costing more than US$200,000 per episode.[87] 
The anime market for the United States was worth approximately $2.74 billion in 2009.[88] Dubbed animation began airing in the United States in 2000 on networks like The WB and Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.[89] In 2005, this resulted in five of the top ten anime titles having previously aired on Cartoon Network.[89] As a part of localization, some editing of cultural references may occur to better follow the references of the non-Japanese culture.[90] The cost of English localization averages US$10,000 per episode.[91] 
The industry has been subject to both praise and condemnation for fansubs, the addition of unlicensed and unauthorized subtitled translations of anime series or films.[92] Fansubs, which were originally distributed on VHS bootlegged cassettes in the 1980s, have been freely available and disseminated online since the 1990s.[92] Since this practice raises concerns for copyright and piracy issues, fansubbers tend to adhere to an unwritten moral code to destroy or no longer distribute an anime once an official translated or subtitled version becomes licensed. 
They also try to encourage viewers to buy an official copy of the release once it comes out in English, although fansubs typically continue to circulate through file-sharing networks.[93] Even so, the laid back regulations of the Japanese animation industry tend to overlook these issues, allowing it to grow underground and thus increasing the popularity until there is a demand for official high-quality releases for animation companies. 
This has led to an increase in global popularity with Japanese animations, reaching $40 million in sales in 2004.[94] 
Legal international availability of anime on the Internet has changed in recent years, with simulcasts of series available on websites like Crunchyroll. 
However, such services are still mostly limited to the Western, English-speaking countries, resulting in many fans in the developing world turning to online piracy.[1] 
Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) valued the domestic anime market in Japan at ¥2.4 trillion ($24 billion), including ¥2 trillion from licensed products, in 2005.[96] JETRO reported sales of overseas anime exports in 2004 to be ¥2 trillion ($18 billion).[97] JETRO valued the anime market in the United States at ¥520 billion ($5.2 billion),[96] including $500 million in home video sales and over $4 billion from licensed products, in 2005.[98] JETRO projected in 2005 that the worldwide anime market, including sales of licensed products, would grow to ¥10 trillion ($100 billion).[96][98] The anime market in China was valued at $21 billion in 2017,[99] and is projected to reach $31 billion by 2020.[100] Netflix reported that, between October 2019 and September 2020, more than 100 million member households worldwide had watched at least one anime title on the platform.[101] 
The anime industry has several annual awards that honor the year's best works. 
Major annual awards in Japan include the Ōfuji Noburō Award, the Mainichi Film Award for Best Animation Film, the Animation Kobe Awards, the Japan Media Arts Festival animation awards, the Tokyo Anime Award and the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year. 
In the United States, anime films compete in the Crunchyroll Anime Awards. 
There were also the American Anime Awards, which were designed to recognize excellence in anime titles nominated by the industry, and were held only once in 2006.[102] Anime productions have also been nominated and won awards not exclusively for anime, like the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature or the Golden Bear. 
The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies, including major studios like Studio Ghibli, Sunrise, and Toei Animation. 
Since the 1980s, the medium has also seen international success with the rise of foreign dubbed and subtitled programming. 
As of 2016, Japanese anime accounted for 60% of the world's animated television shows.[4] 
Anime has become commercially profitable in Western countries, as demonstrated by early commercially successful Western adaptations of anime, such as Astro Boy and Speed Racer. 
Early American adaptions in the 1960s made Japan expand into the continental European market, first with productions aimed at European and Japanese children, such as Heidi, Vicky the Viking and Barbapapa, which aired in various countries. 
Italy, Spain, and France grew a particular interest into Japan's output, due to its cheap selling price and productive output. 
In fact, Italy imported the most anime outside of Japan.[103] These mass imports influenced anime popularity in South American, Arabic, and German markets.[104] 
The beginning of 1980 saw the introduction of Japanese anime series into the American culture. 
In the 1990s, Japanese animation slowly gained popularity in America. 
Media companies such as Viz and Mixx began publishing and releasing animation into the American market.[105] The 1988 film Akira is largely credited with popularizing anime in the Western world during the early 1990s, before anime was further popularized by television shows such as Pokémon and Dragon Ball Z in the late 1990s.[106][107] The growth of the Internet later provided international audiences an easy way to access Japanese content.[4] Early on, online piracy played a major role in this, through over time legal alternatives appeared. 
This is especially the case with net services such as Netflix and Crunchyroll which have large catalogs in Western countries, although as of 2020 anime fans in many non-Western countries, such as India or Southeast Asia, have difficulty obtaining access to legal content, and therefore still turn to online piracy.[108][109][95][110] 
As a type of animation, anime is an art form that comprises many genres found in other mediums; it is sometimes mistakenly classified as a genre itself.[5] In Japanese, the term anime is used to refer to all animated works, regardless of style or origin.[6] English-language dictionaries typically define anime (US: /ˈænəmeɪ/, UK: /ˈænɪmeɪ/)[7] as "a style of Japanese animation"[8] or as "a style of animation originating in Japan".[9] Other definitions are based on origin, making production in Japan a requisite for a work to be considered "anime".[5] 
The etymology of the term anime is disputed. 
The English word "animation" is written in Japanese katakana as アニメーション (animēshon) and as アニメ (anime, pronounced [a.ɲi.me] (listen)) in its shortened form.[1] Some sources claim that the term is derived from the French term for animation dessin animé ("cartoon", literally 'animated design'),[10] but others believe this to be a myth derived from the popularity of anime in France in the late 1970s and 1980s.[1]

Zwide may refer to: 
Langa kaXaba (? – circa 1805) was the King of the Ndwandwe nation. 
In the Zulu language, "Langa" means "sun" or "day" and "kaXaba" means "son of Xaba". He was the father and predecessor of King Zwide kaLanga, the rival to King Shaka kaSenzangakhona. 
The Ndwandwe are a Bantu Nguni-speaking people who populate sections of southern Africa. 
In 1819, Zwide made another expedition against the Zulus, but Shaka again changed his tactics, letting the Ndwandwe army penetrate his territory and responding with guerrilla warfare. 
Shortage of supplies caused the Ndandwe to return home, but when they were crossing the river Mhlatuze in early 1820, their forces were split and defeated at the Battle of Mhlatuze River. 
This led to the disintegration of the Ndwandwe nation as Zwide's generals and sons led sections of the Ndwandwe northwards. One such group, under Soshangane, formed the Gaza Empire in present-day central Mozambique while another, under Zwangendaba, established rule as the waNgoni in present-day Malawi. 
Others established themselves as chiefs of note in Swaziland and Zambia to create a Ndwandwe legacy of enduring power that is scattered across Southern Africa.

Discography 
Umgungundlovu may refer to: 
uMgungundlovu, king Dingane's 19th century royal kraal in northern KwaZulu-Natal Umgungundlovu District Municipality, a district in southern KwaZulu-Natal 
The main entrance (isango) was on the northern, or lower, side of the slope against which the complex lay. This entrance was divided into two sections to control incoming and outgoing traffic. Narrow entrances at several places in the palisade controlled access to the ikhanda. 
Inside the arena were smaller cattle enclosures; these were built bordering the inside palisade of the hut circle, and contained the herds. 
From the main entrance, which served as a dividing line between the eastern and western sections (uhlangothi), the huts of the warriors stretched round the circle of the royal area (isigodlo). On the eastern side were huts occupied by four selected regiments under the leadership of the chief (induna) Ndlela. On the western side were those under the command of the induna Dambuza. 
The royal enclosure (isigodlo) was situated behind a palisade fence on the southern, or higher, side of the oval-shaped complex, directly opposite the main entrance. 
The king, his mistresses and female attendants (Dingane never married officially), a total of at least 500 people, resided here.[1] The women were divided into two groups, namely the black isigodlo and the white isigodlo. 
The black isigodlo comprised about 100 privileged women, and within that group another elite called the bheje, a smaller number of girls, favoured by the king as his mistresses. 
A small settlement was built for them behind the main complex where they could enjoy some privacy. 
The remainder of the king's women were called the white isigodlo. These consisted mainly of girls presented to the king by his important subjects. 
He also selected other girls at the annual first fruit ceremony (umkhosi). 
A large half-moon shaped area was included in the black isigodlo; here the women and the king sang and danced. The huts in the black isigodlo were divided into compartments of about three huts each, enclosed by a two-metre-high hedge of intertwined withes, which created a network of passages.[1] 
The king's private hut (ilawu) was located in one such triangular compartment and had three or four entrances.[2] His hut was very large and was kept very neat by attendants; it could easily accommodate 50 people. 
Modern archaeological excavations have revealed that the floor of this large hut was approximately 10 metres in diameter. 
Archaeologists found evidence inside the hut of 22 large supporting posts completely covered in glass beads.[3] These had been noted in historical accounts by Piet Retief, leader of the Voortrekkers, and the British missionary Owen and American missionary Champion. 
On the south side, just behind the main complex, were three separate enclosed groups of huts. The centre group was used by the uBheje women of the black isigodlo. 
In this area, they initiated chosen young girls into the service of the king. 
KwaMatiwane, or Execution hill, is the ridge northeast of uMgungundlovu. It is so named after chief Matiwane who, around 1829/30, was executed here with his followers after they had gone against Dingane's rule. Reverend Francis Owen resided a short distance from the hill during the 1830s and remarked that the vultures circling over the bodies of those newly slain were a regular sight.[1] 
Monument at the execution hill, commemorating the Retief delegation that was massacred here by Dingane 28°25′37″S 31°16′12″E﻿ / ﻿28.42694°S 31.27000°E﻿ / -28.42694; 31.27000 
On 6 February 1838, Execution hill became the place where Dingane directed the killing of the Voortrekker Piet Retief and his entourage. The British missionary and his staff had warned Retief that he was in danger from Dingane, but the chief had won the trekkers' trust and they did not listen. Dingane had them killed after agreeing to a large cession of land (which he may not have fully understood, as the document was in English). 
uMgungundlovu was the royal capital of the Zulu King Dingane (1828–1840) and one of several military complexes (amakhanda) which he maintained. He established his royal kraal in 1829 in the eMakhosini valley against Lion hill (Singonyama), just south of the White Umfolozi River. 
The name uMgungundlovu stems from the Zulu word or phrase ungungu we ndlovu, which means "the secret conclave of the elephant". 
Some sources also refer to uMgungundlovu as "the place of the elephant". The word indlovu (elephant) refers to the king of the Zulu people. 
The oval-shaped ikhanda (military settlement) contained between 1,400 and 1,700 huts, which could house between 5,000 and 7,000 residents. This number varied as regiments were called up at different times. 
The huts stood six to eight deep and formed a huge ring around an open area, known as the large cattle kraal (isibaya esikulu). This space was also utilised for military parades and gatherings. The circle of huts was enclosed both inside and out by a strong defensive palisade. 
The Zulus were originally a close-knit ethnic group community that had migrated to the eastern plateau of present-day South Africa; they became a strong tribal nation largely due to the efforts of an ambitious chieftain named Shaka (c. 
1787–1828, reigned 1816–1828). 
A rebellious young man, Shaka was estranged from his father, who was a Zulu chief named Senzangakhona, and became a warrior with the Mthethwa people. The Mthethwa paramount chieftain Dingiswayo helped Shaka become recognized as head of the Zulus after Senzangakhona died in 1816. The two chieftains were close friends, and their warriors fought together against common enemies, such as the Ndwandwe headed by King Zwide. 
After Dingiswayo was captured and executed by Zwide, the Mthethwa people placed themselves under Shaka and took the Zulu name. Shaka revolutionized traditional ways of fighting by introducing the iklwa, a short stabbing spear, as a weapon and by organizing warriors into disciplined units that fought in close formation behind large cowhide shields. In the Battle of Gqokli Hill in 1817, his troops and tactics prevailed over the superior numbers of the Ndwandwe people, who failed to destroy the Zulus in their first encounter. 
The Ndwandwe and the Zulus met again in combat at the Battle of Mhlatuze River in 1819. 
By this time the Ndwandwe had adopted Zulu battle tactics and weapons so Shaka wore the invaders down with guerrilla tactics before launching his major attack when the Ndwandwe army was divided during the crossing of the Mhlatuze River.[1] Zulu warriors arrived at Zwide's headquarters near present-day Nongoma before news of the defeat, and approached the camp singing Ndwandwe victory songs to gain entry. 
Zwide himself escaped with a handful of followers, and most of the Ndwandwe abandoned their lands and migrated north establishing Zulu-like (named Ngoni after the ethno-linguistic name "Nguni") kingdoms in Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania. This was the final phase of the Mfecane, a catastrophic, bloody civil war and eventual migration of many different tribes in the area, initially (ca. 1802) caused by famine but ultimately as a result of escaping from the Zulus.[2] The Ngoni groups caused their own havoc by using Zulu tactics in war. 
They established stronger political units in other countries and thus posed a threat to European colonisation, for example during the Maji-Maji Rebellion in German East Africa (1905–1907).[3] Shaka was the ultimate victor, and his people still live today throughout Zululand, with customs and a way of life that can be easily traced to Shaka's day. 
His compositions consist principally of settings of Zulu texts. 
His Five African Songs is an arrangement of four traditional songs and one modern tune for choir and symphony orchestra. It has been recorded by the South African National Symphony Orchestra and Chamber Choir of the South African Broadcasting Corporation, conducted by Richard Cock.[4] Two of the five songs are in the Xhosa language, and the other three are in Zulu. The piece has also been orchestrated by Peter Louis Van Dijk.[5] 
In 1986 he composed a choral work for the enthronement of Archbishop Desmond Tutu.[6] Khumalo is also the composer of the cantata uShaka KaSenzangakhona, which tells the story of the Zulu king, Shaka.[7] 
On 22 June 2021, Mzilikazi Khumalo died two days after his 89th birthday following a long illness.[16][17][18] 
James Steven Mzilikazi Khumalo (20 June 1932 —22 June 2021) was a South African composer and professor emeritus of African languages at the University of the Witwatersrand. 
Khumalo was born on the farm KwaNgwelu in Natal in 1932. Shortly after Khumalo's birth his parents were ordained as ministers in the Salvation Army, which ran the farm at the time.[1] The family moved to Hlabisa, where Khumalo started school. 
After completing high school Khumalo enrolled at the teachers' training college in Mamelodi. He continued his studies, obtaining a bachelor's degree with majors in English and Zulu in 1956 from the University of South Africa. He went on to obtain master's degree and, in 1988, a PhD, both from the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.[2] 
Khumalo's career in the Department of African Languages of the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg began in 1969, when he held a position as a tutor. 
He advanced to become a professor of African languages and head of the Department of African Languages at Wits. 
His first composition was Ma Ngificwa Ukufa, which had its premiere in 1959.[3]

In Norse mythology, Iðunn is a goddess associated with apples and youth. Iðunn is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, she is described as the wife of the skaldic god Bragi, and in the Prose Edda, also as a keeper of apples and granter of eternal youthfulness. 
Iðunn is introduced as Bragi's wife in the prose introduction to the poem Lokasenna, where the two attend a feast held by Ægir. In stanzas 16, 17, and 18, dialog occurs between Loki and Iðunn after Loki has insulted Bragi. In stanza 16, Iðunn (here anglicized as Idunn) says: 
In the poem Hrafnagaldr Óðins, additional information is given about Iðunn, though this information is otherwise unattested. 
Here, Iðunn is identified as descending from elves, as one of "Ivaldi's elder children" and as a dís who dwells in dales. Stanza 6 reads: 
The name Iðunn has been variously explained as meaning "ever young", "rejuvenator", or "the rejuvenating one".[1] As the modern English alphabet lacks the eth (ð) character, Iðunn is sometimes anglicized as Idun, Idunn or Ithun.[2] An -a suffix is sometimes applied to denote femininity, resulting in forms such as Iduna and Idunna.[3]

On 1 January 1981, it changed its name to TV1, with the launch of two new services: TV2 broadcasting in Zulu and Xhosa and TV3 broadcasting in Sotho and Tswana, both targeted at a Black urban audience.[2] The main channel, now called TV1, was divided evenly between English and Afrikaans, as before. 
In 1986, a new service called TV4 was introduced, carrying sports and entertainment programming, using the channel shared by TV2 and TV3, which stopped broadcasting at 9:30pm.[3] 
After the SABC restructured its television channels, SABC 2 took the place of the old TV1 channel.

At 37 acres (150,000 m2), the Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus in Chennai, India, is the largest bus station in Asia.[3] 
The Woodlands Temporary Bus Interchange in Singapore is also one of the busiest bus interchanges in the world, handling 400,000 passengers daily[4] across 42 bus services.[5] Bedok and Tampines Bus Interchanges in the city-state handle similar number of passengers daily. 
The largest underground bus station in Europe is Kamppi Centre of Helsinki, Finland completed in 2006. 
The terminal cost 100 million Euro to complete and took 3 years to design and build. Today, the bus terminal, which covers 25,000 square meters, is the busiest bus terminal in Finland. 
Every day, the terminal has around 700 bus departures, transporting some 170,000 passengers.[6] 
Preston Bus Station in Preston, Lancashire, built in 1969 and later heritage-listed, was described in 2014 as "depending on how you measure it, the largest bus station in the world, the second-biggest in Europe, and the longest in Europe".[7] It was fully refurbished in 2018.[8] 
The largest bus terminal in Greece is the Macedonia Bus Terminal located outside of the city centre of Thessaloniki. This bus terminal connects all major cities and every part of Greece, including some islands as well as some international destinations to neighbouring countries. 
(Millennium Park Bus Depot in Delhi is the largest bus depot in the world, but it does not function as a bus station.) 
While the term bus depot can also be used to refer to a bus station, it generally refers to a bus garage. A bus station is larger than a bus stop, which is usually simply a place on the roadside, where buses can stop. It may be intended as a terminal station for a number of routes, or as a transfer station where the routes continue. 
Bus station platforms may be assigned to fixed bus lines, or variable in combination with a dynamic passenger information system.[1] The latter requires fewer platforms, but does not supply the passenger the comfort of knowing the platform well in advance and waiting there. 
An accessible station is a public transportation passenger station which provides ready access, is usable and does not have physical barriers that prohibit and/or restrict access by people with disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs.[2] 
Most stations are located underground, with entrances/exits leading up to ground or street level. 
The bulk of the station is typically positioned under land reserved for public thoroughfares or parks. Placing the station underground reduces the outside area occupied by the station, allowing vehicles and pedestrians to continue using the ground-level area in a similar way as before the station's construction. This is especially important where the station is serving high-density urban precincts, where ground-level spaces are already heavily utilised.[1] 
At street level the logo of the metro company marks the entrances/exits of the station. Usually, signage shows the name of the station and describes the facilities of the station and the system it serves. Often there are several entrances for one station, saving pedestrians from needing to cross a street and reducing crowding.[1] 
A metro station typically provides ticket vending and ticket validating systems. The station is divided into an unpaid zone connected to the street, and a paid zone connected to the train platforms. The ticket barrier allows passengers with valid tickets to pass between these zones. 
The barrier may operated by staff or more typically with automated turnstiles or gates that open when a transit pass is scanned or detected.[4] Some small metro systems dispense with paid zones and validate tickets with staff in the train carriages.[5] 
Transfer stations 
Some metro stations are interchanges, serving to transfer passengers between lines or transport systems. 
The platforms may be multi-level. Transfer stations handle more passengers than regular stations, with additional connecting tunnels and larger concourses to reduce walking times and manage crowd flows. 
The shallow column station is a type of construction of subway stations, with the distinguishing feature being an abundance of supplementary supports for the underground cavity.[9] Most designs employ metal columns or concrete and steel columns arranged in lines parallel to the long axis of the station. 
A deep column station is a type of subway station consisting of a central hall with two side halls connected by ring-like passages between a row of columns.[10] Depending on the type of station, the rings transmit load to the columns either by "wedged arches" or through purlins, forming a "column-purlin complex". 
The pylon station is a type of deep underground subway station.[11] The basic distinguishing characteristic of the pylon station is the manner of division of the central hall from the station tunnels 
The construction of a single-vault station consists of a single wide and high underground hall, in which there is only one vault (hence the name).[12] The first single-vault stations in the USSR were built in Leningrad in 1975: Politekhnicheskaya and Ploshchad Muzhestva. Also in Saint Petersburg was built the first and so far the only two-level single-vault transfer station in Russia: Sportivnaya. 
A metro station or subway station is a railway station for a rapid transit system, which as a whole is usually called a "metro" or "subway". A station provides a means for passengers to purchase tickets, board trains, and evacuate the system in the case of an emergency. In the United Kingdom, they are known as underground stations, most commonly used in reference to the London Underground. 
The location of a metro station is carefully planned to provide easy access to important urban facilities such as roads, commercial centres, major buildings and other transport nodes. 
A charging station, also called an EV charger or electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), is a piece of equipment that supplies electrical power for charging plug-in electric vehicles (including hybrids, neighborhood electric vehicles, trucks, buses, and others). 
Although batteries can only be charged with DC power, most electric vehicles have an onboard AC-to-DC converters that allows them to be plugged into a standard household AC electrical receptacle. Inexpensive low-power public charging stations will also provide AC power, known as "AC charging stations". 
To facilitate higher power charging, which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters, the converter is built into the charging station instead of the vehicle, and the station supplies already-converted DC power directly to the vehicle, bypassing the vehicle's onboard converter. 
These are known as "DC charging stations". Most fully electric car models can accept both AC and DC power. 
The first filling station was the city pharmacy in Wiesloch, Germany, where Bertha Benz refilled the tank of the first automobile on its maiden trip from Mannheim to Pforzheim back in 1888. Shortly thereafter other pharmacies sold gasoline as a side business. Since 2008 the Bertha Benz Memorial Route commemorates this event.[12][13] 
North America 
Filling stations with premium brands sell well-recognized and often international brands of fuel, including Exxon and its Esso brand, Phillips 66/Conoco/76, Chevron, Mobil, Shell, Husky Energy, Sunoco (US), BP, Valero and Texaco. Non-international premium brands include Petrobras, Petro-Canada (owned by Suncor Energy Canada), QuikTrip, Hess, Sinclair, and Pemex. Premium-brand stations accept credit cards, often issue their own company cards (fuel cards or fleet cards) and may charge higher prices. 
A filling station is a facility that sells fuel and engine lubricants for motor vehicles. 
The most common fuels sold in the 2010s were gasoline (or "petrol") and diesel fuel. 
A fire station (also called a fire house, fire hall, firemen's hall, or engine house) is a structure or other area for storing firefighting apparatus such as fire engines and related vehicles, personal protective equipment, fire hoses and other specialized equipment. Fire stations frequently contain working and living space for the firefighters and support staff. 
In large US cities, fire stations are often named for the primary fire companies and apparatus housed there, such as "Ladder 49". Other fire stations are named based on the district, neighborhood, town or village where they are located, or given a number. 
A fire station will at a minimum have a garage for housing at least one fire engine. There will also be storage space for equipment, though the most important equipment is stored in the vehicle itself. The approaches to a fire station are often posted with warning signs, and there may be a traffic signal to stop or warn traffic when apparatus are leaving or returning to the station. 
Fire stations have often been built with a tower, for purposes that have changed with time. A drill tower is used for practicing high-rise rescue, while a hose tower is used for hanging hoses to dry to prevent rot.[1] Historically, towers were lookouts for spotting fires.[1] 
Activities at a fire station include regular inspection and cleaning of the apparatus and equipment, and training drills in which the firefighters practice their skills. Some fire companies also host public activities at the fire station during events such as a "fire prevention week", and the facility may also be used for fund-raising by the "firemen's association", "fire buffs", or "fire auxiliary". 
Office space where officers, detectives and administrative staff can work Cells for detainees. 
In the UK, the area with cells is known as a custody suite Interview rooms for both detainees and non-detained visitors Evidence rooms for storing evidence and seized property Lockers and storerooms for storing equipment A reception desk for public visitors Car park for fleet vehicles and officer-owned personal vehicles A room for personnel from other emergency services 
Specialized stations exist in a number of countries, typically containing more or less of these facilities. An example includes women's police stations in Latin America. 
Large departments may have many stations to cover the area they serve. The names used for these facilities include: 
The area a police station serves has a variety of different names, such as precinct, district, division and zone. However, in some police forces such as Hampshire Constabulary, police stations do not serve a specific area and the officers have great flexibility over where they can operate. 
Mumbuni High School (also known as Mumbuni Secondary School) is a school in Kenya which is located 3 kilometres (1.9 miles) from Machakos town. It is one of the largest schools in Machakos County with over 800 students. 
Daniel "Churchill" Ndambuki, two former members of the Kenyan parliament, Mutinda Mutiso and Daudi Mwanzia.[1][2] Mercy K. Wambua Chief Executive Officer of the Law Society of Kenya, Noor Ahmed Mohamed African Statesman 2030 are among its alumni. 
The school had "A" level classes during the former education system. The last A-level class sat for exams in 1989. 
The school used to be a mixed school but on February 7, 2005, the girls moved across the road to their own school, Mumbuni Girls High School. 
Tongai Moyo (12 March 1968 – 15 October 2011) was a contemporary Zimbabwean musician, often referred to as Dhewa. Born and raised in Kwekwe, Dhewa rose to fame in the late 1990s as a solo artist and with the band Utakataka Express.[1] Highly successful singles including "Samanyemba", "Naye", and "Muchina Muhombe" led to his national, regional and international fame; he produced 14 albums in a career of over twenty years.[2] 
Tongai Moyo succumbed to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at St Anne's Hospital on the evening of Saturday 15 October 2011 in Harare. Close to 15,000 people came to pay their last respects to him at Mbizo Stadium in Kwekwe.[5] He was buried in Zhombe his rural home.[6] 
His 14th and final album, Toita Basa, was released on 25 November 2010 by record label Gramma Records.[3] The album was released while he was being treated for cancer, which had been diagnosed in 2008. 
The song "Ndinobvuma" was especially dedicated to his fight against the disease.[4] 
Moyo was born on the 12th of March in 1968 in Kwekwe. He died on 15 October 2011. He was married to Miniehle Mukweli and had six children namely Natasha, Nicole, Obert (Tongai Jnr), Tanaka and Nyasha and Peter Moyo. 
The talented musician started his career in 1988 in his home-town Kwekwe. To honor his craft, the 'Muchinamuhombe' singer, played in numerous bands and eventually joined Shirichena Jazz Band as a session musician, and helped the band to release two albums and a single. The most popular was "Ndoita Zvangu Ndega" which was released in 1991 Moyo was virtually known by then. 
He went on to create his own band the Utakataka Express after which he released his first solo album, 'Vimbo' in 1996. The album earned Moyo a name in the music industry, which was dominated by the likes of Nicholas Zakaria and Alick Macheso who sang the same genre. Since then, he never looked back and went on to release 14 albums to his credit. 
The album "Naye" saw Dhewa hogging the limelight with his chart topper "Nemumvura Mese" which earned him two Zimbabwe Music Awards (ZIMA). At the time of his death, Moyo had just released his 14th album 'Toita Basa'. 
Lillian Dube (born 30 September 1945)[1] is a South African actress.[2][3][4][5] She is perhaps best known for portraying Masebobe in the soap opera Generations.[6] 
In 2007, Dube was diagnosed with breast cancer and has been in remission as of 2008.[7][8] The cancer returned again in 2015.[9][10] 
In 2017, Dube was awarded an honorary doctorate in Drama and Film Production at the Tshwane University of Technology.[11]

In physics, energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to a body or physical system to perform work on the body, or to heat it. Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. 
The unit of measurement in the International System of Units (SI) of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a distance of one metre against a force of one newton.

Inkosi, otherwise appearing as Nkosi, is the Zulu and Xhosa for chieftain in Southern Africa. Inkosikazi is the equivalent term for a chieftess. 
An inkosi that has authority over several subordinate inkosis is traditionally referred to as an Inkosi Enkhulu (lit. 
"Great Chieftain"). This version of the title is typically translated as king in English. 
Albert Lutuli Mandla Mandela George Matanzima Kaiser Matanzima Qaqambile Matanzima Falo Mgudlwa Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
Zwelivelile "Mandla" Mandela, MP (born 21 June 1974)[1] is the tribal chief of the Mvezo Traditional Council and the grandson of icon Nelson Mandela.[2][3] He graduated from Rhodes University with a degree in Politics in 2007.[4] 
His father, Makgatho Mandela, died in 2005, which paved his way to the headship of the clan. As the tribe did not discuss electing a member from the Mandela family until 2007, he was chosen as successor. 
Nelson Mandela had given up the right of Thembu leader nearly 70 years prior to fight white rule in South Africa. As the tribe now looked to him to reclaim his title, he suggested his grandson assume the role. When the younger Mandela became chief in 2007, he was only 32 years old and most of his duties were said to involve tribal ceremonies, settling disputes among clan members, and representing the tribe on political issues. 
Mandela has been a member of parliament for the African National Congress since the 2009 election.[5] 
Khaya is a genus of five tree species in the mahogany family Meliaceae. The timber of Khaya is called African mahogany, and is valued as a substitute to American mahogany (of the genus Swietenia).[1] 
The genus is native to tropical Africa and Madagascar. All species grow to around 30–35m tall, rarely 45m, with a trunk over 1m diameter, often buttressed at the base. 
The leaves are pinnate, with 4-6 pairs of leaflets, the terminal leaflet absent; each leaflet is 10–15 cm long abruptly rounded toward the apex but often with an acuminate tip. The leaves can be either deciduous or evergreen depending on the species. The flowers are produced in loose inflorescences, each flower small, with four or five yellowish petals and ten stamens. 
The fruit is a globose four or five-valved capsule 5–8 cm diameter, containing numerous winged seeds. 
Species 
The Venus of Brassempouy 
Among the Fulani people of west Africa, unmarried women wear their hair ornamented with small amber beads and coins, while married women wear large amber ornaments. Marriage is signified among the Toposa women of South Sudan by wearing the hair in many small pigtails. Unmarried Hopi women have traditionally worn a "butterfly" hairstyle characterized by a twist or whorl of hair at each side of the face.[39] Hindu widows in India used to shave their heads as part of their mourning, although this practice has mostly disappeared now. 
In many cultures, including Hindu culture and among the Wayana people of the Guiana highlands, young people have historically shaved off their hair to denote coming-of-age. Women in India historically have signified adulthood by switching from wearing two braids to one. Among the Rendille of north-eastern Kenya and the Tchikrin people of the Brazilian rainforest, both men and women shave their heads after the death of a close family member. 
When a man died in ancient Greece, his wife cut off her hair and buried it with him,[1] and in Hindu families, the chief mourner is expected to shave his or her head 3 days after the death.[40] 
Upper-class people have always used their hairstyles to signal wealth and status. Wealthy Roman women wore complex hairstyles that needed the labours of several people to maintain them,[41] and rich people have also often chosen hairstyles that restricted or burdened their movement, making it obvious that they did not need to work.[42] Wealthy people's hairstyles used to be at the cutting edge of fashion, setting the styles for the less wealthy. 
But today, the wealthy are generally observed to wear their hair in conservative styles that date back decades prior.[43] 
Middle-class hairstyles tend to be understated and professional. Middle-class people aspire to have their hair look healthy and natural, implying that they have the resources to live a healthy lifestyle and take good care of themselves. 
Working-class men have often shaved their heads or worn their hair close-cropped, and working-class women have typically pulled their hair up and off their faces in simple styles. However, today, working-class people often have more elaborate and fashion-conscious hairstyles than other social classes. Many working-class Mexican men in American cities wear their hair in styles like the Mongolian (shaved except for a tuft of hair at the nape of the neck) or the rat tail (crewcut on top, tuft at the nape), and African-Americans often wear their hair in complex patterns of box braids and cornrows, fastened with barrettes and beads, and sometimes including shaved sections or bright colour. 
The oldest known reproduction of hair braiding lies back about 30,000 years: the Venus of Willendorf, now known in academia as the Woman of Willendorf, of a female figurine from the Paleolithic, estimated to have been made between about 28,000 and 25,000 BCE.[6] The Venus of Brassempouy counts about 25,000 years old and indisputably shows hairstyling. 
In the Bronze Age, razors were known and in use by some men, but not on a daily basis since the procedure was rather unpleasant and required resharpening of the tool which reduced its endurance.[7] 
A hairstyle, hairdo, or haircut refers to the styling of hair, usually on the human scalp. 
Sometimes, this could also mean an editing of facial or body hair. The fashioning of hair can be considered an aspect of personal grooming, fashion, and cosmetics, although practical, cultural, and popular considerations also influence some hairstyles.[1] 
A hairstyle is achieved by arranging hair in a certain way, occasionally using combs, a blow-dryer, gel, or other products. The practice of styling hair is often called hairdressing, especially when done as an occupation. 
Hair dressing may include cuts, weaves, coloring, extensions, perms, permanent relaxers, curling, and any other form of styling or texturing. 
Hair cutting or hair trimming is intended to create or maintain a specific shape and form. There are ways to trim one's own hair but usually another person is enlisted to perform the process, as it is difficult to maintain symmetry while cutting hair at the back of one's head. 
Cutting hair is often done with hair clipper, scissors, and razors. 
Combs and hair grips are often employed to isolate a section of hair which is then trimmed. 
Hair dryers speed the drying process of hair by blowing air, which is usually heated, over the wet hair shaft to accelerate the rate of water evaporation. 
Prehistory and history 
Throughout times, people have worn their hair in a wide variety of styles, largely determined by the fashions of the culture they live in. Hairstyles are markers and signifiers of social class, age, marital status, racial identification, political beliefs, and attitudes about gender. 
Wigs 
Some people may cover their hair totally or partially for cultural or religious reasons. 
Notable examples of head covering include women in Islam who wear the hijab, married women in Haredi Judaism who wear the sheitel or tichel, married Himba men who cover their hair except when in mourning, Tuareg men who wear a veil, and baptized men and women in Sikhism who wear the dastar.[3][4][5] 
Synthetic wigs are usually made from a fine fiber that mimics human hair. 
This fiber can be made in almost any color and hairstyle, and is often glossier than human hair. However, this fiber is sensitive to heat and cannot be styled with flat irons or curling irons. There is a newer synthetic fiber that can take heat up to a certain temperature. 
Human hair wigs can be styled with heat, and they must be brushed only when dry. Synthetic and human hair wigs should be brushed dry before shampooing to remove tangles. 
To clean the wig, the wig should be dipped into a container with water and mild shampoo, then dipped in clear water and moved up and down to remove excess water. The wig must then be air dried naturally into its own hairstyle. Proper maintenance can make a human hair wig last for many years. 
Hairpins, clasps, barrettes, headbands, ribbons, rubber bands, scrunchies, and combs can be used to achieve a variety of styles. There are also many decorative ornaments that, while they may have clasps to affix them to the hair, are used solely for appearance and do not aid in keeping the hair in place. In India for example, the Gajra (flower garland) is common there are heaps on hairstyles. 
At most times in most cultures, men have worn their hair in styles that are different from women's. American sociologist Rose Weitz once wrote that the most widespread cultural rule about hair is that women's hair must differ from men's hair.[35] An exception is the men and women living in the Orinoco-Amazon Basin, where traditionally both genders have worn their hair cut into a bowl shape. 
In Western countries in the 1960s, both young men and young women wore their hair long and natural, and since then it has become more common for men to grow their hair.[36] During most periods in human history when men and women wore similar hairstyles, as in the 1920s and 1960s, it has generated significant social concern and approbation.[37]

On 1 March 2016, Kebe provided an out-of-competition urine sample, which tested positively for prohibited substance stanozolol, and was officially charged with an anti-doping violation on 2 August 2017. He pleaded guilty, claiming that former team-mate Monde Hadebe gave him a supplement that contained the substance, and received a two-year ban with effect from 7 July 2016.[11] Kebe launched an appeal against the decision, in which the appeals panel ruled that his ban should be changed from two years to four years, with Kebe allowed to return to rugby on 8 July 2020.[12] 
Ntando Lucky Kebe (born 19 August 1988) is a South African rugby union player, who most recently played domestic Currie Cup rugby with the Border Bulldogs and Super Rugby with the Southern Kings.[1] His regular position is scrum-half. 
World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., d/b/a WWE, is an American integrated media and entertainment company[6][7] that is primarily known for professional wrestling. WWE has also branched out into other fields, including movies, football, and various other business ventures. 
The WWE name also refers to the professional wrestling promotion itself, which was founded in 1953 as the Capitol Wrestling Corporation. 
It is the largest wrestling promotion in the world, holding over 450 live events a year, with the roster primarily divided up into three globally traveling brands, and is available to 900 million homes worldwide in 28 languages. The company's global headquarters is located in Stamford, Connecticut, with offices in New York, Los Angeles, London, Mexico City, Mumbai, Shanghai, Singapore, Dubai, Munich and Tokyo. 
WWE Raw, also known as Monday Night Raw or simply Raw, is an American professional wrestling television program produced by WWE that currently airs live every Monday at 8pm ET on the USA Network in the United States. The show features characters from the Raw brand, to which WWE employees are assigned to work and perform. The show debuted on January 11, 1993 and is currently considered to be one of two flagship shows, along with Friday Night SmackDown.[1] In September 2000, Raw moved from the USA Network to TNN,[2] which rebranded to Spike TV in August 2003. 
Since April 20, 2021, the official theme song for NXT is "Say Cheese" by Poppy, first performed at NXT TakeOver: Stand & Deliver. 
In its original incarnation, the American Bang song "Wild and Young" had been used for each season with the exception of the third.[55] During season three, the show's opening theme song was "You Make the Rain Fall" by Kevin Rudolf.[56][57] "Vices and Virtues" by Art of Dying was also used as bumper music during the initial five seasons of the show.[58] 
In June 2012, WWE ended the seasonal competition format and opted to revamp the show. WWE NXT became the flagship television show of the NXT brand, and has since received a positive reception and high viewership, with praise for its high quality of wrestling[1][2] and captivating storylines. Many consider NXT to be superior to WWE's flagship shows.[3][4] 
The initial version of the show made its debut on Syfy on February 23, 2010, replacing ECW, but was replaced by SmackDown in October. It then aired as an hourly webcast on WWE.com on the United States until June 13, 2012, before it was expanded to international markets on the WWE Network in 2014. In 2019, NXT expanded into a live two-hour program on the USA Network. 
On February 2, 2010, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon announced that a new weekly program would replace the canceled ECW in its time slot on Syfy. McMahon described the show as "the next evolution of WWE; the next evolution of television history".[5] 
WWE SmackDown, also known as Friday Night SmackDown or simply SmackDown, is an American professional wrestling television program produced by WWE that currently airs live every Friday at 8pm ET on Fox. 
Fox Deportes simulcasts the program with Spanish-language commentary. 
The show features characters from the SmackDown brand, to which WWE employees are assigned to work and perform. The show is currently considered to be one of two flagship shows, along with Monday Night Raw.[4] 
Broadcast 
In addition to the Spanish-language Fox Deportes simulcasting with Fox live in the United States and broadcasts to American troops deployed overseas on AFN Sports 2,[1][69] SmackDown also appears on-air internationally. 
SmackDown airs live on Fox Sports in Mexico[70][71] and across Central and South America since 2014.[70][72][73][74] 
The program has historically aired sometimes in simulcast with the U.S. airing and sometimes a day before. In 2005, when the taped show moved to Friday airings in the U.S., it remained on Thursdays in Canada for a period of time. During its return to Thursdays in the U.S. from January 2015 to July 2016, pre-recorded episodes of SmackDown aired on Wednesdays—one night earlier—due to conflicts with the channel's Thursday-night National Hockey League broadcasts.[75] 
The program has aired in simulcast with the U.S. broadcast since it switched to a live format in July 2016, initially on Tuesdays and then moving back to Fridays in October 2019. Despite the move to Fox (which is widely carried on Canadian television providers), Rogers has not elected to simulcast SmackDown on its broadcast network Citytv to invoke potential simsub rights. 
SmackDown airs live in Australia on Saturday late mornings/early afternoons and Sunday afternoons on Fox8 and Friday nights on 9Go! as a one-hour version,[76][77] and airs live in New Zealand on Sky 5 and Sunday nights on Prime as a one-hour version.[78]

Broadcast history 
Khayamiya (Egyptian Arabic: خيّامية‎ khayyāmiyah) is a type of decorative appliqué textile historically used to decorate tents across the Middle East. They are now primarily made in Cairo, Egypt, along what is known as the Street of the Tentmakers (Shari'a al-Khayamiyya, or Suq al-Khayamiyya) centered in the Qasaba of Radwan Bey, a historic covered market built in the 17th century. The street is located immediately south of Bab Zuweila, and is located along the historic economic axis of Cairo (the section north of Bab Zuweila is known today as al-Mu'izz street). 
Historic specimens of khayamiya are rare. They were originally made to be placed outside in dry heat and dust, and were regarded as replaceable – hence not highly valued for collection or preservation. 
Khedival examples are held in the collection of several museums, including the British Museum.[3] There are also references to khayamiya in photographic records and European orientalist paintings from the nineteenth century and earlier. Literary references to their use, including illustrations, can be seen in medieval manuscripts.[4] There is archaeological evidence to suggest that textiles comparable to khayamiya have been created and used in Egypt since the Pharaonic era.[3] 
Despite their historic legacy, the tentmaker occupation is now endangered.[1][5] This is largely due to competition from imported mass-printed fabrics bearing similar decorative patterns. These printed sheets are now widely used across Egypt as temporary screens for special events, notably during Ramadan, festivals, weddings, and funerals, in place of the original handmade khayamiya. 
The majority of khayamiya created in recent years are marketed to tourists visiting Egypt. In the 2000s, the first international exhibitions of Egyptian khayamiya were held in Australia, the UK, France, and the USA. These were curated by Jenny Bowker, an Australian quiltmaker and teacher.[6][7] 
The Egyptian artist Moataz Nasr features khayamiya-inspired aspects in his contemporary mixed-media artwork.[8] Susan Hefuna's installation "I Love Egypt!" (featured in the 18th Biennale of Sydney in 2012) also applies Khayamiya within the context of contemporary installation art.[9] From 2009, the Egyptian artist Hani el-Masri collaborated with the Tentmakers to produce a 5 m × 8 m (16 ft × 26 ft) interpretation of the One Thousand and One Nights.[10] The Algerian artist Rachid Koraïchi has also collaborated with the Tentmakers of Cairo to create large calligraphic banners, such as his Invisible Masters series. As Koraïchi stated in 2011: 
"When we talk about an Islamic craft tradition, we're not talking about the art of the 19th century that took place in an artist's studio and on canvas. 
Here we're talking about things that come out of everyday life... 
It's not a world in which the artist lives apart." 
The culture of the artisan – still present, but steadily disappearing in the streets of Koraichi's native Algeria and surrounding Maghreb countries – offers an insight into how art can be drawn directly from a day-to-day world, yet heightened by the dedication of craft. "If you look at the foundations of western art," Koraichi continued, "it was based on a whole tradition of craft that went into churches; the goblets made by metalworkers and the marbling. It's exactly the same with mosques, in that they were built by those who could work with stone and weaving. 
These are sources that we can clearly see but the question we have is how to take those disappearing traditions and make them present again in the living moment."[11] 
This link will direct you to a Google Map detailing the location of the Street of the Tentmakers, relative to the popular tourist landmarks of the Khan el-Khalili. The Tentmaker's Street is not known for the hard-sell hassles associated with touristic shopping in the Khan el-Khalili.[12] 
Khedival khayamiya were made between 1867 and 1914. 
These are usually large appliqued panels in indigo, red, and white on beige canvas, often featuring vertical blue stripes in the canvas itself. 
Touristic khayamiya were made from the 1890s through to the present day, and were notably popular after the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922. 
These are often smaller, and are figurative appliques, usually featuring motifs from ancient Egypt or what were then contemporary scenes of Egyptian life, especially folkloric scenes. 
They were generally purchased by international travelers to Egypt as popular Egyptian souvenirs. 
Street khayamiya include panels made for outdoor use within Egypt, such as suradeq pavilions or backdrops for public events. 
These are large scale "architectural" textiles. 
In the 20th century the average size of a panel was 2.75 by 5.57 metres (9.0 by 18.3 ft). Many panels were tied together on a wooden structure to form a fabric pavilion. 
Contemporary khayamiya are appliqué panels made for indoor use. 
Khayamiya are elaborately patterned and colourful appliqués applied to the interior of tents, serving a dual function of shelter and ornament. They resemble quilts, and possess the three layers typical of quilts – a heavy "back", a background "top", and elaborate appliqué over the "top". Functionally, they can be compared to curtains, though their recent roles have diversified to cater for touristic purposes. 
These can range from basic cushion covers to intricate whole-wall hangings several metres across. Large projects can subsequently take several months to complete. The tentmakers are very protective of their creative innovations, as successful new designs are often copied by their competitive neighbours. 
Egyptian folkloric subjects such as Goha, Nubian musicians, and the whirling dervishes are popular touristic souvenirs, as are stylised depictions of fish and birds. Calligraphic patterns, based upon texts from the Qur'an, are often shaped into objects and animals. Khedival panels made in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century typically feature larger blocks of appliqué and wider stitching, though touristic and contemporary khayamiya feature finer and more elaborate handwork. 
The correct spelling is in Arabic, but English approximations of this term are diverse, including khiamiah, khiyamiya, khiamiyya, khyamiyya, kheyyemiah, kheyameya, and khayyāmia. 
The Arabic word khayma (خيمة), meaning "tent", is linked to the Persian khayyām (خیام), which means "tentmaker". 
Popular alternative descriptions in English include the "work of the Tentmakers of Cairo", "tentmaker appliqué" or simply "Egyptian appliqué". Medhat Adel Emam has discussed the origin of the term as it applies to distinctly Egyptian Arabic with Turkish influences.[1] Very large decorated khayamiya "pavilions" are known as suradeq.[2] 
Early 2007, she and Mina Ahadi were amongst the founders of the Central Council of Ex-Muslims, a German association that aims to represent people who have renounced Islam.[1] Toker opines that Islam is inhumane, contrary to the German Constitution and both misogynous and misandrous: according to her, women in Islam are being "degraded to breeding machines". She warns that in many Dutch cities there are women's and day care centres in the hands of Islamists.[2] By allowing this Islamic pillarisation, the Netherlands are too tolerant in Toker's view. For her, Islam stands for oppression, and one should be allowed to say that, naming Ayaan Hirsi Ali as their example.[3]

Geybullayeva has received numerous threats in various social media circles stemming from Azerbaijan over her cooperation with the Istanbul-based Armenian newspaper Agos.[1][14][15] In an interview with Global Voices, she stated she was branded a "traitor" and that the blackmail escalated into death threats towards her and her family.[4][5] The threats have caused her to refrain from visiting her native Azerbaijan then in a self-imposed exile in Turkey in 2015.[15] 
Arzu Geybullayeva (Azerbaijani: Arzu Qeybullayeva), also known as Arzu Geybulla (Azerbaijani: Arzu Qeybulla), is an Azerbaijani columnist, blogger, and journalist for several newspapers and media news outlets including Al Jazeera, Foreign Policy, Global Voices, and Agos.

She advocates a peaceful resolution among Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. However, in recent years, she has received various threats mainly stemming from Azerbaijan due to her work with Agos, an Armenian newspaper. The threats were internationally condemned by various human rights organizations. 
While in Istanbul in 2007, Geybullayeva began working for the European Stability Initiative, a non-profit research and policy institute and a think-tank for South East Europe.[6] In September 2008, she started her blog called Flying Carpets and Broken Pipelines.[2] Since 2009, she has become a contributing columnist to editorials for Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso, a think-tank based in Italy.[6]

In 1991, TV2, TV3 and TV4 were combined into a new service called CCV (Contemporary Community Values). A third channel was introduced known as TSS, or TopSport Surplus, TopSport being the brand name for the SABC's sport coverage, but this was replaced by NNTV (National Network TV), an educational, non-commercial channel, in 1993. 
Established in 1996, SABC Education is an SABC business unit responsible for delivering the educational mandate of the public broadcaster. In true South African social tradition, SABC Education meets this challenge by delivering compelling educational content for diverse audiences in South Africa and the rest of Africa. SABC Education’s content, gathered from a wide range of educational issues contributes to a rich cultural shared South African identity. 
Enriching Minds, Enriching Lives![1] 
In 2015, SABC Education partnered up with Tuluntulu to launch the brand as an online channel alongside SABC Children.[3] 
In 2018, the SABC downsized it's unfunded DTT plans to 9 channels with SABC Sport and Education present in that portfolio.[4] They also launched a virtual academy for the brand to assist matriculants with their studies and equip them with the necessary skills to work independently. 
In 2020, there was a pandemic which forced schools to shut down so the public broadcaster decided to rollout the channel on DTT and YouTube from May 4th with more platforms scheduled to add it soon.[5] In October of that year, the SABC partnered up with Telkom to distribute the channel alongside SABC's other properties through a new streaming service, TelkomOne.[6]

eToonz is a South African digital satellite television free-to-air children's channel created and owned by eMedia Investments's e.tv.[1]The channel broadcasts for a duration of 16 hours from Sunday to Friday, 17 hours on Saturday and 18 hours with movies during the school holidays. 
e.tv as a broadcaster launched eKasi+,eToonz+, eMovies+ and eAfrica+ as new sister channels as the first of its planned set of TV channels for digital terrestrial television (DTT). e.tv, the SABC and M-Net plan to each roll out their own collections of additional TV channels in South Africa eventually. 
News and Sports is a South African free-to-air digital satellite television news and sports channel created and owned by e.tv's eMedia Investments.[1] Previously named OpenNews, it is the second news channel created by eMedia, ironically being the rival of its sister channel eNCA.[2] 
eMedia launched OpenNews as a response to Openview viewers high demand for a local news channel. Although eMedia already owns a 24-hour eNCA, the channel is exclusively produced for DStv and BBC World News (which is on both platforms) did not satisfy the viewers' needs for local news. 
The channel was launched at 17:00 CAT and used to broadcast local news from 17:00 CAT to 23:00 CAT Monday to Friday. 
The broadcasting time was later reserved and now shows local news from 16:00 CAT until 19:30 CAT with the rest of the hours meant for international news partners such as TRT World, China Global Television Network, France 24 and some local documentaries. 
Later that year, the channel started showing Sports and used the e.tv Sport logo before becoming News & Sport. 
Thereafter the channel was also made available on Viu. 
The News Service was established in June 1950, replacing the programmes of the BBC. Although this was because the BBC broadcasts were seen as giving a British viewpoint of current affairs, there were also concerns that the SABC service would become overly pro-government, or "Our Master's Voice". 
By 1968, it had over 100 full-time reporters in the main cities and local correspondents all over the country, with overseas news provided by Reuters, AFP, AP and UPI. 
There was a News Film Unit which, prior to television in 1976, produced films for news agencies and television organisations. 
In March 2021, eMedia Investments, owners of free-to-air satellite service Openview, and the SABC have reached a business agreement that sees Openview continue to broadcast high-definition channels SABC 1, 2 and 3, as well as 3 additional television channels with one being SABC Sport from the public broadcaster, as well as all 19 radio stations owned by the SABC. SABC Sport alongside their radio stations were made available on Openview from April 17th.[3][4] 
The channel features old and new matches some of which are already available on SABC 1-3. 
Notable programs on the channel include Sport Arena, Sport @10 and Soccerzone.SABC SPORT licences ESPN content in South Africa such as ESPN FC and EFL Championship

A third channel was introduced known as TSS, or TopSport Surplus, TopSport being the brand name for the SABC's sport coverage, but this was replaced by NNTV (National Network TV), an educational, non-commercial channel, in 1993. 
In 2012, The SABC planned to invest R732.7 million over the next two years to set up SABC Sport as a separate TV channel in South Africa on October 1. They also signed a multimillion rand deal with America's NBA to show full coverage on SABC Sport and selected matches to SABC 1 to prevent viewing disruption before missing the deadline.[1] 
Mzansi Community Satellite, trading as GauTV sought the licence from ICASA to provide satellite-based television to Gauteng viewers. It says the authority's decision to keep not to grant it a licence was unfair and not keeping with the relevant legislation.[1] 
In 2014, Alex TV (also known as LX TV) a rival station catering to the northern part of Johannesburg launched on Openview in April offering informative and educational entertainment as well as current affairs.[2] 
In 2015, after running for a year Alex TV closed down in the same month it launched. In October of that year, GauTV finally got its own channel through MultiChoice's DStv platform broadcasting from 06:00 - 18:00 (12 hours a day) where most of the population aren't available during that time.[3] 
By March 2017, the channel increased its broadcasting hours from 12 hours to 24 hours.[4] 
Cape Town TV is a community television channel that broadcasts in Cape Town, South Africa. It launched in September 2008 with a one-year, "temporary" license and thereafter won another such license in September 2009. 
It is a non-profit organisation that is licensed as a community broadcaster in terms of South Africa's Electronic Communications Act. 
Programmes are mainly of a documentary nature, covering topics such as NGOs, health, spirituality, religion, human rights, democracy, environment and world affairs. The channel has made a name for itself by broadcasting programmes that would never be shown on conventional television stations. These include controversial issues such as 'conspiracy theories' (e.g. Illuminati, the 9-11 attacks, etc.), animal rights/anti-cruelty, UFOs, the Mayan Calendar and socialism. 
CTV, like other community television stations in South Africa, faces a number of challenges. These include funding, availability of broadcast frequencies and the migration from analogue to digital broadcasting. 
CTV is a free-to-air channel that broadcasts on an analogue transmission. 
The channel transmits from a single low-power transmitter located on Tygerberg hill, to the north of Cape Town. This site provides the widest possible coverage of the Cape Town metropolitan region, although it is only licensed (by ICASA) for low-power transmission. The channel is broadcast on the frequency 607.25 MHz (channel 38) on the UHF band.[1] 
On September 2017, the channel launched their first sister channel, Onse TV. The new channel has entertainment that caters for the Coloured community.[2]

Its launch also coincided with the launch of the virtual social network vuzu.tv in an effort to make the channel far more interactive than its predecessor. The first program to broadcast was the popular show known as Touch TV, which aired at 16:00 (previously 17:00 ). Many Go viewers protested the launch of the channel as it caused a number of go's programs to move to new time slots, channels or disappear completely. 
In 2012, the channel once more went through a change as its traditional channel number 123 changed to 116. In 2014, a companion channel was created in replacement of M-Net Series Showcase which later was rebranded as Vuzu Amp.

In 1986 pay-television came to South Africa when an analogue, single-channel service, M-Net, was launched by Naspers. For almost seven years, all of M-Net's operations were handled by a single company until 1993 when a second subsidiary company, Multichoice, was created by Naspers. The decoder sales, subscriber services, account management and other business related matters were handled by Multichoice.[2]

Although Middle English spelling used ⟨e⟩ to represent long and short /e/, the Great Vowel Shift changed long /eː/ (as in 'me' or 'bee') to /iː/ while short /ɛ/ (as in 'met' or 'bed') remained a mid vowel. 
In other cases, the letter is silent, generally at the end of words like queue. 
E, or e, is the fifth letter and the second vowel letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet. 
Its name in English is e (pronounced /ˈiː/), plural ees.[1] It is the most commonly used letter in many languages, including Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Hungarian, Latin, Latvian, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish.[2][3][4][5][6]

Africa Media Online is an organisation that enables African media professionals to reach international markets. Based in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, the organisation provides online media library systems, professional digitisation services, digital imaging training, and access to a worldwide audience through their image library, previously known as africanpictures.net. 
The image library represents individual African photographers, including the likes of the internationally acclaimed Guy Tillim, Greg Marinovich and David Goldblatt, as well as acts as an aggregator of content by representing other photographic and heritage agencies such as South Photographs, Baileys African History Archive and Shuter & Shooter Publishers. Until late 2008 all stock photography was sold on a Rights Managed basis. 
Now the organisation has launched a series of Royalty Free collections in which all images are model-released and available for multiple usages, including advertising, for a single fee. 
Africa Media Online (Pty) Ltd. is a black owned company, defined by the South African Department of Trade and Industry as an HDI, and is a Level 3 Black Economic Empowerment Contributor. The organisation also owns Digitise Africa, a high-end digitisation service geared at putting African photographic collections online. 
The company has established a not-for-profit trust, the independent Digitise Africa Trust, in order to raise funds for training African professionals and digitising African collections. 
The African Image Pipeline (AIP) project was made possible with 70% grant funding from the European Union through Gijima KwaZulu-Natal,[1][2] launches EU funded African Image Pipeline project an initiative of South Africa's Department of Economic Development. 
The African Image Pipeline enables the organisation to train photographers from historically disadvantaged backgrounds; digitise 32 000 images from photographers and the heritage sector; upgrade the MEMAT online media library system; translate the African Archival Thesaurus, which allows images to be searched, into the major trade languages of Africa; and gain greater penetration into global media markets. 
Bi Community News (commonly shortened to BCN) is the United Kingdom's only magazine serving the bisexual population. It is published bimonthly and includes many articles reflecting bisexual life and media representation as well as news from the bisexual community. 
This is a regular column since 2015, highlighting new research on bisexuality, and exploring the bi data within general and LGBT research. The title was the draft working name for the 2012 Bisexuality Report, which brought together research on bisexuality in the UK. 
Each edition lists national and local bi or bi-relevant organisations in the UK and Ireland. There is also a section on popular resources on research and advice, and upcoming bisexual community events dates. 
In 2001 BCN published "An A-Z of Bi Group Running",[2] a resource for helping build local community support. It was written by Jen Yockney based on five years of organising Manchester-based bisexual community group BiPhoria and BiCon workshops about bi group organising. 
In 2007 BCN published "Both Directions",[3] a 20-page guide to the UK bisexual scene and its history, as well as bi books, films and other resources. Further editions were published each year until 2011 when BiPhoria published "Getting Bi In A Gay / Straight World". 
BCN's website recommended that over their own Both Directions title as more accessible. 
Resulting from a workshop at the UK BiCon in 1995, it started as a zine moving to being a full-colour glossy magazine around 2010. It has been consistently published since October 1995.[1] The current editor is Jen Yockney MBE. 
BCN was shortlisted for Community Group or Organisation of the Year in the 2011 Homo Hero Awards, alongside Outdoor Lads and the Albert Kennedy Trust.[4] 
Because of its community newsletter roots the magazine has strong links with the grassroots bisexual community. It acts as postal box address for local bi groups without their own secure mail facilities, maintains the Bi Local Groups Network, and hosted several UK Bi Activist Weekends bringing together volunteers running bisexual community organisations around the UK. 
Vulvar cancer is a cancer of the vulva, the outer portion of the female genitals.[1] It most commonly affects the labia majora.[1] Less often, the labia minora, clitoris, or vaginal glands.[1] Symptoms include a lump, itchiness, changes in the skin, or bleeding from the vulva.[1] 
Risk factors include vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), HPV infection, genital warts, smoking, and many sexual partners.[1][3] Most vulvar cancers are squamous cell cancers.[4] Other types include adenocarcinoma, melanoma, sarcoma, and basal cell carcinoma.[3] Diagnosis is suspected based on physical examination and confirmed by tissue biopsy.[1] Routine screening is not recommended.[3] 
Depending on the cellular origin, different histologic cancer subtypes may arise in vulvar structures.[22][23] 
Surgery is a mainstay of therapy depending on anatomical staging and is usually reserved for cancers that have not spread beyond the vulva.[1] Surgery may involve a wide local excision (excision of the tumor with a safety-margin of healthy tissue, that ensures complete removal of the tumor), radical partial vulvectomy, or radical complete vulvectomy with removal of vulvar tissue, inguinal and femoral lymph nodes.[2][3] In cases of early vulvar cancer, the surgery may be less extensive and consist of wide excision or a simple vulvectomy. 
Surgery is significantly more extensive when the cancer has spread to nearby organs such as the urethra, vagina, or rectum. Complications of surgery include wound infection, sexual dysfunction, edema and thrombosis, as well as lymphedema secondary to dissected lymph nodes.[33] 
Vulvar cancer newly affected about 44,200 people and resulted in 15,200 deaths globally in 2018.[1] 
Vulvar cancer can be split up into two types. One starts as an infection by human papillomavirus, which leads to vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and potentially on to vulvar cancer.[40] This is most common in younger women, predominantly under the age of 40.[40] The second type is vulvar non-neoplastic epithelial disorders (VNED). 
This is most common in older women, due to the increased risk for developing cellular atypia which in turn leads to cancer.[40] 
United States 
In the United States, it newly occurred in about 6,070 people with 1,280 deaths a year.[1] It makes up about 0.3% of new cancer cases,[2] and 5% of gynecologic cancers in the United States.[43] Vulvar cancer cases have been rising in the United States at an increase of .6% each year for the past ten years.[3] 
Itching, burn, or bleeding on the vulva that does not go away. 
Changes in the color of the skin of the vulva, so that it looks redder or whiter than is normal. 
Skin changes in the vulva, including what looks like a rash or warts. 
Sores, lumps, or ulcers on the vulva that do not go away. 
Pain in the pelvis, especially during urination or sex.[7] 
Thabo Patrick Sefolosha (/ˈtɑːboʊ ˌsɛfəˈloʊʃə/; born May 2, 1984) is a Swiss former professional basketball player who last played for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Potassium is a chemical element with the symbol K (from Neo-Latin kalium) and atomic number 19. 
Potassium is a silvery-white metal that is soft enough to be cut with a knife with little force.[5] Potassium metal reacts rapidly with atmospheric oxygen to form flaky white potassium peroxide in only seconds of exposure. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. 
In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals, all of which have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, that is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge – a cation, that combines with anions to form salts. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. 
Elemental potassium reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction, and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight[6][7]), and occurs in many minerals such as orthoclase, a common constituent of granites and other igneous rocks.[8] 
Yahya John Mandlakayise Hlophe (born 1 January 1959 in Stanger, KwaZulu-Natal) is Judge President of the Western Cape Division of the High Court of South Africa. 
Return to work 
Hlophe returned to work in 2009, saying he had returned because he had been "out too long" and was tired of living off taxpayers' money. The settlement talks had "stalled" and the stalemate was preventing him from "reaching his best potential in the profession".[41] 
In September 2009, Hlophe received permission from the Justice Ministry to return to work.[43] 
Born in Stanger, KwaZulu-Natal, he was educated at the University of Natal; the University of Fort Hare and Cambridge University. 
Hlophe taught law at the University of Transkei, South Africa, before being appointed in 1995, aged 36, to sit as the first black judge in the High Court in Cape Town. He was the first full-time academic to be appointed as a High Court Judge.[2] He was appointed to head the court in 2000. 
Munteanu is a Romanian language surname (Romanian pronunciation: [munˈte̯anu]). 
When transliterated from Russian, in may be spelled as Muntyanu. 
It is commonly found in Romania and Moldova and literally translates as "highlander". 
Notable people with this surname include: 
Finding Freemasonry expensive, and not open to his ideas, he founded his own society which was to have a system of ranks or grades based on those in Freemasonry, but with his own agenda.[1] His original name for the new order was Bund der Perfektibilisten, or Covenant of Perfectibility (Perfectibilists); he later changed it because it sounded too strange.[7] On 1 May 1776, Weishaupt and four students formed the Perfectibilists, taking the Owl of Minerva as their symbol.[8][9] The members were to use aliases within the society. 
Weishaupt became Spartacus. Law students Massenhausen, Bauhof, Merz and Sutor became respectively Ajax, Agathon, Tiberius and Erasmus Roterodamus. 
Weishaupt later expelled Sutor for indolence.[5][11] In April 1778, the order became the Illuminatenorden, or Order of Illuminati, after Weishaupt had seriously contemplated the name Bee order.[12] 
With the departure of Massenhausen, Zwack immediately applied himself to recruiting more mature and important recruits. Most prized by Weishaupt was Hertel, a childhood friend and a canon of the Munich Frauenkirche. By the end of summer 1778 the order had 27 members (still counting Massenhausen) in 5 commands; Munich (Athens), Ingolstadt (Eleusis), Ravensberg (Sparta), Freysingen (Thebes), and Eichstaedt (Erzurum).[1] 
Knigge was recruited late in 1780 at a convention of the Rite of Strict Observance by Costanzo Marchese di Costanzo, an infantry captain in the Bavarian army and a fellow Freemason. Knigge, still in his twenties, had already reached the highest initiatory grades of his order, and had arrived with his own grand plans for its reform. Disappointed that his scheme found no support, Knigge was immediately intrigued when Costanzo informed him that the order that he sought to create already existed. 
Knigge and three of his friends expressed a strong interest in learning more of this order, and Costanzo showed them material relating to the Minerval grade. The teaching material for the grade was "liberal" literature which was banned in Bavaria, but common knowledge in the Protestant German states. Knigge's three companions became disillusioned and had no more to do with Costanzo, but Knigge's persistence was rewarded in November 1780 by a letter from Weishaupt. 
Knigge, for his own part, was flattered by the attention, and drawn towards the order's stated aims of education and the protection of mankind from despotism. Weishaupt managed to acknowledge, and pledge to support, Knigge's interest in alchemy and the "higher sciences". Knigge replied to Weishaupt outlining his plans for the reform of Freemasonry as the Strict Observance began to question its own origins.[16] 
Weishaupt set Knigge the task of recruiting before he could be admitted to the higher grades of the order. 
Knigge accepted, on the condition that he be allowed to choose his own recruiting grounds. Many other masons found Knigge's description of the new masonic order attractive, and were enrolled in the Minerval grade of the Illuminati. Knigge appeared at this time to believe in the "Most Serene Superiors" which Weishaupt claimed to serve. 
His inability to articulate anything about the higher degrees of the order became increasingly embarrassing, but in delaying any help, Weishaupt gave him an extra task. Provided with material by Weishaupt, Knigge now produced pamphlets outlining the activities of the outlawed Jesuits, purporting to show how they continued to thrive and recruit, especially in Bavaria. 
Meanwhile, Knigge's inability to give his recruits any satisfactory response to questions regarding the higher grades was making his position untenable, and he wrote to Weishaupt to this effect. 
In January 1781, faced with the prospect of losing Knigge and his masonic recruits, Weishaupt finally confessed that his superiors and the supposed antiquity of the order were fictions, and the higher degrees had yet to be written.[1] 
If Knigge had expected to learn the promised deep secrets of Freemasonry in the higher degrees of the Illuminati, he was surprisingly calm about Weishaupt's revelation. Weishaupt promised Knigge a free hand in the creation of the higher degrees, and also promised to send him his own notes. For his own part, Knigge welcomed the opportunity to use the order as a vehicle for his own ideas. 
His new approach would, he claimed, make the Illuminati more attractive to prospective members in the Protestant kingdoms of Germany. In November 1781 the Areopagus advanced Knigge 50 florins to travel to Bavaria, which he did via Swabia and Franconia, meeting and enjoying the hospitality of other Illuminati on his journey.[17] 
The order had now developed profound internal divisions. The Eichstaedt command had formed an autonomous province in July 1780, and a rift was growing between Weishaupt and the Areopagus, who found him stubborn, dictatorial, and inconsistent. Knigge fitted readily into the role of peacemaker.[1] 
Costanza wrote to the Royal York pointing out the discrepancy between the fees dispatched to their new Grand Lodge and the service they had received in return. The Royal York, unwilling to lose the revenue, offered to confer the "higher" secrets of Freemasonry on a representative that their Munich brethren would dispatch to Berlin. Costanza accordingly set off for Prussia on 4 April 1780, with instructions to negotiate a reduction in Theodore's fees while he was there. 
On the way, he managed to have an argument with a Frenchman on the subject of a lady with whom they were sharing a carriage. The Frenchman sent a message ahead to the king, some time before they reached Berlin, denouncing Costanza as a spy. He was only freed from prison with the help of the Grand Master of Royal York, and was expelled from Prussia having accomplished nothing.[1] 
The Illuminati[1] (plural of Latin illuminatus, 'enlightened') is a name given to several groups, both real and fictitious. 
Historically, the name usually refers to the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on 1 May 1776 in Bavaria, today part of Germany. The society's goals were to oppose superstition, obscurantism, religious influence over public life, and abuses of state power. "The order of the day," they wrote in their general statutes, "is to put an end to the machinations of the purveyors of injustice, to control them without dominating them."[2] The Illuminati—along with Freemasonry and other secret societies—were outlawed through edict by Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria, with the encouragement of the Catholic Church, in 1784, 1785, 1787, and 1790.[3] During subsequent years, the group was generally vilified by conservative and religious critics who claimed that the Illuminati continued underground and were responsible for the French Revolution. 
Knigge's initial plan to obtain a constitution from London would, they realised, have been seen through by the chapter. Until such time as they could take over other masonic lodges that their chapter could not control, they were for the moment content to rewrite the three degrees for the lodges which they administered.[1] 
Class I – The nursery, consisting of the Noviciate, the Minerval, and Illuminatus minor. 
Class II – The Masonic grades. 
The three "blue lodge" grades of Apprentice, Companion, and Master were separated from the higher "Scottish" grades of Scottish Novice and Scottish Knight. 
Class III – The Mysteries. The lesser mysteries were the grades of Priest and Prince, followed by the greater mysteries in the grades of Mage and King. 
It is unlikely that the rituals for the greater mysteries were ever written.[1][18] 
Delayed from 15 October 1781, the last convention of the Strict Observance finally opened on 16 July 1782 in the spa town of Wilhelmsbad on the outskirts of (now part of) Hanau. Ostensibly a discussion of the future of the order, the 35 delegates knew that the Strict Observance in its current form was doomed, and that the Convent of Wilhelmsbad would be a struggle over the pieces between the German mystics, under Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and their host Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel, and the Martinists, under Jean-Baptiste Willermoz. The only dissenting voices to mystical higher grades were Johann Joachim Christoph Bode, who was horrified by Martinism, but whose proposed alternatives were as yet unformed, and Franz Dietrich von Ditfurth, a judge from Wetzlar and master of the Joseph of the Three Helmets lodge there, who was already a member of the Illuminati. 
Ditfurth publicly campaigned for a return to the basic three degrees of Freemasonry, which was the least likely outcome of the convention. The mystics already had coherent plans to replace the higher degrees.[1] 
Many influential intellectuals and progressive politicians counted themselves as members, including Ferdinand of Brunswick and the diplomat Franz Xaver von Zach, who was the Order's second-in-command.[4] It attracted literary men such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Johann Gottfried Herder and the reigning Duke of Gotha and of Weimar.[5] 
The Illuminati did not survive their suppression in Bavaria. 
Their further mischief and plottings in the work of Barruel and Robison must be thus considered as the invention of the writers.[1] Despite this, they have been featured in many modern conspiracy theories predicated on their survival. 
Conspiracy theorists and writers such as Mark Dice have argued that the Illuminati have survived to this day.[32] 
Many conspiracy theories propose that world events are being controlled and manipulated by a secret society calling itself the Illuminati.[33] Conspiracy theorists have claimed that many notable people were or are members of the Illuminati. 
Presidents of the United States are a common target for such claims.[34][35] 
Other theorists contend that a variety of historical events were orchestrated by the Illuminati, from the French Revolution, the Battle of Waterloo and the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, to an alleged communist plot to hasten the "New World Order" by infiltrating the Hollywood film industry.[36][37] 
Adam Weishaupt (1748–1830) became professor of Canon Law and practical philosophy at the University of Ingolstadt in 1773. He was the only non-clerical professor at an institution run by Jesuits, whose order Pope Clement XIV had dissolved in 1773. 
The Jesuits of Ingolstadt, however, still retained the purse strings and some power at the university, which they continued to regard as their own. They made constant attempts to frustrate and discredit non-clerical staff, especially when course material contained anything they regarded as liberal or Protestant. Weishaupt became deeply anti-clerical, resolving to spread the ideals of the Enlightenment (Aufklärung) through some sort of secret society of like-minded individuals.[6] 
The competition has existed since 1921. Since 1987, the Ligue Nationale de Basket has governed the league. The bottom two placed teams from each season are relegated to the second tier level Pro B. The winner of the play-offs of the Pro A is crowned the French national champion.

All 16 Pro A League teams play each other twice during the regular season. At the end of the regular season, the top eight teams qualify for the playoffs. The two teams with the worst regular season records are relegated to the 2nd-tier Pro B. 
Through the 1985–86 season, the league championship was determined by a one-off final, or solely by league play. Since then, the format for the league finals has changed many times:[2] 
MILF (/mɪlf/, as if read as "milf") is an acronym that stands for "Mother I'd Like to Fuck".[1][2][3] This abbreviation is used in colloquial English, instead of the whole phrase. 
It connotes a sexually attractive older woman, typically one who has children.[1][2][4][5] The phrase's usage has gone from relatively obscure to mainstream in the media and entertainment.[when?] A related term is cougar, which suggests an older woman in active pursuit of younger men. 
Linguist Laurel A. Sutton states that MILF was one of 9 terms for "attractive women" collected from undergraduates at a large linguistics class at Berkeley in the spring of 1992. Stereotypical users would be "college students from East Contra Costa, California".[6] The term was widely popularized by the film American Pie (1999), where John Cho's character (simply credited as 'MILF Guy No. 2') used the term to refer to Jennifer Coolidge's character Jeanine Stifler.[7][8] 
A 2007 article in New York magazine stated the evidence that the term had become mainstream included "25,000-plus MILF-branded mugs and tees on Café Press to a rash of hot-mama books (The Hot Mom's Handbook, Confessions of a Naughty Mommy, The MILF Anthology), television shows (Desperate Housewives, The Real Housewives of Orange County, the forthcoming[according to whom?] contest Hottest Mom in America, and a pilot in development called MILF & Cookies), and, of course, a concomitant porn genre".[9] 
The term yummy mummy is also used along with MILF. The Oxford English Dictionary defines the term as "an attractive and stylish young mother".[10] 
Although not yet as widespread in popular culture at large, the forms DILF (for "Dad/Daddy I'd Like to Fuck") or FILF (for "Father I'd Like to Fuck") are used among androphiles to refer to a sexually attractive older man[11] who is likely a father. 
"Yummy" is a song by Canadian singer Justin Bieber. It was released on January 3, 2020, along with a lyric video through Def Jam Recordings, as the lead single from his fifth studio album, Changes.[1] The song is Bieber's first single as a solo artist to be released in almost four years, following his March 2016 single, "Company", a song from his 2015 album Purpose.[2][3][4][5] Bieber joined the video-sharing social networking service TikTok on the day of the song's release.[6] 
"Yummy" received mixed reviews from music critics, some of whom complimented on Bieber's vocal performance while others criticized the song's production, its songwriting, and Bieber's delivery. The song debuted at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, while reaching the top five in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and various other countries, and hitting number one in New Zealand. The song's official music video was released on January 4, 2020. 
The song was first teased by Bieber on October 27, 2019, when he took to Instagram to tease the title of the song by drawing it on a piece of paper.[7] The song's genre which he dubbed “R&BIEBER” was also teased on the following day with another post uploaded onto his Instagram account.[8] 
"Yummy" is a "straightforward R&B number"[1] that moves along on pop-trap beats.[2][24] Bieber's vocals span from F4 to the high B♭5.[citation needed] The song contains a "crisp bass line and plinking keyboards". 
Bieber rap-sings the pre-chorus, while he hits his "signature falsetto" in the bridge.[22] Bryan Rolli of Forbes magazine called the chorus "seductive", albeit "meaningless".[22] The song is considered an ode to Bieber's wife, Hailey Bieber.[24][22] 
xHamster is a Cypriot pornographic media and social networking site headquartered in Limassol, Cyprus.[1] xHamster serves user-submitted pornographic videos, webcam models, pornographic photographs, and erotic literature, and incorporates social networking features. xHamster was founded in 2007. 
With more than 10 million members, it is the fourth most popular pornography website on the Internet after XVideos, XNXX and Pornhub. 
As of July 2020, xHamster was the 20th most trafficked website in the world.[2] 
In response to Utah lawmakers rejecting a sexual education bill in February 2017, xHamster started presenting a popup to visitors from Utah, offering them to view xHamster's sexual education series "The Box". The rejected House Bill 215 would have allowed parents to opt their children in for more comprehensive sexual education than the abstinence-only sex education common in Utah,[70] but was opposed for encouraging sexual behaviour and allowing children to be taught how to have sex. The bill's sponsor criticized the trend of leaving sexual education to pornographic websites[71] such as xHamster and Pornhub.[72] 
In November 2016, the company released its own beer, xHamster beer. 
The beer is an 8.5% ABV Belgian Triple-style ale. 
Costing €3.90 for 0.55 litres it sold out within five days.[74] 
xHamster has been blocked by various governments. In August 2015, the government of India ordered Internet service providers to block several sites, including xHamster, under the IT Act.[78][79] In Russia, a local court in the Republic of Tatarstan ruled in favour of a block on xHamster and other pornographic websites in April 2014; the ruling was passed on a year later to Roskomnadzor, the state media overseer.[80][81] 
In honor of Pride Month in June 2020 the site held a 3-day live cam fundraiser, inviting activists, artists, sex workers, and LGBTQ+ content creators to submit 15-30 minute segments of content.[123] The content was promoted on the site's social media channels and through its Pride partner Stripchat, and all proceeds were donated to the trans and sex worker charities the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, the Sex Workers Outreach Project and Rainbow Railroad.[123][124] 
In August 2016, Alex Hawkins stated that xHamster would be sponsoring a trip for Brendan Dassey to Wrestlemania. 
He stated "We are pleased that we can make this young man's dream of going to Wrestlemania come true... We have been in talks with the family and they are more than thrilled that Brendan will get this opportunity after so many years of heartache and injustice." 
The idea was started by a change.org petition.[11] 
Pornographic films are typically categorized as either softcore or hardcore pornography. In general, softcore pornography is pornography that does not depict explicit sexual activity, sexual penetration or extreme fetishism.[1] It generally contains nudity or partial nudity in sexually suggestive situations. 
Hardcore pornography is pornography that depicts penetration or extreme fetish acts, or both. It contains graphic sexual activity and visible penetration.[2] A pornographic work is characterized as hardcore if it has any hardcore content. 
Pornographic films are generally classified into subgenres which describe the sexual fantasy which the film and actors attempt to create. Subgenres can also be classified into the characteristics of the performers or the type of sexual activity on which it concentrates and not necessarily on the market to which each subgenre appeals. The subgenres usually conform to certain conventions, and each may appeal to a particular audience. 
Pornographic films (pornos), erotic films, or sex films are films that present sexually explicit subject matter in order to arouse and satisfy the viewer. Pornographic films present sexual fantasies and usually include erotically stimulating material such as nudity (softcore) and sexual intercourse (hardcore). A distinction is sometimes made between "erotic" and "pornographic" films on the basis that the latter category contains more explicit sexuality, and focuses more on arousal than storytelling; the distinction is highly subjective. 
Pastors are to act like shepherds by caring for the flock, and this care includes teaching. The New Testament typically uses the words "bishops" (Acts 20:28) and "presbyter" (1 Peter 5:1) to indicate the ordained leadership in early Christianity. Likewise, Peter instructs these particular servants to "act like shepherds" as they "oversee" the flock of God (1 Pet. 
5:2). The words "bishop" and "presbyter" were sometimes used in an interchangeable way, such as in Titus 1:5-6. However, there is ongoing dispute between branches of Christianity over whether there are two ordained classes (presbyters and deacons) or three (bishops, priests, and deacons). 
The first view is affirmed by the Presbyterian Church.[1] On the other hand, Christians of the Roman Catholic, Persian, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Moravian, Scandinavian Lutheran, Anglican, and Old Catholic, traditions maintain the latter view and affirm the doctrine of apostolic succession.[2][3] 
In the United States, the term pastor is used by Catholics for what in other English-speaking countries is called a parish priest.[citation needed] The Latin term used in the Code of Canon Law is parochus. 
The Church of Sweden has a threefold ministry of bishop, priest, and deacon and those ordained to the presbyterate are referred to as Lutheran priests.[9] In the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, ordained presbyters are referred to by various publications, including Finnish ones, as pastors,[10][11] or priests.[12][13] In the United States, denominations like the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, use the terms reverend and pastor interchangeably for ordained members of the clergy. 
The term "pastor", in the majority of Baptist churches, is one of two offices within the church, deacon being the other, and is considered synonymous with "elder" or "bishop" (though in Reformed Baptist churches, elders are a separate office).[14][15] 
For some Protestants, whether called an elder, bishop, or pastor, these terms describe the same service in the church. In the early Church, only a man could be a presbyter, but many Protestant denominations in the 19th and 20th century have changed to allow women to be pastors. Whether man or woman, this person is to be older and experienced in the faith (i.e., an elder), a person who is a decision-maker, and a manager of church affairs. 
United Methodists ordain to the office of deacon and elder, each of whom can use the title of pastor depending. 
United Methodists also use the title of pastor for non-ordained clergy who are licensed and appointed to serve a congregation as their pastor or associate pastor, often referred to as licensed local pastors. These pastors may be lay people, seminary students, or seminary graduates in the ordination process, and cannot exercise any functions of clergy outside the charge where they are appointed.[18] 
Other religions have started to use the term Pastor for their own ordained leader of congregation such as "Buddhist pastor".[19][20] 
The word "pastor" derives from the Latin noun pastor which means "shepherd" and is derived from the verb pascere – "to lead to pasture, set to grazing, cause to eat".[5] The term "pastor" also relates to the role of elder within the New Testament, and is synonymous with the biblical understanding of minister. 
The term Pastor, Shepherd, and Elder are all the same position. The term "Senior Pastor" does not exist in scripture, but - in multi-staffed churches - is commonly used to denote the pastor who does the preaching. Many Protestant churches call their ministers "pastors". 
Present-day usage of the word is rooted in the Biblical metaphor of shepherding. The Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) uses the Hebrew word רעה‎ (roʿeh), which is used as a noun as in "shepherd", and as a verb as in "to tend a flock."[6] It occurs 173 times in 144 Old Testament verses and relates to the literal feeding of sheep, as in Genesis 29:7. In Jeremiah 23:4, both meanings are used (ro'im is used for "shepherds" and yir'um for "shall feed them"), "And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD." 
English-language translations of the New Testament usually render the Greek noun ποιμήν (poimēn) as "shepherd" and the Greek verb ποιμαίνω (poimainō) as "feed". The two words occur a total of 29 times in the New Testament, most frequently referring to Jesus. For example, Jesus called himself the "Good Shepherd" in John 10:11. 
Krishna (/ˈkrɪʃnə/,[13] Sanskrit pronunciation: [ˈkr̩ʂɳɐ] (listen); Sanskrit: कृष्ण, IAST: Kṛṣṇa) is a major deity in Hinduism. 
He is worshipped as the eighth avatar of Vishnu and also as the supreme God in his own right.[14] He is the god of protection, compassion, tenderness, and love[15][1][2] and is one of the most popular and widely revered among Indian divinities.[16] Krishna's birthday is celebrated every year by Hindus on Krishna Janmashtami according to the lunisolar Hindu calendar, which falls in late August or early September of the Gregorian calendar.[17][18] 
The anecdotes and narratives of Krishna's life are generally titled as Krishna Leela. 
He is a central character in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata Purana, the Brahma Vaivarta Purana and the Bhagavad Gita, and is mentioned in many Hindu philosophical, theological, and mythological texts.[19] They portray him in various perspectives: a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, and as the universal supreme being.[20] His iconography reflects these legends, and shows him in different stages of his life, such as an infant eating butter, a young boy playing a flute, a young boy with Radha or surrounded by women devotees, or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to Arjuna.[21] 
Many early converts to the religion including Brigham Young,[11] Orson Pratt, and Lyman Johnson, recorded that Joseph Smith was teaching plural marriage privately as early as 1831 or 1832. 
Pratt reported that Smith told some early members in 1831 and 1832 that plural marriage was a true principle, but that the time to practice it had not yet come.[12] Johnson also claimed to have heard the doctrine from Smith in 1831.[13] Mosiah Hancock reported that his father was taught about plural marriage in the spring of 1832.[14] 
The 1835 and 1844 versions of the church's Doctrine and Covenants (D&C) prohibited polygamy and declared that monogamy was the only acceptable form of marriage: 
As early as 1832, Mormon missionaries worked successfully to convert followers in Maine of polygamist religious leader Jacob Cochran, who went into hiding in 1830 to escape imprisonment due to his practice of polygamy. Among Cochran's marital innovations was "spiritual wifery," and "tradition assumes that he received frequent consignments of spiritual consorts, and that such were invariably the most robust and attractive women in the community."[17] The majority of what became the Quorum of the Twelve in 1835 attended Mormon conferences held in the center of the Cochranite territory in 1834 and 1835.[18][19][20][21] Brigham Young, an apostle of the church, became acquainted with Cochran's followers as he made several missionary journeys through the Cochranite territory from Boston to Saco,[22] and later married Augusta Adams Cobb, a former Cochranite.[23][24] 
Joseph Smith publicly condemned polygamy, denied his involvement in it, and participants were excommunicated, as church records and publications reflect.[25][26] But church leaders nevertheless began practicing polygamy in the 1840s, particularly members of the Quorum of the Twelve.[27] Sidney Rigdon, while he was estranged from the church, wrote a letter in backlash to the Messenger and Advocate in 1844 condemning the church's Quorum of the Twelve and their alleged connection to polygamy: 
At the time, the practice was kept secret from non-members and most church members. Throughout his life, Smith publicly denied having multiple wives.[29] 
Polygamy (called plural marriage by Latter-day Saints in the 19th century or the Principle by modern fundamentalist practitioners of polygamy) was practiced by leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) for more than half of the 19th century,[1] and practiced publicly from 1852 to 1890 by between 20 and 30 percent of Latter-day Saint families.[2][3] Today, various denominations of fundamentalist Mormonism continue to practice polygamy.[4] 
Mormon polygamy was one of the leading moral issues of the 19th Century in the United States, perhaps second only to slavery in importance. Spurred by popular indignation, the U.S. government took a number of steps against polygamy; these were of varying effectiveness.[57][58] 
As the LDS Church settled in what became the Utah Territory, it eventually was subjected to the power and opinion of the United States. 
Friction first began to show in the James Buchanan administration and federal troops arrived (see Utah War). Buchanan, anticipating Mormon opposition to a newly appointed territorial governor to replace Brigham Young, dispatched 2,500 federal troops to Utah to seat the new governor, thus setting in motion a series of misunderstandings in which the Mormons felt threatened.[59] 
The church was losing control of the territorial government, and many members and leaders were being actively pursued as fugitives. Without being able to appear publicly, the leadership was left to navigate "underground." 
After visiting priesthood leaders in many settlements, church president Wilford Woodruff left for San Francisco on September 3, 1890, to meet with prominent businessmen and politicians. He returned to Salt Lake City on September 21, determined to obtain divine confirmation to pursue a course that seemed to be agonizingly more and more clear. As he explained to church members a year later, the choice was between, on the one hand, continuing to practice plural marriage and thereby losing the temples, "stopping all the ordinances therein," and, on the other, ceasing plural marriage in order to continue performing the essential ordinances for the living and the dead. 
Woodruff hastened to add that he had acted only as the Lord directed: 
Over time, many of those who rejected the LDS Church's relinquishment of plural marriage formed small, close-knit communities in areas of the Rocky Mountains. These groups continue to practice "the Principle." 
In the 1940s, LDS Church apostle Mark E. Petersen coined the term "Mormon fundamentalist" to describe such people.[67] Fundamentalists either practice as individuals, as families, or as part of organized denominations. Today, the LDS Church objects to the use of the term "Mormon fundamentalists" and suggests using the term "polygamist sects" to avoid confusion about whether the main body of Mormon believers teach or practice polygamy.[68] 
Mormon fundamentalists believe that plural marriage is a requirement for exaltation and entry into the highest level of the celestial kingdom. These beliefs stem from statements by 19th-century Mormon authorities including Brigham Young (although some of these leaders gave possibly conflicting statements that a monogamist may obtain at least a lower degree of "exaltation" through mere belief in polygamy).[69] 
As early as the publication of the Book of Mormon in 1830, Latter Day Saint doctrine maintained that polygamy was allowable only if it was commanded by God. The Book of Jacob condemned polygamy as adultery,[73] but left open the proviso that "For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise, they shall hearken unto these things."[74] Thus, the LDS Church today teaches that plural marriage can only be practiced when specifically authorized by God. 
According to this view, the 1890 Manifesto and Second Manifesto rescinded God's prior authorization given to Joseph Smith. 
However, Bruce R. McConkie controversially stated in his 1958 book, Mormon Doctrine, that God will "obviously" re-institute the practice of polygamy after the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.[75][76] This echoes earlier teachings by Brigham Young that the primary purpose of polygamy was to bring about the Millennium.[77] Current official church materials do not make any mention of the future re-institution of plural marriage. 
According to church policy, after a man has died, he may be sealed by proxy to all of the women to whom he was legally married while he was alive. The same is true for women; however, if a woman was sealed to a man while she was alive, all of her husbands must be deceased before she can be sealed by proxy to them.[1][82] 
Church doctrine is not entirely specific on the status of men or women who are sealed by proxy to multiple spouses. There are at least two possibilities: 
Critics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that plural marriages produced unhappiness in some wives.[83] LDS historian Todd Compton, in his book In Sacred Loneliness, described various instances where some wives in polygamous marriages were unhappy with polygamy.[53] 
Carbon dioxide was the first gas to be described as a discrete substance. 
In about 1640,[24] the Flemish chemist Jan Baptist van Helmont observed that when he burned charcoal in a closed vessel, the mass of the resulting ash was much less than that of the original charcoal. His interpretation was that the rest of the charcoal had been transmuted into an invisible substance he termed a "gas" or "wild spirit" (spiritus sylvestris).[25] 
The symmetry of a carbon dioxide molecule is linear and centrosymmetric at its equilibrium geometry. 
The length of the carbon-oxygen bond in carbon dioxide is 116.3 pm, noticeably shorter than the roughly 140-pm length of a typical single C–O bond, and shorter than most other C–O multiply-bonded functional groups such as carbonyls.[1] Since it is centrosymmetric, the molecule has no electric dipole moment. 
The relative concentrations of CO 2, H 2CO 3, and the deprotonated forms HCO− 3 (bicarbonate) and CO2− 3(carbonate) depend on the pH. As shown in a Bjerrum plot, in neutral or slightly alkaline water (pH > 6.5), the bicarbonate form predominates (>50%) becoming the most prevalent (>95%) at the pH of seawater. 
In very alkaline water (pH > 10.4), the predominant (>50%) form is carbonate. 
The oceans, being mildly alkaline with typical pH = 8.2–8.5, contain about 120 mg of bicarbonate per liter. 
This is the true first acid dissociation constant, defined as K a 1 = [ H C O 3 − ] [ H + ] [ H 2 C O 3 ] {\displaystyle K_{a1}={\frac {\rm {[HCO_{3}^{-}][H^{+}]}}{\rm {[H_{2}CO_{3}]}}}} , where the denominator includes only covalently bound H2CO3 and does not include hydrated CO2(aq). 
The much smaller and often-quoted value near 4.16×10−7 is an apparent value calculated on the (incorrect) assumption that all dissolved CO2 is present as carbonic acid, so that K a 1 ( a p p a r e n t ) = [ H C O 3 − ] [ H + ] [ H 2 C O 3 ] + [ C O 2 ( a q ) ] {\displaystyle K_{\mathrm {a1} }{\rm {(apparent)}}={\frac {\rm {[HCO_{3}^{-}][H^{+}]}}{\rm {[H_{2}CO_{3}]+[CO_{2}(aq)]}}}} . 
Since most of the dissolved CO2 remains as CO2 molecules, Ka1(apparent) has a much larger denominator and a much smaller value than the true Ka1.[32] 
The bicarbonate ion is an amphoteric species that can act as an acid or as a base, depending on pH of the solution. At high pH, it dissociates significantly into the carbonate ion (CO32−): 
Carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO 2) is an acidic colorless gas with a density about 53% higher than that of dry air. Carbon dioxide molecules consist of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. It occurs naturally in Earth's atmosphere as a trace gas. 
The current concentration is about 0.04% (412 ppm) by volume, having risen from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm.[10][11] Natural sources include volcanoes, hot springs and geysers, and it is freed from carbonate rocks by dissolution in water and acids. Because carbon dioxide is soluble in water, it occurs naturally in groundwater, rivers and lakes, ice caps, glaciers and seawater. 
It is present in deposits of petroleum and natural gas. Carbon dioxide has a sharp and acidic odor and generates the taste of soda water in the mouth.[12] However, at normally encountered concentrations it is odorless.[4] 
Carbon dioxide is colorless. 
At low concentrations the gas is odorless; however, at sufficiently-high concentrations, it has a sharp, acidic odor.[1] At standard temperature and pressure, the density of carbon dioxide is around 1.98 kg/m3, about 1.53 times that of air.[36] 
Carbon dioxide is used by the food industry, the oil industry, and the chemical industry.[1] The compound has varied commercial uses but one of its greatest uses as a chemical is in the production of carbonated beverages; it provides the sparkle in carbonated beverages such as soda water, beer and sparkling wine. 
In the chemical industry, carbon dioxide is mainly consumed as an ingredient in the production of urea, with a smaller fraction being used to produce methanol and a range of other products.[51] Some carboxylic acid derivatives such as sodium salicylate are prepared using CO2 by the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction.[52] 
In addition to conventional processes using CO2 for chemical production, electrochemical methods are also being explored at a research level. In particular, the use of renewable energy for production of fuels from CO2 (such as methanol) is attractive as this could result in fuels that could be easily transported and used within conventional combustion technologies but have no net CO2 emissions.[53] 
Plants require carbon dioxide to conduct photosynthesis. The atmospheres of greenhouses may (if of large size, must) be enriched with additional CO2 to sustain and increase the rate of plant growth.[54][55] At very high concentrations (100 times atmospheric concentration, or greater), carbon dioxide can be toxic to animal life, so raising the concentration to 10,000 ppm (1%) or higher for several hours will eliminate pests such as whiteflies and spider mites in a greenhouse.[56]

Sperm donation is the provision by a man of his sperm with the intention that it be used in the artificial insemination or other 'fertility treatment' of a woman or women who are not his sexual partners in order that they may become pregnant by him. Where pregnancies go to full term, the sperm donor will be the biological father of every baby born from his donations.[1] 
A sperm donor may donate sperm privately or through a sperm bank, sperm agency, or other brokerage arrangement. Donations from private donors are most commonly carried out using artificial insemination. 
Sperm donation may also be known as 'semen donation'. A man provides his semen but the purpose of the donation is that his gametes contained within the semen, i.e. the sperm cells, be used to provide pregnancies for third parties. 
Generally, a male who provides sperm as a sperm donor gives up all legal and other rights over the biological children produced from his sperm.[10] Private arrangements may permit some degree of co-parenting although this will not strictly be 'sperm donation', and the enforceability of those agreements varies by jurisdiction. 
Donors may or may not be paid, according to local laws and agreed arrangements. Even in unpaid arrangements, expenses are often reimbursed. 
Depending on local law and on private arrangements, men may donate anonymously or agree to provide identifying information to their offspring in the future.[11] Private donations facilitated by an agency often use a "directed" donor, when a male directs that his sperm is to be used by a specific person. Non-anonymous donors are also called "known donors", "open donors" or "identity disclosure donors".[2] 
A sperm donor will usually donate sperm to a sperm bank under a contract, which typically specifies the period during which the donor will be required to produce sperm, which generally ranges from six to 24 months depending on the number of pregnancies which the sperm bank intends to produce from the donor. If a sperm bank has access to world markets e.g. by direct sales, or sales to clinics outside their own jurisdiction, a male may donate for a longer period than two years, as the risk of consanguinity is reduced (although local laws vary widely). 
The contract may also specify the place and hours for donation, a requirement to notify the sperm bank in the case of acquiring a sexual infection, and the requirement not to have intercourse or to masturbate for a period of usually 2–3 days before making a donation.[12] 
The donor masturbates to provide an ejaculate or by the use of an electrical stimulator, although a special condom, known as a collection condom, may be used to collect the semen during sexual intercourse. The ejaculate is collected in a small container, which is usually extended with chemicals in order to provide a number of vials, each of which would be used for separate inseminations. The sperm is frozen and quarantined, usually for a period of six months, and the donor is re-tested prior to the sperm being used for artificial insemination.[1] 
The frozen vials will then be sold directly to a recipient or through a medical practitioner or fertility center and they will be used in fertility treatments. Where a woman becomes pregnant by a donor, that pregnancy and the subsequent birth must normally be reported to the sperm bank so that it may maintain a record of the number of pregnancies produced from each donor. 
Tatenda Tsumba (born 12 November 1991) is a male Zimbabwean sprinter.[2] He competed in the 200 metres at the 2015 World Championships. 
Lovemore Tatenda Gumunyu Manatsa (born 17 May 1990) is a Zimbabwean cricketer.[1][2] 
He made his first-class debut for Northerns in 2008/09 season. 
Tatenda later went on to play for Mashonaland Eagles in first-class cricket, List A cricket and T20 cricket.[3][4] He made into the Zimbabwe A team for the series against Afghanistan in 2014. 
Carol Creighton Burnett was born on April 26, 1933, in San Antonio, Texas,[9][10][11][12] the daughter of Ina Louise (née Creighton), a publicity writer for movie studios, and Joseph Thomas Burnett, a movie theater manager. 
Her maternal grandparents were William Henry Creighton (1873–1918) and Mabel Eudora "Mae" Jones (1885–1967).[13] Both of her parents were alcoholics, and at a young age she was left with her grandmother. Her parents divorced in the late 1930s; her mother then moved to Hollywood, and she and her grandmother moved to a one-room apartment near her mother's in an impoverished area of Hollywood, California. There they stayed in a boarding house with Burnett's younger half-sister Chrissie.[14] 
After spending her first year in New York working as a hat-check girl and failing to land acting jobs, Burnett, along with other girls living at the Rehearsal Club (a boarding house for women seriously pursuing acting careers) put on The Rehearsal Club Revue on March 3, 1955. They mailed invitations to agents, who showed up along with stars like Celeste Holm and Marlene Dietrich, which opened doors for several of the girls. She was cast in a minor role on The Paul Winchell and Jerry Mahoney Show in 1955. 
Carol Creighton Burnett (born April 26, 1933) is an American actress, comedienne, singer and writer. She is best known for her groundbreaking comedy variety show The Carol Burnett Show, which originally aired on CBS. It was one of the first of its kind to be hosted by a woman.[1][2] She has achieved success on stage, television and film in varying genres including dramatic and comedic roles. 
She has also appeared on various talk shows and as a panelist on game shows. 
A missionary is a member of a religious group sent into an area to promote their faith or perform ministries of service, such as education, literacy, social justice, health care, and economic development.[1][2] 
A Christian missionary can be defined as "one who is to witness across cultures".[1] The Lausanne Congress of 1974, defined the term, related to Christian mission as, "to form a viable indigenous church-planting movement". Missionaries can be found in many countries around the world. 
In the Latin translation of the Bible, Jesus Christ uses the word when sending the disciples to preach the gospel in his name. The term is most commonly used for Christian missions, but can be used for any creed or ideology.[3] 
Much contemporary Catholic missionary work has undergone profound change since the Second Vatican Council of 1962–1965, with an increased push for indigenization and inculturation, along with social justice issues as a constitutive part of preaching the Gospel. 
As the Catholic Church normally organizes itself along territorial lines and had the human and material resources, religious orders, some even specializing in it, undertook most missionary work, especially in the era after the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West. Over time, the Holy See gradually established a normalized Church structure in the mission areas, often starting with special jurisdictions known as apostolic prefectures and apostolic vicariates. 
At a later stage of development these foundations are raised to regular diocesan status with a local bishops appointed. 
On a global front, these processes were often accelerated in the later 1960s, in part accompanying political decolonization. 
In some regions, however, they are still in course. 
Early Protestant missionaries included John Eliot and contemporary ministers including John Cotton and Richard Bourne, who ministered to the Algonquin natives who lived in lands claimed by representatives of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the early 17th century. Quaker "publishers of truth" visited Boston and other mid-17th century colonies, but were not always well received.[18] 
With a dramatic increase in efforts since the 20th century, and a strong push since the Lausanne I: The International Congress on World Evangelization in Switzerland in 1974,[19] modern evangelical groups have focused efforts on sending missionaries to every ethnic group in the world. While this effort has not been completed, increased attention has brought larger numbers of people distributing Bibles, Jesus videos, and establishing evangelical churches in more remote areas. 
What can be viewed as a success by those inside and outside the church from this focus is a higher level of cooperation and friendliness among churches and denominations. It is very common for those working on international fields to not only cooperate in efforts to share their gospel message, but view the work of their groups in a similar light. Also, with the increased study and awareness of different people groups, western mission efforts have become far more sensitive to the cultural nuances of those they are going to and those they are working with in the effort. 
Nigeria, and other countries have had large numbers of their Christian adherents go to other countries and start churches. These non-western missionaries often have unparalleled success; because, they need few western resources and comforts to sustain their livelihood while doing the work they have chosen among a new culture and people. 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has an active missionary program. Young men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five are encouraged to prepare themselves to serve a two-year, self-funded, full-time proselytizing mission. Young women who desire to serve as missionaries can serve starting at the age of nineteen, for one and a half years. 
Retired couples also have the option of serving a mission. Missionaries typically spend two weeks in a Missionary Training Center (or two to three months for those learning a new language) where they study the scriptures, learn new languages when applicable, prepare themselves to teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and learn more about the culture and the people they live among. As of December 2019, the LDS Church had over 67,000 full-time missionaries worldwide[23] and over 31,000 Service Missionaries.[24] 
In Montreal in 1910, Father James Anthony Walsh, a priest from Boston, met Father Thomas Frederick Price, from North Carolina. They agreed on the need to build a seminary for the training of young American men for the foreign Missions. 
Countering arguments that the Church needed workers here, Fathers Walsh and Price insisted the Church would not flourish until it sent missioners overseas.[25] Independently, the men had written extensively about the concept, Father Price in his magazine Truth, and Father Walsh in the pages of A Field Afar, an early incarnation of Maryknoll Magazine.[26] Winning the approval of the American hierarchy, the two priests traveled to Rome in June 1911 to receive final approval from Pope Pius X for the formation of the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America, now better known as the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers.[27] 
Dawah means to "invite" (in Arabic, literally "calling") to Islam, which is the second largest religion with 1.6 billion members.[39] From the 7th century, it spread rapidly from the Arabian Peninsula to the rest of the world through the initial Muslim conquests and subsequently with traders and explorers after the death of Muhammad.

She won the silver medal in the youth category and the bronze medal in the senior category at the 2010 Archery European Indoor Championships held in Poreč, Croatia.[3][5] At the 2010 European Archery Championships held in Rovereto, Italy, Ünsal became bronze medalist.[9] She owns a gold medal won in the team event of the 2010 European Junior Cu, which took place in Reggio Calabria, Italy.[2][6] 
Nedime Elif Ağca Yarar (born February 10, 1984 in Ankara), also known as Nedime Elif Ağca Öner, is a retired national level Turkish volleyball player who last played for Fenerbahçe. She is 186 cm (6 ft 1 in) tall and plays as setter. 
She studied at Marmara University.[1] 
Since the 2012/2013 season, she plays for the Turkish club Fenerbahçe.[2] She played with this club in the 2012 FIVB Club World Championship and won the bronze medal and the Best Setter award[3] after defeating Puerto Rico's Lancheras de Cataño 3-0.[4] 
Elif Batuman (born 1977) is an American author, academic, and journalist.[1] She is the author of two books: a memoir, The Possessed, and a novel The Idiot, which was a finalist for the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Batuman is a staff writer for The New Yorker. 
Russian literature figures heavily in Batuman's work. Batuman says that her obsession with Russian literature began when she read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s The Gulag Archipelago in high school.[1] Both The Possessed and The Idiot pay homage to Batuman's favorite Russian writer, Fyodor Dostoevsky.[8] 
Rona Jaffe Foundation Writers' Award, 2007.[15] Whiting Award, 2010.[16] Finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, 2017. 
Elif Batuman was born in New York City to Turkish parents, and grew up in New Jersey. She graduated from Harvard College, and received her doctorate in comparative literature from Stanford University.[2] While attending graduate school, Batuman studied the Uzbek language in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Her dissertation, The Windmill and the Giant: Double-Entry Bookkeeping in the Novel,[3] is about the process of social research and solitary construction undertaken by novelists.[3] 
In February 2010, Batuman published her first book, The Possessed: Adventures with Russian Books and the People Who Read Them, based on material she previously published in The New Yorker,[4] Harper's Magazine,[5] and N+1,[6][7] which details her experiences as a comparative literature graduate student at Stanford University. Reviewing the book for The New York Times, critic Dwight Garner praised the "winsome and infectious delight she feels in the presence of literary genius and beauty."[5] 
Batuman’s novel The Idiot is partly based on her own experiences attending Harvard in the mid-1990s and teaching English in Hungary in the summer of 1996.[8] It was a finalist for the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.[9] 
Batuman's 2018 article in The New Yorker on Japan's rental family industry won the National Magazine Award. In 2021, the magazine returned the award after an investigation revealed that three subjects in the essay had made false statements to Batuman and the magazine's fact-checkers.[12]

While results vary slightly across reputable studies, the consensus is that the mean human penis, when erect, is in the range 12.9–15 cm (5.1–5.9 in) in length.[3][4][5] 
Human penises vary in size on a number of measures, including length and circumference when flaccid and erect. Besides the natural variability of human penises in general, there are factors that lead to minor variations in a particular male, such as the level of arousal, time of day, room temperature, anxiety level, sport activity and frequency of sexual activity. Compared to other primates, including large examples such as the gorilla, the human penis is thickest, both in absolute terms and relative to the rest of the body. 
Talunan or talonan is a Filipino chicken soup or stew characterized by its sour flavor. 
It is prepared like a combination of Philippine adobo and paksiw, with vinegar, garlic, ginger, black peppercorns, patis (fish sauce), bay leaves, and salt. 
Some recipes add pork to the dish. The name literally means "loser" in Tagalog, as it was traditionally cooked from the tough meat of losing roosters used in cockfighting.[1][2][3][4] 
Sex shops in Australia are regulated by state laws and are subject to local planning controls. 
While laws differ between states, licensees must abide by strict conditions that commonly require premises to be at least 200 metres from schools and churches. Windows are often required to be blacked out and admission restricted to over 18s, with offences prosecuted by police under section 578E of the Crimes Act.[4] 
In the state of New South Wales (NSW) sex shops cannot trade at street level and are required to trade either above or below ground.[citation needed] Under NSW law, non-contraceptive sex products can be sold only in shops that have been granted a restricted premise licence by local councils. Nevertheless, by 2013 a number of NSW lingerie stores had begun selling adult toys and books in shopping malls without being granted a licence.[1] 
China 
In 2013 there were over 2,000 sex shops in Beijing. Most of their products were made in China.[5] 
The first sex shop in North America was called The Garden. 
It was opened in October 1971 by Ivor Sargent on Crescent Street in downtown Montreal, Quebec. The Garden combined the concepts used by Beate Uhse in Germany and Ann Summers in the UK.[6] The store's opening attracted long lines of shoppers. 
The Palm Beach Post commented: "Like the chicken or the egg controversy, no one is really sure which came first-the sex boutique or the so-called sexual revolution".[7] 
There are no specific laws against using or buying sex toys at any particular age, but there are laws restricting the purchase of pornography. Although the age of consent is 16 in Canada, an age of 18+ is required to purchase or view pornography. Most sex shops sell adult videos, which means that most sex toys remain strictly in the hands of adults.[citation needed] 
The first sex shop in Italy was opened in 1972 in Milan by Angela Masia and her husband Ercole Sabbatini.[citation needed] This was the first "official" sex shop. 
Since then more sex shops have opened, mostly in Rome.[citation needed] In 2018 the city of Pistoia in Tuscany banned the opening of new sex shops in the city's history centre.[8] 
In Japan, sex shops contain hentai magazines, adult videos and DVDs.[citation needed] 
The first sex shops in the Netherlands were opened in the early 1970s, by entrepreneurs like Beate Uhse and Lasse Braun. The world's first Muslim-aimed online sex shop called El Asira opened in the Netherlands in 2010. 
It had 70,000 hits to the website in the first four days of operation.[9] 
Sex shops are extremely rare in Singapore. 
A few had been opened by 2005,[10] but only about 1–2 currently exist. These shops mainly sell lingerie and various sex toys. Their goods can be seen through a store window.[citation needed] 
After Nelson Mandela backed the anti-discrimination law that legalised sex toys,[11] "Adult World" was established in 1994 as South Africa's first sex shop. Adult World came to operate a total of 52 shops within South Africa and 15 shops in Australia.[12] Many religious Christian communities believed that the use of these adult lifestyle centres would lead to higher crime rates and attempted to organise mass demonstrations at their opening to force the closure of Adult World.[13] 
The adult movie star Christi Lake attended the opening of the shop, where a protest march of over 500 people brought traffic to a standstill. During the next couple of days the protesters held placards which proclaimed "Real men don't need pornography" and "Protect our people from banned pornography". When the shop was opened, it was found that 70% of the customer base were women who wished to learn more about adult lifestyle products.[14] 
As Adult World grew more popular, a focus on the development of adult shops within Australia took place.[1] 
Almost all licensed adult stores in the UK are forbidden from having their wares in open shop windows under the Indecent Displays Act 1981, which means often the shop fronts are boarded up or covered in posters. A warning sign must be clearly shown at the entrance to the store, and no sex articles (for example, pornography or sex toys) should be visible from the street. However, lingerie, non-offensive covers of adult material, etc. may be shown depending on the licence conditions of the local authority. 
The Video Recordings Act 1984 introduced the R18-rated classification for videos that are only available in licensed sex shops. No customer can be under 18 years old. 
In London, few boroughs that have licensed sex shops. In the district of Soho within the City of Westminster a handful of sex shops were opened by Carl Slack in the early 1960s, and by the mid-1970s the number had grown to 59.[15] Some had nominally "secret" backrooms selling hardcore photographs and novels, including Olympia Press editions. 
By the 1980s, purges of corrupt police officers, along with new and tighter licensing controls by the City of Westminster, led to a crackdown on illegal premises in Soho. In the early 1990s, London's Hackney council sought to shut down Sh! Women's Erotic Emporium, because they did not have a licence. 
Sh! took the council to court and consequently won the right to remain open, as there were no sufficient reasons for the closure. In 2003, the Ann Summers chain of lingerie and sex toy shops won the right to advertise for shop assistants in Job Centres, which was originally banned under restrictions on what advertising could be carried out by the sex industry.[16] In 2007, a Northern Ireland sex shop was denied a licence by the Belfast City Council. The shop appealed and won, but this was overturned by the House of Lords.[17] 
The licensing or closing of unlicensed sex shops, along with cultural changes such as the substantial relaxation of general censorship and the ready availability of non-commercial sex, and the availability of sexual material online, have reduced the red-light district of Soho to just a small area. The borough has 15 licensed sex shops and several remaining unlicensed ones. Islington and Camden each have multiple sex shops; the former also has three pornographic cinemas. 
Sex shops in Scotland are regulated under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. 
United States 
A sex shop (also called adult shop, erotic shop or adult book store) is a retailer that sells products related to adult sexual or erotic entertainment, such as sex toys, lingerie, clothing, pornography, and other related products. 
In the United States, a series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1960s (based on the First Amendment to the United States Constitution) generally legalized sex shops, while still allowing states and local jurisdictions to limit them through zoning.[citation needed] Zoning regulations often caused shops to be located either on the outskirts of town, or clumped into a single area, creating a type of red light district of adult stores and businesses. 
Into the 1980s, nearly all American sex shops were oriented to an almost entirely male clientele.[citation needed] Many included adult video arcades, and nearly all were designed so that their customers could not be seen from the street: they lacked windows, and the doors often involved an L-shaped turn so that people on the street could not see in.[citation needed] In addition, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, stores that also had theaters or arcades were sometimes closed by government order, citing the spread of AIDS as the motive.[18] 
On the one hand, there are stores resembling the UK's Ann Summers, tending toward "softer" product lines.[citation needed] On the other hand, there are stores that evolved specifically out of a sex-positive culture, such as San Francisco's Good Vibrations and Xandria. The latter class of stores tend to be very consciously community-oriented businesses, sponsoring lecture series and being actively involved in sex-related health issues, etc.

Arguably the grandmother of the modern sex shop was a chain of stores set up in the 1920s by Léon Vidal of Diana Slip fame, in Paris. His shops sold erotic books, photographs and lingerie.[1] 
Sex shops have operated in Australia since the 1960s, first in the urban areas of Sydney, notably Kings Cross.[citation needed] The development of sex shops in the country was assisted by the legalisation of the import of pornographic magazines in 1971, the appearance of mass-produced battery-powered vibrators in the 1970s and the arrival of X-rated videos in the 1980s. The popularity of Internet pornography in the 2000s resulted in a drop in sex shop sales, some store closures and diversification into non-sex-related adult goods.[3] 
The use of the term to describe what are essentially cupcakes or buns did not become common usage in Britain until the last decades of the 20th century on the back of the spread of coffee shops such as Starbucks. Recipes for quickbread muffins are common in 19th-century American cookbooks.[7][8] Recipes for yeast-based muffins, which were sometimes called "common muffins" or "wheat muffins" in 19th-century American cookbooks, can be found in much older cookbooks. 
In Fannie Farmer's Boston Cooking-School Cook Book, she gave recipes for both types of muffins, both those that used yeast to raise the dough and those that used a quick bread method, using muffin rings to shape the English muffins. 
Farmer indicated that stove top "baking", as is done with yeast dough, was a useful method when baking in an oven was not practical.[9] Over the years, the size and calorie content of muffins has changed: the "3-inch muffins grandmother made had only 120 to 160 calories. But today’s giant bakery muffins contain from 340 to 630 calories each."[10] 
Quickbread muffins are made with flour, sieved together with bicarbonate of soda as a raising agent. To this is added butter or shortening, eggs and any flavourings (fruit, such as blueberries, chocolate or banana; or savouries, such as cheese). 
Bran muffins use less flour and use bran instead, as well as using molasses and brown sugar.[1] The mix is turned into a pocketed muffin tray, or into individual paper moulds, and baked in an oven. 
Milk is often added, as it contributes to the appealing browning appearance.[6]The result are raised, individual quickbreads.[2] The muffin may have toppings added, such as cinnamon sugar, streusel,[6] nuts, or chocolate chips. 
The muffin top is the crisp upper part of the muffin, which has developed a "browned crust that's slightly singed around the edges".[17] They were the focus of a 1997 Seinfeld sitcom episode, "The Muffin Tops" (episode 21 of season 8), where the character Elaine, who only eats the tops when she buys a muffin, realizes that a bakery selling just the tops could be successful. 
Once the business is running, she has to figure out what to do with the muffin bottoms, which proves difficult. 
Cups or cases are usually round sheets of paper, foil, or silicone[19] with scallop-pressed edges, giving the muffin a round cup shape. They are used in the baking of muffins to line the bottoms of muffin tins, to facilitate the easy removal of the finished muffin from the tin. The advantage to cooks is easier removal and cleanup, more precise form, and moister muffins; however, using them will prevent a crust from forming. 
A variety of sizes for muffin cases are available. 
Slightly different sizes are considered "standard" in different countries. Miniature cases are commonly 1 to 1.25 in (25 to 32 mm) in diameter at the base and .75 in (19 mm) tall. 
Standard-size cases range from 1.75 to 2 inches (44 to 51 mm) in diameter at the base and are 1.25 to 1.5 in (32 to 38 mm) tall. Some jumbo-size cases can hold more than twice the size of standard cases. 
Australian and Swedish bakers are accustomed to taller paper cases with a larger diameter at the top than American and British bakers.[20] 
It can refer to two distinct items, a part-raised flatbread that is baked and then cooked on a griddle (typically unsweetened) and a cupcake-like quickbread (often sweetened) that is chemically leavened and then baked in a mold. While quickbread muffins are often sweetened, there are savory varieties made with ingredients such as corn and cheese. The flatbread is of British or European derivation, and dates from at least the early 18th century, while the quickbread originated in North America during the 19th century. 
English muffins were first mentioned in literature in the early 18th century,[23] although the product is undoubtedly older than that. In the Oxford Companion to Food, Alan Davidson states that "[t]here has always been some confusion between muffins, crumpets, and pikelets, both in recipes and in name."[24] The increasing popularity of flatbread muffins in the 19th century, is attested by the existence of "...muffin men [who] traversed the town streets at teatime, ringing their bells" to sell them.[24] The bell-ringing of muffin men became so common that by the 1840s, the British Parliament passed a law to prohibit bell ringing by muffin men, but it was not adhered to by sellers.[24] 
Muffin rings are metal cookware used for oven-baking or griddle-cooking flatbread muffins. 
They are circle-shaped objects made of thin metal. 
The rings are about one inch high. 
One 19th century source suggests that "muffin" may be related to the Greek bread "maphula", a "cake baked on a hearth or griddle", or from Old French "mou-pain" ("soft bread"), which may have been corrupted into "mouffin".[1] The word is first found in print in 1703, spelled moofin;[2] it is of uncertain origin but possibly derived from the Low German Muffen, the plural of Muffe meaning a small cake, or possibly with some connection to the Old French moufflet meaning soft, as said of bread.[3][4] The expression "muffin-man", meaning a street seller of muffins, is attested in a 1754 poem, which includes the line: "Hark! the shrill Muffin-Man his Carol plies.."[4] 
Quickbread muffins (sometimes described in Britain as "American muffins"[5]) are baked, individual-sized, cupcake-shaped foods with a "moist, coarse-grained" texture.[6] Muffins are available in both savoury varieties, such as cornmeal and cheese muffins, or sweet varieties such as blueberry, chocolate chip, lemon or banana flavours. 
Sweetened muffins range from lightly sweetened muffins to products that are "richer than many cakes in fat and sugar."[6] They are similar to cupcakes in size and cooking methods, the main difference being that cupcakes tend to be sweet desserts using cake batter and which are often topped with sugar icing (American frosting). 
Muffins may have solid items mixed into the batter, such as berries, chocolate chips or nuts. 
Fresh baked muffins are sold by bakeries, donut shops and some fast food restaurants and coffeehouses. 
Factory baked muffins are sold at grocery stores and convenience stores and are also served in some coffeeshops and cafeterias.

In 2000 he founded the annual Thisday Awards which honours those who made contributions to Nigerian society in the political arena, global business, Women of distinction, and leading figures in the Nigerian education sector.[21] 
In 2013 he launched an international TV news channel with an African focus, Arise News, signing a contract with Globecast for satellite transmission on Astra 2G for broadcast on the UK Sky platform, and to Hot Bird for cable distribution, with bases in London, New York City, Johannesburg, and Lagos.[22] 
He also founded ARISE Magazine.[23] The publication was launched at the THISDAY Music & Fashion Festival at London's Royal Albert Hall on October 14, 2008[24] and powered The ARISE (AFRICA ) FASHION Week starting in Johannesburg and Cape Town, South Africa, and later finding a home in Lagos Nigeria - after shows with the African Fashion Collectives in the Royal Albert Hall, London; Kennedy Centre, Washington DC; Lincoln Centre, New York. 
The ARISE Fashion Week also featured a few years at The New York and Paris Fashion Weeks.[25] 
Obaigbena started the THISDAY Music and Fashion Festivals in 2006.[26] The event included several musical acts such as Beyonce, Jay Z, Rihanna, John Legend, Lionel Richie, Dianna Ross, Alicia Keys, Mary J Blige, Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Busta Rhyme, Black Eyed Peas, Missy Elliott, Usher, Naomi Campbell, Alec Wek, Liya Kedebe, Oluchi, etc.[27] He also created the concept of THISDAY Awards.[28][29] 
Before the ascent of Arise News, some staff and suppliers complained about Obaigbena's failure to meet payment deadlines.[30] Obaigbena had paid all debts to employees.[31] About three years after the launching of Arise News, Obaigbena was involved in an inquiry being conducted by Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC), which was investigating the spending of a $2.1 billion fund. 
The ensuing course of investigations affected Obaigbena's operations. 
About this period, staff complained and took job action because of the delay in payments.[32][33][34] 
Obaigbena attended Edo College,[3] Benin City, and the University of Benin. He attended the Graduate School of Business at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg and Advanced Management Programme at the University of Cape Town.[4]

He also served as the Acting Dean of the Faculty of Engineering and was also elected as a Member of the Governing Council of the University.[5] 
Necdet (pronounced [nedʒdet]) is a Turkish given name for males. 
People named Necdet include: 
Necdet Calp (1922-1998), Turkish civil servant and politician Necdet Darıcıoğlu, Turkish judge Necdet Karababa, Turkish politician Necdet Kent (1911–2002), Turkish diplomat Ahmet Necdet Sezer, Turkish politician Necdet Turhan (born 1957), Turkish visually impaired mountain climber and long distance runner Necdet Yaşar, Turkish musician 
In an annex to Stanford J. Shaw's book Turkey and the Holocaust (1993), Kent's claims of rescuing Jews during the Holocaust were first published.[2] 
Kent said that, at some time in 1943, an assistant at the Turkish consulate told Kent that the Germans had just loaded 80 Turkish Jews living in Marseilles into cattle cars for immediate transport to probable death in Germany. Kent later recalled, "To this day, I remember the inscription on the wagon: 'This wagon may be loaded with 20 heads of cattle and 500 kilograms of grass'."[11][2] Kent approached the Gestapo commander at the station, and demanded that the Jews be released, as they were Turkish citizens and Turkey was neutral. The official refused to do so, saying that the people were nothing but Jews.[11] 
According to his own account, Kent and his assistant quickly got on the train; the German official asked him to get off, but Kent refused. 
At the next station, German officers boarded and apologized to Kent for not letting him off at Marseilles; they had a car waiting outside to return him to his office. Kent explained that the mistake was that 80 Turkish citizens had been loaded on the train. "As a representative of a government that rejected such treatment for religious beliefs, I could not consider leaving them there," he said. 
Surprised at his uncompromising stance, the Germans ultimately let everyone off the train.[9] 
Kent also claimed that he reached out to the Jewish community, issuing Turkish identity documents to scores of Turkish Jews living in southern France, or those who had fled there and did not hold valid Turkish passports.[1] Kent also said that he went to Gestapo headquarters to protest against their the stripping of males in the street in Marseilles to determine whether or not they were Jews (by circumcision); Kent rebuked the German commander and informed him that circumcision did not necessarily prove an individual's Jewishness, since Muslims are also circumcised.[9] 
Historian Marc David Baer notes several inconsistencies in Kent's story, concluding that it is "manufactured".[4] Historian Corry Guttstadt examines the claims made, concluding that "Kent's heroic action is just completely unfounded". 
She criticized attempts to use "an imaginary rescue of Jews as a publicity tool".[12] 
Kent has not been recognized as Righteous Among the Nations.[14] 
In 2001, Kent, Namık Kemal Yolga and Selahattin Ülkümen, also Turkish diplomats who had worked in Europe and saved Jews during World War II, were honoured with Turkey's Supreme Service Medal.[citation needed] 
Necdet Kent was born in 1911 in Istanbul in the Ottoman Empire and got his secondary education from Galatasaray Lycee, as did some of his colleagues in the foreign ministry. He travelled to the United States for his university studies, earning a degree in public law from New York University. He was also briefly a professional footballer for Hull Fc. 
He was first posted as vice consul to Athens, Greece. In 1941, he was appointed to the post of vice consul at Marseilles, France, a post which he held until 1944. Many refugees gathered in southern France during the war, and Marseilles was a major port of embarkation. 
Necdet Kent married and had children.[1] One son, Muhtar Kent, was the chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company from July 2008 till May 2017. 
General Necdet Özel (born 1950) is a Turkish Army general, who served as the 28th Chief of the General Staff[1] of the Turkish Armed Forces. He also served as the commander of the Turkish Land Forces. 
General Necdet Özel is only the second in this position not to have NATO experience.[2] 
As a General, he served as the Commander of Aegean Army between 2007–2008, as the Commander of the 2nd Army between 2008–2010, and as the Commander of Gendarmerie between 2010–2011. After serving as the Commander of TLFC and as the Acting Commander of the Turkish Armed Forces between 29 July and 4 August 2011, he assumed the command of Turkish Armed Forces (TAF) on 4 August 2011. 
Between 4 August 2011 and 18 August 2015, he served as the 28th Chief of the Turkish General Staff, succeeded by Hulusi Akar.[3] 
Özel is married to Kamuran Özel. They have one child. 
Özel served as a platoon leader and company commander in various units of the Turkish Land Forces Command (TLFC) until 1978. Following his graduation from Army War College in 1980 as a staff officer, he respectively served as Operations Plan Officer at Turkish Peace Forces HQ in Cyprus, Branch Chief and then as the Secretary General at the General Secretariat of Turkish Land Forces, Chief of Staff at the Turkish Military Academy, and as the Commander of the 17th Infantry Regiment. 
Necdet Öztorun (1924, Konya - 7 October 2010, Ankara) was a Turkish general. He was Commander of the First Army of Turkey (1983 - 1984) and then Commander of the Turkish Army (1985 - 1987).[1] 
Necdet Karababa is a Turkish politician and former leader of the Democratic Left Party. 
He was elected leader of the Democratic Left Party at its general assembly held on March 7, 1988 following the resignation and leaving the politics of Bülent Ecevit some time before. 
He resigned from this post on December 28, 1988[1] after ongoing disagreements with Ecevit's spouse Rahşan. Necdet Karababa did not run for this position at the next party convention on January 15, 1989, and was succeeded by Bülent Ecevit, who returned to active politics again following strong demand by party members.[2][3] 
Necdet Darıcıoğlu (May 4, 1926 in Antalya, Turkey – September 14, 2016, Ankara) was a Turkish judge. He was president of the Constitutional Court of Turkey from March 2, 1990 until May 4, 1991.[1] 
Necdet Turhan (born 1957) is a Turkish visually impaired mountaineer and national athlete for long-distance running. In 2017 he completed a project that called for running five marathons on five different continents, and climbing five summits in five different continents. 
Necdet Turhan was born in Balıkesir, Turkey, in 1957.[1] He was schooled in Bursa due to his father's professional assignment. He lost his eyesight due to a corneal disease which began when he was 23. After finishing high school, he studied political science and public administration at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara.[2] He graduated with honours in 1994.[1] 
Turhan started mountaineering by joining the "Mountain Climbing and Winter Sports Club" at his university. He initially faced objection from the club members due to his blindness, but afterwards was allowed to take part in climbing activities. He reached the summits of Bey Dağları, Mt. 
Erciyes, and other peaks in Turkey. He became interested in long-distance running after he met master athletes exercising at the Bursa Atatürk Stadium. In 2000, he took part in the Istanbul Marathon, running in the 15 km (9.3 mi) category.[1] 
He served as district governor, inspector in the Ministry of Interior as well as province governor of Siirt and İzmir. He also served as executive assistant to İsmet İnönü, then prime minister of Turkey. During the military rule between 1980 and 1983, he was the undersecretary of the prime minister Bülent Ulusu. 
In the local elections held on 21 March 1984, in which SODEP also competed, the HP received 8.8%, which meant a loss of nearly 75% of its votes in less than five months. After learning the results, Calp resigned, but he was soon reelected as the chairman. However, during the reelection period, the opposition group in the party gained strength.[3] On the general congress of the party held on 29 June 1985, he lost his chair to Aydın Güven Gürkan. 
After 1985, he did not participate in politics, and in the 1987 elections, he did not run for a seat in the parliament. On 13 September 1998, he died in Ankara as a result of a heart attack.

Any variation of Rock Paper Scissors is an oriented graph. According to theoretical calculations, the number of distinguishable oriented graphs, every of which is a potentially playable Rock Paper Scissors game, grows with the number of weapons = 3, 4, 5, ... as follow:[98] 
7; 42; 582; 21,480; 2,142,288; 575,016,219; 415,939,243,032; … (sequence A001174 in the OEIS). 
Rock paper scissors (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being called "stone", or as Rochambeau, roshambo, or ro-sham-bo)[1][2][3] is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air. 
However, by exploiting the psychological weaknesses of inherently non-random opponents, it is possible to gain a significant advantage.[26][27] Indeed, human players tend to be non-random.[27][28] As a result, there have been programming competitions for algorithms that play rock paper scissors.[26][29][30] 
A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"[4]), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. The type of game originated in China and spread with increased contact with East Asia, while developing different variants in signs over time. 
Rock paper scissors is often used as a fair choosing method between two people, similar to coin flipping, drawing straws, or throwing dice in order to settle a dispute or make an unbiased group decision. Unlike truly random selection methods, however, rock paper scissors can be played with a degree of skill by recognizing and exploiting non-random behavior in opponents.[5][6] 
Play by chimpanzees 
In Japan, researchers have taught chimpanzees to identify winning hands according to the rules of rock paper scissors.[44] 
In many games, it is common for a group of possible choices to interact in a rock paper scissors style, where each selection is strong against a particular choice, but weak against another. Such mechanics can make a game somewhat self-balancing, prevent gameplay from being overwhelmed by a single dominant strategy and single dominant type of unit.[45] 
Many card-based video games in Japan use the rock paper scissors system as their core fighting system, with the winner of each round being able to carry out their designated attack. In Alex Kidd in Miracle World, the player has to win games of rock paper scissors against each boss to proceed. Others use simple variants of rock paper scissors as subgames. 
The common side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana) exhibits a rock paper scissors pattern in its mating strategies. Of its three throat color types of males, "orange beats blue, blue beats yellow, and yellow beats orange" in competition for females, which is similar to the rules of rock-paper-scissors.[47][48] 
Started in 2015 the WRPSA has hosted Professional Rock Paper Scissors Tournaments all around the World.[58][59][60][61][62] 
Several RPS events have been organised in the United Kingdom by Wacky Nation. 
The 1st UK Championship took place on 13 July 2007, and were then held annually. The 2019 event was won by Ellie Mac who went on to pick up the cash prize of £20,000 but was unable to double her earnings in 2020 due to the coronavirus outbreak.[73] 
USA Rock Paper Scissors League is sponsored by Bud Light. Leo Bryan Pacis was the first commissioner of the USARPS.[citation needed] Cody Louis Brown was elected as the second commissioner of the USARPS in 2014.[citation needed] 
The largest Rock Paper Scissors tournament is 2,950 and was achieved by Oomba, Inc. (USA) at Gen Con 2014 in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, on 17 August 2014.[75] 
In the Malaysian version of the game, "scissors" is replaced by "bird," represented with the finger tips of five fingers brought together to form a beak. The open palm represents "water". Bird beats water (by drinking it); stone beats bird (by hitting it); and stone loses to water (because it sinks in it). 
In mammals, sexual differentiation is determined by the sperm that carries either an X or a Y (male) chromosome.[18] The Y chromosome contains a sex-determining gene (SRY) that encodes a transcription factor for the protein TDF (testis determining factor) and triggers the creation of testosterone and anti-Müllerian hormone for the embryo's development into a male.[19][20] This differentiation begins about eight or nine weeks after conception.[19] Some sources state that it continues until the twelfth week,[21] while others state that it is clearly evident by the thirteenth week and that the sex organs are fully developed by the sixteenth week.[22] 
The clitoris (/ˈklɪtərɪs/ (listen) or /klɪˈtɔːrɪs/ (listen)) is a female sex organ present in mammals, ostriches and a limited number of other animals. In humans, the visible portion – the glans – is at the front junction of the labia minora (inner lips), above the opening of the urethra. 
Unlike the penis, the male homologue (equivalent) to the clitoris, it usually does not contain the distal portion (or opening) of the urethra and is therefore not used for urination. The clitoris also usually lacks a reproductive function. While few animals urinate through the clitoris or use it reproductively, the spotted hyena, which has an especially large clitoris, urinates, mates, and gives birth via the organ. 
Males are not vulnerable 
By masculine gender socialization, it is thought that males, even younger males, cannot be victims of rape, nor even that they are vulnerable. 
In some societies, it is considered shameful and unmanly if a male child cries, because the male stereotype depicts males as being able to protect themselves, which may not always be the case.[26][27] Young boys may be weaker and vulnerable to perpetrators, who are usually stronger. 
The perpetrators can use whatever they have to abuse the child, including money or other bribes.[27] An adult male may also be helpless to fight back, or fearful of doing so because of the possibility of being arrested for assault and/or battery due to social double standards regarding the use of force in self-defense between genders, in some cases of female perpetrators (this double standard is similar to the concern of male self-defense against non-sexual assault by a female). 
A common societal belief is that a male must be aroused if he gets an erection or has an orgasm, therefore that means that he is willing and enjoying any sexual activity. 
Roy J. Levin and Willy Van Berlo wrote in an article in the Journal of Clinical Forensic Medicine that slight genital stimulation or stress can create erections "even though no specific sexual stimulation is present". 
An erection does not mean that the men consent to sex.[1] Males can get erections even in traumatic or painful sexual situations, and this does not indicate consent.[2] 
Much like female erectile response, male erectile response is involuntary,[29][30] meaning that a man need not be aroused for his penis to become erect; mechanical stimulation is all that is necessary. Arousal and stimulation are distinct things. Stimulation is a physical response to a stimulus. 
Men can be physically stimulated without feeling aroused and thus causing an erection. Men can be scared and intimidated into an erection, especially if the person is older or an authority.[31] 
A proportion of victims of rape or other sexual violence incidents are male. Historically, rape was thought to be, and defined as, a crime committed solely against females. This belief is still held in some parts of the world, but rape of males is now commonly criminalized and has been subject to more discussion than in the past.[1] 
Across Africa, men who are raped often face social stigmatization and being ridiculed for being "weak" and failing to prevent the rape.[38][39][40] They may also be accused of homosexuality (which is illegal in many countries of the region). For example, when some male refugees from the Congo sought treatment in Uganda, they were prosecuted for homosexuality, The Economist reported in 2012.[41] 
In northern Uganda, in recent years there have been ongoing attacks by rebel groups against the government forces. During these conflicts, civilian men have often been attacked, kidnapped, raped and forced to fight for the rebel groups.[1] Victims of rape often face serious physical, emotional, and psychological trauma as a result of their experience.[42] 
Sexual abuse results in severe emotional and often physical trauma.[43] Among sexual assault victims over 18, 31.5% of females and 16.1% of males said that they incurred non-genital injuries from the assault.[44] 
Rape of males is still taboo, and has a negative connotation among heterosexual and homosexual men.[2][3] Community and service providers often react differently to male victims based on their sexual orientation and the gender of their perpetrators.[4] It may be difficult for male victims to report a sexual assault they experienced, especially in a society with a strong masculine custom. They might be afraid that people will doubt their sexual orientation and label them homosexual, especially if raped by a male, or that they may be seen as un-masculine because they were a victim. 
Male victims received more ancillary injuries and were more likely to be threatened with a weapon by the perpetrator. The symptoms and injuries most frequently noted are tension headaches, ulcers, nausea, colitis, abrasions to the throat, black eyes and broken bones. The study by Stermac and colleagues (2004) noted that 45% of male victims who went to a hospital sexual assault centre had some type of physical injury (25% soft tissue injury, 20% lacerations).[1][2][3][45] 
Most of the time, male victims try to hide and deny their victimization, similar to female victims, unless they have serious physical injuries. Eventually, the male victims may be very vague in explaining their injuries when they are seeking medical or mental health services.[1] 
Healing therapy 
Research about male-victim rape had only just begun to appear by 1980, focusing mostly on male children. The studies of sexual assault in correctional facilities focusing specifically on the consequences of this kind of rape were available in the early 1980s, but nothing was available during the previous years. Most of the literature regarding rape and sexual assault focuses on female victims.[5]

Teen was an American teen and lifestyle magazine for preteen and early teenage girls, ages 10 to 15. The content of Teen included advice, entertainment news, quizzes, fashion, beauty, celebrity role models, and "real-girl stories".[1] The magazine was published between 1954 and 2009.[2] 
Following the closure of its Cosmogirl in October, Hearst Magazines decided in December 2008[2] to end publication of Teen magazine. The winter 2009 issue was the last. A spokesperson said “We will continue to publish the annual Teen Prom issue, but will focus our teen publishing efforts on the Seventeen brand.” 
The spokesperson also noted that teenmag.com would be absorbed into the Hearst Teen Network of sites over the next month.[5] 
The magazine had nine sections: New Stuff, Tech Girl, Celeb Stuff, Celebs, Look, Fashion, Get Real, Absolutely You, and More. 
New Stuff was a section that talks about anything recently released that is attractive to its readership, such as technology, accessories, clothes, and makeup. The Tech Girl section was specifically about technology, especially "trendy" technology and game reviews. 
The Look section concerned beauty articles, such as those concerning hair and makeup. Fashion was a clothing section that talked about knits, jeans, clothes for individual body shapes, crafts, and a quiz. 
The articles included "True Stories from Real Teens", where teens send in their personal essays, "Ask Sophi", an advice column for dating questions, and a quiz. Absolutely You has advice and quizzes about your personal life, crushes, and body. More, at the end of the magazine, included fortune telling, a fictional story, horoscopes, comics, and "Why Me?", a collection of embarrassing stories from readers' real life experiences.[3] 
The magazine released Teen Mag Music 2000 Volume 1, a compilation music CD.[4] 
The group consisted of Kristina "Teeny" Lieberson, former keyboardist for the Brooklyn band Here We Go Magic, her two sisters Katherine and Lizzie, and Boshra AlSaadi.[1] The Lieberson sisters, daughters of noted composer Peter Lieberson,[2] hail originally from Halifax, Nova Scotia. 
In May 2013, TEEN released their EP, Carolina on Carpark Records. 
In 2015, TEEN toured with Will Butler of Arcade Fire.[3] 
In 2016, TEEN toured with of Montreal.[4] 
In 2019, TEEN announced it was disbanding after two final shows in Chicago and New York.[5] 
The United Nations defines youth as persons between the ages of 15 and 24 with all UN statistics based on this range, the UN states education as a source for these statistics. The UN also recognizes that this varies without prejudice to other age groups listed by member states such as 18–30. 
A useful distinction within the UN itself can be made between teenagers (i.e. those between the ages of 13 and 19) and young adults (those between the ages of 20 and 29). 
While seeking to impose some uniformity on statistical approaches, the UN itself is aware of contradictions between approaches in its own statutes. Hence under the 15–24 definition (introduced in 1981) children are defined as those under the age of 14 while under the 1979 Convention on the Rights of the Child, those under the age of 18 are regarded as children.[10] The UN also states they are aware that several definitions exist for youth within UN entities such as Youth Habitat 15–32 and African Youth Charter 15–35. 
Although linked to biological processes of development and aging, youth is also defined as a social position that reflects the meanings different cultures and societies give to individuals between childhood and adulthood. The term in itself when referred to in a manner of social position can be ambiguous when applied to someone of an older age with very low social position; potentially when still dependent on their guardians.[12] Scholars argue that age-based definitions have not been consistent across cultures or times and that thus it is more accurate to focus on social processes in the transition to adult independence for defining youth.[13] 
"This world demands the qualities of youth: not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the life of ease." – Robert Kennedy[14] 
Youth is the stage of constructing the self-concept. The self-concept of youth is influenced by variables such as peers, lifestyle, gender, and culture.[15] It is a time of a person's life when their choices are most likely to affect their future.[16][17] 
In much of sub-Saharan Africa, the term "youth" is associated with young men from 15 to 30 or 35 years of age. Youth in Nigeria includes all members of the Federal Republic of Nigeria aged 18–35.[18] Many African girls experience youth as a brief interlude between the onset of puberty and marriage and motherhood. But in urban settings, poor women are often considered youth much longer, even if they bear children outside of marriage. 
Varying culturally, the gender constructions of youth in Latin America and Southeast Asia differ from those of sub-Saharan Africa. In Vietnam, widespread notions of youth are sociopolitical constructions for both sexes between the ages of 15 and 35.[19] 
In Brazil, the term youth refers to people of both sexes from 15 to 29 years old. This age bracket reflects the influence on Brazilian law of international organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO). It is also shaped by the notion of adolescence that has entered everyday life in Brazil through a discourse on children's rights.[1] 
The intergovernmental organization Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development defines youth as "those between 15 and 29 years of age".[20][21] 
Children's rights cover all the rights that belong to children. When they grow up they are granted with new rights (like voting, consent, driving, etc.) and duties (criminal response, etc.). 
There are different minimum limits of age at which youth are not free, independent or legally competent to take some decisions or actions. Some of these limits are: voting age, age of candidacy, age of consent, age of majority, age of criminal responsibility, drinking age, driving age, etc. After youth reach these limits they are free to vote, have sexual intercourse, buy or consume alcoholic beverages or drive cars, etc. 
Typically, the age is set at 18 years; however, ages as low as 16 and as high as 21 exist (see list below). Studies show that 21% of all 18-year-olds have experience with voting. This is an important right since, by voting, they can support politics selected by themselves and not only by people of older generations. 
Youth is the time of life when one is young, and often means the time between childhood and adulthood (maturity).[1][2] It is also defined as "the appearance, freshness, vigor, spirit, etc., characteristic of one who is young".[3] Its definitions of a specific age range varies, as youth is not defined chronologically as a stage that can be tied to specific age ranges; nor can its end point be linked to specific activities, such as taking unpaid work or having sexual relations.[4][5] 
Age of candidacy is the minimum age at which a person can legally qualify to hold certain elected government offices. In many cases, it also determines the age at which a person may be eligible to stand for an election or be granted ballot access. 
The age of consent is the age at which a person is considered legally competent to consent to sexual acts, and is thus the minimum age of a person with whom another person is legally permitted to engage in sexual activity. The distinguishing aspect of the age of consent laws is that the person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim, and their sex partner as the offender. 
The defense of infancy is a form of defense known as an excuse so that defendants falling within the definition of an "infant" are excluded from criminal liability for their actions, if at the relevant time, they had not reached an age of criminal responsibility. This implies that children lack the judgment that comes with age and experience to be held criminally responsible. After reaching the initial age, there may be levels of responsibility dictated by age and the type of offense committed. 
Youth is an experience that may shape an individual's level of dependency, which can be marked in various ways according to different cultural perspectives. Personal experience is marked by an individual's cultural norms or traditions, while a youth's level of dependency means the extent to which they still rely on their family emotionally and economically.[1] 
The legal drinking age is the age at which a person can consume or purchase alcoholic beverages. These laws cover a wide range of issues and behaviors, addressing when and where alcohol can be consumed. The minimum age alcohol can be legally consumed can be different from the age when it can be purchased in some countries. 
These laws vary among different countries and many laws have exemptions or special circumstances. Most laws apply only to drinking alcohol in public places, with alcohol consumption in the home being mostly unregulated (an exception being the UK, which has a minimum legal age of five for supervised consumption in private places). Some countries also have different age limits for different types of alcoholic drinks.[22] 
Driving age is the age at which a person can apply for a driver's license. Countries with the lowest driving ages (below 17) are Argentina, Australia, Canada, El Salvador, Iceland, Israel, Estonia, Macedonia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Sweden, the United Kingdom (Mainland) and the United States. 
The Canadian province of Alberta and several U.S. states permit youth driving as low as 14. Niger has the highest minimum driving age in the world at 23. In India, driving is legal after getting a license at the age of 18. 
The legal working age is the minimum age required by law for a person to work in each country or jurisdiction. The threshold of adulthood, or "the age of majority" as recognized or declared in law in most countries, has been set at age 18. 
Some types of labor are commonly prohibited even for those above the working age, if they have not reached the age of majority. Activities that are dangerous, harmful to the health or that may affect the morals of minors fall into this category. 
Student rights are those rights, such as civil, constitutional, contractual and consumer rights, which regulate student rights and freedoms and allow students to make use of their educational investment. These include such things as the right to free speech and association, to due process, equality, autonomy, safety and privacy, and accountability in contracts and advertising, which regulate the treatment of students by teachers and administrators. 
The smoking age is the minimum age a person can buy tobacco and/or smoke in public. Most countries regulate this law at the national level while at some point it is done by the state or province. 
Young people spend much of their lives in educational settings, and their experiences in schools, colleges and universities can shape much of their subsequent lives.[23] Research shows that poverty and income affect the likelihood for the incompletion of high school. 
These factors also increase the likelihood for the youth to not go to a college or university.[24] In the United States, 12.3 percent of young people ages 16 to 24 are disconnected, meaning they are neither in school nor working.[25] 
The leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults are due to certain health-risk behaviors. These behaviors are often established during youth and extend into adulthood. Since the risk behaviors in adulthood and youth are interrelated, problems in adulthood are preventable by influencing youth behavior. 
A 2004 mortality study of youth (defined in this study as ages 10–24) mortality worldwide found that 97% of deaths occurred in low to middle-income countries, with the majority in southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Maternal conditions accounted for 15% of female deaths, while HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis were responsible for 11% of deaths; 14% of male and 5% of female deaths were attributed to traffic accidents, the largest cause overall. Violence accounted for 12% of male deaths. 
Suicide was the cause of 6% of all deaths.[26] 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed its Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) in 2003 to help assess risk behavior.[27] YRBSS monitors six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults. These are behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; 
tobacco, alcohol and other drug use; sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; unhealthy dietary behaviors; physical inactivity—plus overweight. 
Discrimination against overweight children begins early in childhood and becomes progressively institutionalized. Obese children may be taller than their non-overweight peers, in which case they are apt to be viewed as more mature. The inappropriate expectations that result may have an adverse effect on their socialization. 
Bullying among school-aged youth is increasingly being recognized as an important problem affecting well-being and social functioning. While a certain amount of conflict and harassment is typical of youth peer relations, bullying presents a potentially more serious threat to healthy youth development. The definition of bullying is widely agreed on in literature on bullying.[31][32][33][34] 
The majority of research on bullying has been conducted in Europe and Australia.[citation needed] Considerable variability among countries in the prevalence of bullying has been reported. In an international survey of adolescent health-related behaviors, the percentage of students who reported being bullied at least once during the current term ranged from a low of 15% to 20% in some countries to a high of 70% in others.[35][36] Of particular concern is frequent bullying, typically defined as bullying that occurs once a week or more. 
The prevalence of frequent bullying reported internationally ranges from a low of 1.9% among one Irish sample to a high of 19% in a Malta study.[37][38][39][40][41][42] 
Research examining characteristics of youth involved in bullying has consistently found that both bullies and those bullied demonstrate poorer psychosocial functioning than their non-involved peers. Youth who bully others tend to demonstrate higher levels of conduct problems and dislike of school, whereas youth who are bullied generally show higher levels of insecurity, anxiety, depression, loneliness, unhappiness, physical and mental symptoms, and low self-esteem. Males who are bullied also tend to be physically weaker than males in general. 
The few studies that have examined the characteristics of youth who both bully and are bullied found that these individuals exhibit the poorest psychosocial functioning overall.[43][44][45][46] 
Globalization and transnational flows have had tangible effects on sexual relations, identities, and subjectivities. In the wake of an increasingly globalized world order under waning Western dominance, within ideologies of modernity, civilization, and programs for social improvement, discourses on population control, 'safe sex', and 'sexual rights'.[47] Sex education programmes grounded in evidence-based approaches are a cornerstone in reducing adolescent sexual risk behaviours and promoting sexual health. In addition to providing accurate information about consequences of Sexually transmitted disease or STIs and early pregnancy, such programmes build life skills for interpersonal communication and decision making. 
Such programmes are most commonly implemented in schools, which reach large numbers of teenagers in areas where school enrollment rates are high. However, since not all young people are in school, sex education programmes have also been implemented in clinics, juvenile detention centers and youth-oriented community agencies. Notably, some programmes have been found to reduce risky sexual behaviours when implemented in both school and community settings with only minor modifications to the curricula.[48] 
The Sangguniang Kabataan ("Youth Council" in English), commonly known as SK, was a youth council in each barangay (village or district) in the Philippines, before being put "on hold", but not quite abolished, prior to the 2013 barangay elections.[49] The council represented teenagers from 15 to 17 years old who have resided in their barangay for at least six months and registered to vote. It was the local youth legislature in the village and therefore led the local youth program and projects of the government. The Sangguniang Kabataan was an offshoot of the KB or the Kabataang Barangay (Village Youth) which was abolished when the Local Government Code of 1991 was enacted. 
The vast majority of young people live in developing countries: according to the United Nations, globally around 85 per cent of 15- to 25-year-olds live in developing countries, a figure projected to grow 89.5 per cent by 2025. Moreover, this majority are extremely diverse: some live in rural areas but many inhabit the overcrowded metropolises of India, Mongolia and other parts of Asia and in South America, some live traditional lives in tribal societies, while others participate in global youth culture in ghetto contexts.[50] 
Many young lives in developing countries are defined by poverty, some suffer from famine and a lack of clean water, while involvement in armed conflict is all common. Health problems are rife, especially due to the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in certain regions. The United Nations estimates that 200 million young people live in poverty, 130 million are illiterate and 10 million live with HIV/AIDS.[1] 
Around the world, the English terms youth, adolescent, teenager, kid, and young person are interchanged, often meaning the same thing,[6] but they are occasionally differentiated. Youth can be referred to as the time of life when one is young. 
This involves childhood, and the time of life which is neither childhood nor adulthood, but rather somewhere in between.[7][8] Youth also identifies a particular mindset of attitude, as in "He is very youthful". For certain uses, such as employment statistics, the term also sometimes refers to individuals from the ages of 14 to 21.[9] However, the term adolescence refers to a specific age range during a specific developmental period in a person's life, unlike youth which is a socially constructed category.[5] 
However, perhaps coincidentally, similar words in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian were used from 1410 for certain medicinal herbs. 
These probably derived from the Arabic طُبّاق‎ ṭubbāq (also طُباق‎ ṭubāq), a word reportedly dating to the 9th century, referring to various herbs.[7][8] 
The tobacco industry advertises its products through a variety of media, including sponsorship, particularly of sporting events. Because of the health risks of these products, this is now one of the most highly regulated forms of marketing. 
Some or all forms of tobacco advertising are banned in many countries.[citation needed] 
Tobacco has long been used in the Americas, with some cultivation sites in Mexico dating back to 1400–1000 BCE.[9] Many Native American tribes traditionally grow and use tobacco. 
Historically, people from the Northeast Woodlands cultures have carried tobacco in pouches as a readily accepted trade item. It was smoked both socially and ceremonially, such as to seal a peace treaty or trade agreement.[10][11] In some Native cultures, tobacco is seen as a gift from the Creator, with the ceremonial tobacco smoke carrying one's thoughts and prayers to the Creator.[12] 
Following the scientific revelations of the mid-20th century, tobacco was condemned as a health hazard, and eventually became recognized as a cause of cancer, as well as other respiratory and circulatory diseases. In the United States, this led to the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which settled the many lawsuits by the U.S. states in exchange for a combination of yearly payments to the states and voluntary restrictions on advertising and marketing of tobacco products.[citation needed] 
In the 1970s, Brown & Williamson cross-bred a strain of tobacco to produce Y1, a strain containing an unusually high nicotine content, nearly doubling from 3.2-3.5% to 6.5%. In the 1990s, this prompted the Food and Drug Administration to allege that tobacco companies were intentionally manipulating the nicotine content of cigarettes.[citation needed] 
In 2003, in response to growth of tobacco use in developing countries, the World Health Organization[21] successfully rallied 168 countries to sign the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. 
The convention is designed to push for effective legislation and enforcement in all countries to reduce the harmful effects of tobacco.[22] 
Many species of tobacco are in the genus of herbs Nicotiana. 
It is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) indigenous to North and South America, Australia, south west Africa, and the South Pacific.[24] 
Most nightshades contain varying amounts of nicotine, a powerful neurotoxin to insects. 
However, tobaccos tend to contain a much higher concentration of nicotine than the others. Unlike many other Solanaceae species, they do not contain tropane alkaloids, which are often poisonous to humans and other animals. 
Despite containing enough nicotine and other compounds such as germacrene and anabasine and other piperidine alkaloids (varying between species) to deter most herbivores,[25] a number of such animals have evolved the ability to feed on Nicotiana species without being harmed. Nonetheless, tobacco is unpalatable to many species due to its other attributes. 
For example, although the cabbage looper is a generalist pest, tobacco's gummosis and trichomes can harm early larvae survival.[26] As a result, some tobacco plants (chiefly N. glauca) have become established as invasive weeds in some places. 
Tobacco is the common name of several plants in the Nicotiana genus of the Solanaceae family, and the general term for any product prepared from the cured leaves of these plants. More than 70 species of tobacco are known, but the chief commercial crop is N. tabacum. 
The more potent variant N. rustica is also used in some countries. 
Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes and cigars, as well as pipes and shishas. They can also be consumed as snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco and snus. 
Tobacco contains the highly addictive stimulant alkaloid nicotine as well as harmala alkaloids.[3] Tobacco use is a cause or risk factor for many deadly diseases; especially those affecting the heart, liver, and lungs, as well as many cancers. In 2008, the World Health Organization named tobacco use as the world's single greatest preventable cause of death.[4] 
The English word tobacco originates from the Spanish and Portuguese word "tabaco". The precise origin of this word is disputed, but it is generally thought to have derived, at least in part, from Taíno, the Arawakan language of the Caribbean. In Taíno, it was said to mean either a roll of tobacco leaves (according to Bartolomé de las Casas, 1552), or to tabago, a kind of L-shaped pipe used for sniffing tobacco smoke (according to Oviedo, with the leaves themselves being referred to as cohiba).[5][6] 
Many of the categories for particular types of drugs are listed in Category:Drugs by target organ system and Category:Drugs by mechanism of action. 
A medication or medicine is a drug taken to cure or ameliorate any symptoms of an illness or medical condition. The use may also be as preventive medicine that has future benefits but does not treat any existing or pre-existing diseases or symptoms. Dispensing of medication is often regulated by governments into three categories—over-the-counter medications, which are available in pharmacies and supermarkets without special restrictions; behind-the-counter medicines, which are dispensed by a pharmacist without needing a doctor's prescription, and prescription only medicines, which must be prescribed by a licensed medical professional, usually a physician.[18] 
These medications are designated by the letter P on the label.[19] The range of medicines available without a prescription varies from country to country. Medications are typically produced by pharmaceutical companies and are often patented to give the developer exclusive rights to produce them. Those that are not patented (or with expired patents) are called generic drugs since they can be produced by other companies without restrictions or licenses from the patent holder.[20] 
Caffeine, contained in coffee and other beverages, is the most widely used psychoactive drug in the world.[1] 90% of North American adults consume the substance on a daily basis.[2] 
Some religions, particularly ethnic religions, are based completely on the use of certain drugs, known as entheogens, which are mostly hallucinogens,—psychedelics, dissociatives, or deliriants. Some drugs used as entheogens include kava which can act as a stimulant, a sedative, a euphoriant and an anesthetic. The roots of the kava plant are used to produce a drink which is consumed throughout the cultures of the Pacific Ocean. 
Some shamans from different cultures use entheogens, defined as "generating the divine within"[21] to achieve religious ecstasy. Amazonian shamans use ayahuasca (yagé) a hallucinogenic brew for this purpose. Mazatec shamans have a long and continuous tradition of religious use of Salvia divinorum a psychoactive plant. 
Its use is to facilitate visionary states of consciousness during spiritual healing sessions.[22] 
Silene undulata is regarded by the Xhosa people as a sacred plant and used as an entheogen. Its roots are traditionally used to induce vivid (and according to the Xhosa, prophetic) lucid dreams during the initiation process of shamans, classifying it a naturally occurring oneirogen similar to the more well-known dream herb Calea ternifolia.[23] 
Peyote a small spineless cactus has been a major source of psychedelic mescaline and has probably been used by Native Americans for at least five thousand years.[24][25] Most mescaline is now obtained from a few species of columnar cacti in particular from San Pedro and not from the vulnerable peyote.[26] 
The entheogenic use of cannabis has also been widely practised[27] for centuries.[28] Rastafari use marijuana (ganja) as a sacrament in their religious ceremonies. 
Nootropics, also commonly referred to as "smart drugs", are drugs that are claimed to improve human cognitive abilities. 
Nootropics are used to improve memory, concentration, thought, mood, and learning. An increasingly used nootropic among students, also known as a study drug, is methylphenidate branded commonly as Ritalin and used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy.[29] At high doses methylphenidate can become highly addictive.[30] Serious addiction can lead to psychosis, anxiety and heart problems, and the use of this drug is related to a rise in suicides, and overdoses. 
Evidence for use outside of student settings is limited but suggests that it is commonplace.[29][30] Intravenous use of methylphenidate can lead to emphysematous damage to the lungs, known as Ritalin lung.[31] 
Other drugs known as designer drugs are produced. 
An early example of what today would be labelled a 'designer drug' was LSD, which was synthesised from ergot.[32] Other examples include analogs of performance-enhancing drugs such as designer steroids taken to improve physical capabilities and these are sometimes used (legally or not) for this purpose, often by professional athletes.[33] Other designer drugs mimic the effects of psychoactive drugs. 
Since the late 1990s there has been the identification of many of these synthesised drugs. In Japan and the United Kingdom this has spurred the addition of many designer drugs into a newer class of controlled substances known as a temporary class drug. 
Cannabis is a commonly used recreational drug.[34] 
Recreational drug use is the use of a drug (legal, controlled, or illegal) with the primary intention of altering the state of consciousness through alteration of the central nervous system in order to create positive emotions and feelings. The hallucinogen LSD is a psychoactive drug commonly used as a recreational drug.[35] 
Some national laws prohibit the use of different recreational drugs; and medicinal drugs that have the potential for recreational use are often heavily regulated. 
However, there are many recreational drugs that are legal in many jurisdictions and widely culturally accepted. 
Cannabis is the most commonly consumed controlled recreational drug in the world (as of 2012).[36] Its use in many countries is illegal but is legally used in several countries usually with the proviso that it can only be used for personal use. It can be used in the leaf form of marijuana (grass), or in the resin form of hashish. Marijuana is a more mild form of cannabis than hashish. 
There may be an age restriction on the consumption and purchase of legal recreational drugs. Some recreational drugs that are legal and accepted in many places include alcohol, tobacco, betel nut, and caffeine products, and in some areas of the world the legal use of drugs such as khat is common.[37] 
There are a number of legal intoxicants commonly called legal highs that are used recreationally. The most widely used of these is alcohol. 
A drug is any chemical substance that causes a change in an organism's physiology or psychology when consumed.[3][4] Drugs are typically distinguished from food and substances that provide nutritional support. 
Consumption of drugs can be via inhalation, injection, smoking, ingestion, absorption via a patch on the skin, suppository, or dissolution under the tongue. 
All drugs, can be administered via a number of routes, and many can be administered by more than one. 
There are numerous governmental offices in many countries that deal with the control and oversee of drug manufacture and use, and the implementation of various drug laws. The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs is an international treaty brought about in 1961 to prohibit the use of narcotics save for those used in medical research and treatment. In 1971, a second treaty the Convention on Psychotropic Substances had to be introduced to deal with newer recreational psychoactive and psychedelic drugs. 
The legal status of Salvia divinorum varies in many countries and even in states within the United States. Where it is legislated against the degree of prohibition also varies. 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States is a federal agency responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the regulation and supervision of food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, prescription and over-the-counter medications, vaccines, biopharmaceuticals, blood transfusions, medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices, cosmetics, animal foods[39] and veterinary drugs. 
In India, the Narcotics Control Bureau (abbr. 
NCB) ,an Indian federal law enforcement and intelligence agency under the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India is tasked with combating drug trafficking and assisting international use of illegal substances under the provisions of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.[40] 
In pharmacology, a drug is a chemical substance, typically of known structure, which, when administered to a living organism, produces a biological effect.[5] A pharmaceutical drug, also called a medication or medicine, is a chemical substance used to treat, cure, prevent, or diagnose a disease or to promote well-being.[2] Traditionally drugs were obtained through extraction from medicinal plants, but more recently also by organic synthesis.[6] Pharmaceutical drugs may be used for a limited duration, or on a regular basis for chronic disorders.[7]

In English, the noun "drug" is thought to originate from Old French "drogue", possibly deriving from "droge (vate)" from Middle Dutch meaning "dry (barrels)", referring to medicinal plants preserved as dry matter in barrels.[16][17]

Smoking is primarily practised as a route of administration for recreational drug use because the combustion of the dried plant leaves vaporizes and delivers active substances into the lungs where they are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and reach bodily tissue. In the case of cigarette smoking these substances are contained in a mixture of aerosol particles and gases and include the pharmacologically active alkaloid nicotine; the vaporization creates heated aerosol and gas into a form that allows inhalation and deep penetration into the lungs where absorption into the bloodstream of the active substances occurs. In some cultures, smoking is also carried out as a part of various rituals, where participants use it to help induce trance-like states that, they believe, can lead them to spiritual enlightenment. 
Tobacco smoking is the most popular form, being practised by over one billion people globally, of whom the majority are in the developing countries.[1] Less common drugs for smoking include cannabis and opium. Some of the substances are classified as hard narcotics, like heroin, but the use of these is very limited as they are usually not commercially available. Cigarettes are primarily industrially manufactured but also can be hand-rolled from loose tobacco and rolling paper. 
There are many different tobacco cultivars which are made into a wide variety of mixtures and brands. Tobacco is often sold flavored, often with various fruit aromas, something which is especially popular for use with water pipes, such as hookahs. The second most common substance that is smoked is cannabis, made from the flowers or leaves of Cannabis sativa or Cannabis indica. 
The substance is considered illegal in most countries in the world and in the countries that tolerate public consumption, it is sometimes only pseudo-legal. Despite this, a considerable percentage of the adult population in many countries have tried it with smaller minorities doing it on a regular basis. Since cannabis is illegal or only tolerated in many jurisdictions, there is no industrial mass-production of cigarettes, meaning that the most common form of smoking is with hand-rolled cigarettes (often called joints) or with pipes. 
Most of these substances are controlled, and some are considerably more intoxicating than either tobacco or cannabis. These include crack cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and PCP. A small number of psychedelic drugs are also smoked, including DMT, 5-Meo-DMT, and Salvia divinorum. 
This has resulted in a staggering variety of smoking tools and paraphernalia from all over the world. Whether tobacco, cannabis, opium or herbs, some form of receptacle is required along with a source of fire to light the mixture. The most common today is by far the cigarette, consisting of a mild inhalant strain of tobacco in a tightly rolled tube of paper, usually manufactured industrially and including a filter, or hand-rolled with loose tobacco. 
A less common but increasingly popular alternative to smoking is vaporizers, which use hot air convection to deliver the substance without combustion, which may reduce health risks. A portable vaporization alternative appeared in 2003 with the introduction of electronic cigarettes, battery-operated, cigarette-shaped devices which produce an aerosol intended to mimic the smoke from burning tobacco, delivering nicotine to the user without some of the harmful substances released in tobacco smoke. 
Other than actual smoking equipment, many other items are associated with smoking; cigarette cases, cigar boxes, lighters, matchboxes, cigarette holders, cigar holders, ashtrays, silent butlers, pipe cleaners, tobacco cutters, match stands, pipe tampers, cigarette companions and so on. Some examples of these have become valuable collector items and particularly ornate and antique items can fetch high prices. 
Among the diseases that can be caused by smoking are vascular stenosis, lung cancer,[55] heart attacks[56] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.[57] Smoking during pregnancy may cause ADHD to a fetus.[58] 
Mammary intercourse, a form of non-penetrative sex between a man and a woman 
Non-penetrative sex may sometimes be divided into acts that are exclusively non-penetrative and those that are not.[by whom?] Exclusively non-penetrative sexual acts include: 
Axillary intercourse: (slang: "bagpiping", in reference to the underarm manner in which bagpipes are played; directing traffic, or pit-wank, a variant of the term tit-wank, are also terms for axillary intercourse). 
It is a sexual variant where the penis is inserted in the other person's armpit.[30][31][32] Bundling: a courtship tradition in some Christian communities that was opposed by the religious right and has largely died out. 
The two young people were each in a sack tied up at the neck, and put in a bed together for the night. 
Erotic massage: rubbing of the body to create pleasure and relaxation. 
This can be done between two or more people of any gender and sexual orientation. 
It can involve the use of oils (heated or otherwise) or just the individual's hands. 
It is also known as sensual massage.[33][34] Footjob: sexually stimulating one individual's penis with another individual's feet. 
In some cases it can be part of a foot fetish. One individual places their feet around the penis and caresses it until orgasm is achieved. 
Variations where the clitoris is stimulated by feet also occur.[35] Frot: act of genital-genital rubbing between males (especially penis-to-penis contact). 
Handjob: the manual sexual stimulation of another person's penis, often as a form of mutual masturbation. 
Intercrural sex: when the penis is stimulated by placing it between another individual's thighs. 
Lubrication may be used to allow the penis to move more freely between the thighs.[7][36][37] Intergluteal sex: stimulation of the penis using the buttocks, often used as a form of mutual masturbation. 
It differs from anal sex because no penetration of the anus occurs. 
The penis is stimulated by moving between the buttocks.[38] Kissing: the touching of one person's lips against another person's can be regarded as a sexual act, especially deep kissing (French kissing) where one person inserts his tongue into the partner's mouth. 
Kissing may also be done on other parts of the body and is commonly a part of foreplay.[39] Mammary intercourse: the stimulation of the penis by placing the penis between the breasts and moving the penis up and down to simulate penetration and to create pleasure.[40] Stimulation of nipples: when one partner caresses (either manually or orally) the nipples of their partner. 
Any individual can participate in this act and it can be done in pairs or groups.[41] Tribadism: a form of lesbian sex where women rub genitalia against each other (either rubbing genitalia together or rubbing one's genitalia against other parts of another individual's body).[42][43] 
Fingering: stimulation of the vagina, vulva, clitoris in particular, or anus, with the fingers. 
It is often used as a form of mutual masturbation. 
Oral sex: stimulation of the genitals using the mouth and throat. 
It is known as fellatio when the act is performed on a penis, and cunnilingus when performed on female genitalia.[44] A specific type of oral sex, anilingus, is the stimulation of the anus using the mouth.[45] Stimulation using a vibrator: a partner or group of individuals may stimulate each other's genitals using a vibrator.[46] BDSM: Many BDSM activities do not involve penetration.[47] 
Non-penetrative sex or outercourse is sexual activity that usually does not include sexual penetration. 
It generally excludes the penetrative aspects of vaginal, anal, or oral sexual activity, but includes various forms of sexual and non-sexual activity, such as frottage, mutual masturbation, kissing, or cuddling.[1][2][3] Some forms of non-penetrative sex, particularly when termed outercourse, include penetrative aspects, such as penetration that may result from forms of fingering or oral sex.[4][5][6] 
In many developed countries, there is a trend where young individuals (typically late teens and early twenties) engage in casual sex, also known as a hookup. 
This phenomenon has been termed hookup culture. The term hookup in this context loosely means participating in some type of sexual activity (whether it is non-penetrative or penetrative) with another individual or group of individuals outside of a romantic relationship.[48] 
When performed as a non-penetrative sex act, the act is continued until the man ejaculates. At that time, the semen typically covers the intermammary sulcus or part of the breast. 
It may also reach the woman's face, resulting in a facial. When it covers the woman's neck, it may be called a "pearl necklace". 
Mammary intercourse is a sex act, performed as either foreplay or as non-penetrative sex, that involves the stimulation of a man's penis by a woman's breasts and vice versa.[1] It involves placing the penis between a woman's breasts and moving the penis up and down to simulate sexual penetration and to create sexual pleasure. It may be used as an alternative to a handjob. 
Practice 
Mammary intercourse involves a man kneeling or sitting on a woman's stomach or chest, placing his erect penis on her cleavage, and rubbing or thrusting while the breasts are squeezed around the penile shaft, by either the woman or the man, creating tightness similar to masturbation,[1] and in simulation of penetrative sex. A lubricant, masturbation cream, or saliva may be used between the breasts or on the penis. Alternatively, the woman can tighten her breasts around the penis and move them back and forth. 
The woman normally does not receive direct sexual stimulation during mammary intercourse, other than the erotic stimulation of bringing her partner to orgasm, without sexual penetration. However, Alex Comfort has said that mammary intercourse can produce orgasm in women with sensitive breasts (what Margot Anand terms local orgasms of the breast), and it was one of the nine substitute exercises for penetrative sexual activities, as detailed in the Paradis Charnels of 1903.[4][5] It is possible for the man to perform a fingering on the woman during mammary intercourse. 
Since mammary intercourse is a non-penetrative sex act, the risk of passing a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that requires direct contact between the mucous membranes and pre-ejaculate or semen is greatly reduced. 
HIV is among the infections that require such direct contact and is therefore very unlikely to be transmitted via mammary intercourse.[6] A study of the condom usage habits of New Zealand's sex workers said that they offered various safe sex alternatives to vaginal sex to clients who refused to wear a condom. One sex worker said that mammary intercourse was one alternative used; mammary intercourse performed by a woman with large breasts felt to the client like penetrative vaginal sex.[7] 
Depictions of the practice, at least in advertising, have been described as pornographic or erotic.[8] Mammary intercourse has sometimes been considered a perversion.[9] Sigmund Freud, however, considered such extensions of sexual interest to fall within the range of the normal, unless marked out by exclusivity (i.e. the repudiation of all other forms of sexual contact).[10] 
One major source of controversy in the realm of sex education is whether LGBT sex education should be integrated into school curricula.[1] LGBT sex education includes inclusive teaching of safe sex practices for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals and general instruction in topics related to sexual orientation and gender identity. Studies have shown that many schools do not offer such education today.[2] Five states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas) have laws in place that ban teaching LGBT sex education. 
Only 20% of LGBT students have heard anything positive about their community and they reported in a 2011 Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) report that they were more likely to hear positive information about LGBT people from a history or social studies class rather than a health class.[136] 
Pro-LGBT 
Proponents of LGBT sex education argue that encompassing homosexuality into the curricula would provide LGBT students with the sexual health information they need,[137] and help to ameliorate problems such as low self-esteem and depression that research has shown can be present in LGBT individuals.[138] They also claim that it could reduce homophobic bullying.[138][139] 
An example of LGBT-inclusive curriculum is introduced by the National Sexuality Education Standards set forth by the Future of Sex Education Initiative. These education standards outline seven core topics that must be addressed in sex education; one of those core topics is identity. 
The identity topic presents lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identities as possibilities for students as they progress through life and come to understand who they are. These standards, the Future of Sex Education argues, will start in kindergarten and will evolve into more complex topics throughout schooling as the students mature and age.[140] In the UK, BigTalk Education's Growing Up Safe programme includes LGBT relationship education from Primary School age, was awarded the 2017 Pamela Sheridan award for innovation and good practice in relationships and sex education (RSE), services and projects for young people.[141]

Opponents often argue that teaching LGBT sex education would be disrespectful to some religions[22] and expose students to inappropriate topics.[135] They say that including homosexuality in the curriculum would violate parents’ rights to control what their children are exposed to and that schools should not inflict a particular political view on students.[142] Currently, many sex education curricula do not include LGBT topics, and research has reported that students often feel that they do not receive adequate instruction in LGBT sex topics.[135][143] 
Sex education, also known as sexual education, sexuality education or sex ed, is the instruction of issues relating to human sexuality, including emotional relations and responsibilities, human sexual anatomy, sexual activity, sexual reproduction, age of consent, reproductive health, reproductive rights, safe sex and birth control. Sex education which includes all of these issues is known as comprehensive sex education, and is often opposed to abstinence-only sex education, which only focuses on sexual abstinence. Sex education may be provided by parents or caregivers, or as part at school programs and public health campaigns. 
In many cultures, the discussion of all sexual issues has traditionally been considered taboo, and adolescents were not given any information on sexual matters. Such instruction, as was given, was traditionally left to a child's parents, and often this was put off until just before their marriage. However, in the late 19th century, the progressive education movement led to the introduction of sex education as "social hygiene" in North American school curricula and the introduction of school-based sex education.[1] 
Despite early inroads of school-based sex education, most of the information on sexual matters in the mid-20th century was obtained informally from friends and the media, and much of this information was deficient or of dubious value, especially during the period following puberty, when curiosity about sexual matters was the most acute. This deficiency was heightened by the increasing incidence of teenage pregnancies, particularly in Western countries after the 1960s. As part of each country's efforts to reduce such pregnancies, programs of sex education were introduced, initially over strong opposition from parent and religious groups. 
The outbreak of AIDS has given a new sense of urgency to sex education. 
In many African countries, where AIDS is at epidemic levels (see HIV/AIDS in Africa), sex education is seen by most scientists as a vital public health strategy.[2] Some international organizations such as Planned Parenthood consider that broad sex education programs have global benefits, such as controlling the risk of overpopulation and the advancement of women's rights (see also reproductive rights). The use of mass media campaigns has sometimes resulted in high levels of "awareness" coupled with essentially superficial knowledge of HIV transmission.[3] 
Kissa was a town of ancient Pontus on the Black Sea coast, on the road from Trapezus to Apsarus.[1] 
Its site is located near Hopa (Kise) in Asiatic Turkey.[1][2] 
Kissamos (Greek: Κίσσαμος) is a town and a municipality in the west of the island of Crete, Greece. It is part of the Chania regional unit and of the former Kissamos Province which covers the northwest corner of the island. The town of Kissamos is also known as Kastelli Kissamou and often known simply as Kastelli after the Venetian castle that was there. 
It is now a port and fishing harbour, with a regular ferry from the Peloponnese via Kythira. A town museum is located in the old Venetian governor's palace and there have been important archaeological finds in the town, including fine mosaics, dating from the Roman city of Kisamos (Κίσαμος, Latinized as Cisamus). The head town of the municipality (Δήμος Κισσάμου) is Kastelli-Kissamos itself. 
After the Venetian conquest of Crete in 1212, Kissamos became a Latin Church diocese. The names of more than 20 residential Latin bishops from then until the end of the 16th century are known, including :[9][10][11] 
The Latin residential bishopric of Latin: Cisamus (Curiate Italian Cisamo) was suppressed in around 1600, and only a titular bishopric remains.[12] 
The municipality has an area of 341.018 km2 (131.668 sq mi) and the municipal unit has an area of 149.034 km2 (57.542 sq mi).[14] The municipal unit of Kissamos includes the Gramvousa peninsula (Chernisos Gramvousas Χερσόνησος Γραμβούσας) in the northwest and the adjacent Gramvousa islets, as well as the islet of Pontikonisi, and the villages of Sfinari, Koukounaras, Polirinia, Platanos, Lousakia, Sirikari, Kallergiania and Kalathena. 
It forms the extreme western part of the Chania regional unit, and of Crete. It is bordered by Platanias to the East, and by Kantanos-Selino to the south. 
The province of Kissamos (Greek: Επαρχία Κισσάμου) was one of the provinces of the Chania Prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipality of Kissamos, and the municipal units of Kolymvari and Voukolies (partly).[15] It was abolished in 2006. 
Strabo said that ancient Cisamus was dependent on Aptera and was its naval arsenal.[2] The Peutinger Table distinguishes two port towns in Crete called Cisamus,[3] Modern Kissamos (at 35°29′38″N 23°39′25″E) is much further west than where Aptera is now placed (at 35°27′46″N 24°8′31″E). 
It was excluded already by Pashley in 1837 as being, of the two ancient maritime Cretan cities named Kisamos, the one associated with Aptera.[4] In the past, when the port of Aptera was thought to be present-day Kissamos, some supposed Aptera to be identical with Polyrrhenia, and Kissamos to be the port of Polyrrhenia.[5] However, Strabo and other ancient sources say that Polyrrhenia's port was at Phalasarna on the west coast.[6][7] 
In human beings, the sex of an individual is determined at the time of fertilization by the genetic material carried in the sperm cell. If a sperm cell carrying an X chromosome fertilizes the egg, the offspring will typically be female (XX). 
On the other hand, if a sperm cell carrying a Y chromosome fertilizes the egg, the offspring will typically be male (XY). The actual determining factor is the SRY gene, which is normally found on the Y chromosome. People with ambiguous genetic or physiological structure are referred to as intersex. 
Facial hair;[1] Chest hair;[12] Broadened shoulders;[13] An enlarged larynx (also known as an Adam's apple);[13] and A voice that is significantly deeper than the voice of a child or a woman.[10] 
The male reproductive system includes external and internal genitalia. The male external genitalia consist of the penis, the male urethra, and the scrotum, while the male internal genitalia consist of the testes, the prostate, the epididymis, the seminal vesicle, the vas deferens, the ejaculatory duct, and the bulbourethral gland.[14] 
The male reproductive system's function is to produce semen, which carries sperm and thus genetic information that can unite with an egg within a woman. Since sperm that enters a woman's uterus and then fallopian tubes goes on to fertilize an egg which develops into a fetus or child, the male reproductive system plays no necessary role during the gestation. The study of male reproduction and associated organs is called andrology. 
Although in general men suffer from many of the same illnesses as women, they suffer from slightly more illnesses in comparison to women. 
Men have lower life expectancy[15] and higher suicide rates[16] compared to women. 
Sexuality and gender 
Male sexuality and attraction vary from person to person, and a man's sexual behavior can be affected by many factors, including evolved predispositions, personality, upbringing, and culture. While the majority of men are heterosexual, significant minorities are homosexual or bisexual.[17] Some men identify as mostly straight.[18] 
A small percentage of people assigned female at birth may identify as male (typically referred to as transgender men). 
In contrast, some people assigned male at birth may identify as female (typically referred to as transgender woman). Some people assigned male at birth may also identify as non-binary.[19] There are also intersex people who may identify as either female or male. 
Masculinity (also sometimes called manhood or manliness) is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles associated with boys and men. 
Although masculinity is socially constructed,[20] some research indicates that some behaviors considered masculine are biologically influenced.[21] To what extent masculinity is biologically or socially influenced is subject to debate.[21] It is distinct from the definition of the biological male sex, as both males and females can exhibit masculine traits.[22] 
Standards of manliness or masculinity vary across different cultures and historical periods.[23] While the outward signs of masculinity look different in different cultures, there are some common aspects to its definition across cultures. In all cultures in the past, and still among traditional and non-Western cultures, getting married is the most common and definitive distinction between boyhood and manhood.[24] In the late 20th century, some qualities traditionally associated with marriage (such as the "triple Ps" of protecting, providing, and procreating) were still considered signs of having achieved manhood.[24][25] 
Anthropology has shown that masculinity itself has social status, just like wealth, race and social class. In Western culture, for example, greater masculinity usually brings greater social status. Many English words such as virtue and virile (from the Indo-European root vir meaning man) reflect this.[26][27] 
A man is an adult male human.[1][2] Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent). 
The Parsons model was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles. Model A describes total separation of male and female roles, while Model B describes the complete dissolution of barriers between gender roles.[28] 
The Mars Symbol (♂ ) is a common symbol that represents the male gender.[29] The symbol is identical to the planetary symbol of Mars.[30] It was first used to denote sex by Carl Linnaeus in 1751. 
The symbol is sometimes seen as a stylized representation of the shield and spear of the Roman god. Mars. According to Stearn, however, this derivation is "fanciful" and all the historical evidence favours "the conclusion of the French classical scholar Claude de Saumaise (Salmasius, 1588–1683)" that it is derived from θρ, the contraction of a Greek name for the planet Mars, which is Thouros.[31] 
Like most other male mammals, a man's genome usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father. The male fetus produces larger amounts of androgens and smaller amounts of estrogens than a female fetus. 
This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women. During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes. These include greater muscle mass, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition. 
Why males have nipples has been the subject of scientific research. Differences among the sexes (called sexual dimorphism) within a given species are considered by evolutionary biologists to be mostly the result of sexual selection, directly or indirectly. There is a consensus that the male nipple exists because there is no particular advantage to males losing the trait (this is called a spandrel).[10][11][12] 
Nipples can be sensitive to touch, and nipple stimulation can incite sexual arousal.[51] Few women report experiencing orgasm from nipple stimulation.[52][53] Before Komisaruk et al.'s functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) research on nipple stimulation in 2011, reports of women achieving orgasm from nipple stimulation relied solely on anecdotal evidence.[54] Komisaruk's study was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain; it indicates that sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina, clitoris and cervix, and that these reported orgasms are genital orgasms caused by nipple stimulation, and may be directly linked to the genital sensory cortex ("the genital area of the brain").[54][55][56] 
In mammals, a nipple (also called mammary papilla or teat) is a small projection of skin containing the outlets for 15–20 lactiferous ducts arranged cylindrically around the tip. 
Marsupials and eutherian mammals typically have an even number of nipples arranged bilaterally, from as few as 2 to as many as 19.[6] 
Some companies and non-profit organisations have used the word nipple or images of nipples to draw attention to their product or cause.[1][57] 
The skin of the nipple is rich in a supply of special nerves that are sensitive to certain stimuli: these are slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting cutaneous mechanoreceptors. Mechanoreceptors are identified respectively by Type I slowly-adapting with multiple Merkel corpuscle end-organs and Type II slowly-adapting with single Ruffini corpuscle end-organs, as well as Type I rapidly-adapting with multiple Meissner corpuscle end-organs and Type II rapidly-adapting with single Pacinian corpuscle end-organs. The dominant nerve supply to the nipple comes from the lateral cutaneous branches of fourth intercostal nerve.[7] The nipple is also used as an anatomical landmark. 
It marks the T4 (fourth thoracic vertebra) dermatome and rests over the approximate level of the diaphragm.[8] 
The arterial supply to the nipple and breast originates from the anterior intercostal branches of the internal thoracic (mammary) arteries; lateral thoracic artery; and thoracodorsal arteries. 
The venous vessels parallel the arteries.[2] The lymphatic ducts that drain the nipple are the same for the breast.[2] The axillary nodes are the apical axillary nodes, the lateral group and the anterior group.[9] 75% of the lymph is drained through the axillary lymph nodes located near the armpit. 
The rest of the drainage leaves the nipple and breast through infroclavicular, pectoral, or parasternal nodes. 
Oxytocin release from the nipple stimulation of the infant causes the uterus to contract even after childbirth.[13][14] The strong uterine contractions that are caused by the stimulation of the mother's nipples help the uterus contract to clamp down the uterine arteries. 
These contractions are necessary to prevent post-partum haemorrhage.[15] 
United States 
These time intervals would seem to be reversed; this is an area where public policy trumps science. The idea is that for women beyond age 35, every month counts and if made to wait another six months to prove the necessity of medical intervention, the problem could become worse. The corollary to this is that, by definition, failure to conceive in women under 35 isn't regarded with the same urgency as it is in those over 35. 
In the UK, previous NICE guidelines defined infertility as failure to conceive after regular unprotected sexual intercourse for two years in the absence of known reproductive pathology.[11] Updated NICE guidelines do not include a specific definition, but recommend that "A woman of reproductive age who has not conceived after 1 year of unprotected vaginal sexual intercourse, in the absence of any known cause of infertility, should be offered further clinical assessment and investigation along with her partner, with earlier referral to a specialist if the woman is over 36 years of age."[12] 
Primary infertility is defined as the absence of a live birth for women who desire a child and have been in a union for at least 12 months, during which they have not used any contraceptives.[14] The World Health Organisation also adds that 'women whose pregnancy spontaneously miscarries, or whose pregnancy results in a still born child, without ever having had a live birth would present with primarily infertility'.[14] 
Infertility is the inability of a person, animal or plant to reproduce by natural means. It is usually not the natural state of a healthy adult, except notably among certain eusocial species (mostly haplodiploid insects). 
It is however the healthy state of a human child or other young offspring, for they have not yet undergone puberty, the body's start of reproductive capacity. 
Male infertility is defined as the inability of a male to make a fertile female pregnant, for a minimum of at least one year of unprotected intercourse. There are multiple causes for male infertility. These include endocrine disorders (usually due to hypogonadism) at an estimated 2% to 5%), sperm transport disorders (such as vasectomy) at 5%, primary testicular defects (which includes abnormal sperm parameters without any identifiable cause) at 65% to 80% and idiopathic (where an infertile male has normal sperm and semen parameters) at 10% to 20%.[65] 
In some cases, both the man and woman may be infertile or sub-fertile, and the couple's infertility arises from the combination of these conditions. In other cases, the cause is suspected to be immunological or genetic; it may be that each partner is independently fertile but the couple cannot conceive together without assistance. 
If conservative medical treatments fail to achieve a full-term pregnancy, the physician or WHNP may suggest the patient undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF). IVF and related techniques (ICSI, ZIFT, GIFT) are called assisted reproductive technology (ART) techniques. 
Other medical techniques are e.g. tuboplasty, assisted hatching, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. 
IVF is the most commonly used ART. 
It has been proven useful in overcoming infertility conditions, such as blocked or damaged tubes, endometriosis, repeated IUI failure, unexplained infertility, poor ovarian reserve, poor or even nil sperm count. 
ICSI technique is used in case of poor semen quality, low sperm count or failed fertilization attempts during prior IVF cycles. This technique involves an injection of a single healthy sperm directly injected into mature egg. The fertilized embryo is then transferred to womb. 
Fertility tourism is the practice of traveling to another country for fertility treatments.[74] It may be regarded as a form of medical tourism. 
The main reasons for fertility tourism are legal regulation of the sought procedure in the home country, or lower price. In-vitro fertilization and donor insemination are major procedures involved. 
Nowadays, there are several treatments (still in experimentation) related to stem cell therapy. It is a new opportunity, not only for partners with lack of gametes, but also for same-sex couples and single people who want to have offspring. Theoretically, with this therapy, we can get artificial gametes in vitro. 
There are different studies for both women and men.[75] 
Spermatogonial stem cells transplant: it takes places in the seminiferous tubule. 
With this treatment, the patient experience spermatogenesis, and therefore, it has the chance to have offspring if he wants to. 
It is specially oriented for cancer patients, whose sperm is destroyed due to the gonadotoxic treatment they are submitted to.[76] Ovarian stem cells: it is thought that women have a finite number of follicles from the very beginning. 
Nevertheless, scientists have found these stem cells, which may generate new oocytes in postnatal conditions.[77] Apparently there are only 0.014% of them (this could be an explanation of why they were not discovered until now).[citation needed] There is still some controversy about their existence, but if the discoveries are true, this could be a new treatment for infertility. 
Stem cell therapy is really new, and everything is still under investigation. Additionally, it could be the future for the treatment of multiple diseases, including infertility. It will take time before these studies can be available for clinics and patients. 
As a measure, the fertility rate is the average number of children that a female has in her lifetime and is quantified demographically. Fertility is most commonly considered when there is a difficulty or an inability to reproduce naturally, and this is also referred to as infertility. Experiencing infertility is not discriminatory against any particular individual and the phenomenon is widely acknowledged, with fertility specialists available all over the world to provide expertise for assisting mothers and couples who experience difficulties having a baby. 
Fertility differs from fecundity, which is defined as the potential for reproduction (influenced by gamete production, fertilization and carrying a pregnancy to term).[1] Where a woman or the lack of fertility is infertility while a lack of fecundity would be called sterility. 
Uyajola 9/9 is a South African reality television show playing on Moja Love channel 157 weekly. It is a hidden camera reality television series about people who suspect their partners of infidelity. The series premiered on 26 May 2019.[1] The show is hosted by Jub Jub and Moss Makwati who are also co producers of the show. 
The name Uyajola 9/9 is derived from a street word meaning "you are having an affair". 
9/9 is a Tsotsitaal word loosely meaning "for real", so Uyajola 9/9 would then mean "You are having an affair for real". 
It airs on Sunday evenings with 30 minute episodes played back-to-back on Moja Love 157. The show starts with the host sitting at the headquarters and reads a letter from the complainant then goes out to visit the complainant to hear the story face to face, then asks to be given some time to investigate a case of infidelity thoroughly. After thorough investigation, the complainant is presented with evidence and the suspect is confronted. 
Uyajola 9/9 has been accused of using black pain[clarification needed] for ratings.[1] Many viewers signed a petition to have the show cancelled[2] after it was alleged by the Daily Sun that some stories were scripted and that people were paid to be on the first episode of the show under false pretence.[3] This did not pass as the show still airs and the channel responded on Twitter and on radio,[4] saying that stories were real.[5] 
Tsotsitaal has been a model for Iscamtho, due to the cultural prestige of Sophiatown. But the youth abandoned it in the 1970s, when Afrikaans came to be no more associated with the power of the state, as it had been so far, but was recognized as the language of apartheid and oppression (especially after the 1976 Soweto Uprising). Iscamtho then became the one youth language in Soweto. 
Also, the taste of Tsotsitaal-speakers for word transformation, language-mixing and word creation has been transmitted to Iscamtho speakers. Thus, linguistic creativity is the main characteristic of the speakers of the Sowetan language. And although it has different varieties, Iscamtho carries a single identity for all of its speakers, who recognize it as one variety, whatever form it takes. 
This is due to the way the language operates: from one grammar which serves as a matrix, the speaker adds words from other languages (including English, Afrikaans, and different Bantu languages) or typically Iscamtho words. One can also create words by modifying existing ones or by coining completely new terms. Thus, Iscamtho and other tsotsitaals experience continuous evolution. 
Due to the popularity of Soweto among Black South African youth, and due also to the importance of Soweto-based artists in the foremost post-apartheid culture, kwaito, Iscamtho has been spreading to other township youths in the country, and different tsotsitaals have been enriched with typically Iscamtho material. Thus a form of "standardization" of tsotsitaals around the norm of Iscamtho might be on its way. This is largely the consequence of the presence of Iscamtho on the radio (through music but also because many national radios are based in Soweto and Johannesburg), on television (in series and entertainment shows) and in the kwaito culture. 
For male speakers however, the language quickly acquired a meaning of city-slickness and street-wisdom, and mastering it was the proof that one knew the urban environment well enough to cope and not be threatened. However, as Tsotsitaal became the symbol of the cultural life of Sophiatown (before the area was cleared of its residents in the mid-1950s) it was adopted by a number of women. But only the most independent and self-affirmed women would then become Tsotsitaal-speakers. 
Due to the importance of gangsterism in Soweto over about four decades and due to the large numbers of Sowetan youths who experienced prison for criminal or political activities in the last two decades of apartheid, the status of Iscamtho changed: from a street language, it became the main language of most youths, started to be spoken within households among the youths, and then between the youths and adults. In the course of the 1980s for the latest, Iscamtho reached the status of mother language for thousands of Sowetan youths, meaning that children learnt Iscamtho in the cradle from their parents along with their family's other languages. Today, the distinction between Iscamtho and urban Zulu or urban Sotho in Soweto tends to be thinner as hundreds of thousands of youths actually speak Iscamtho as a first language. 
In addition, a post-apartheid evolution has been the adoption of Iscamtho and other tsotsitaals by many female speakers. Especially, many girls in deep Soweto now have Iscamtho as (one of) their native language(s). Iscamtho as a symbol of youth, city-slickness and the multilingualism of the South African democracy (each language is represented in Iscamtho) has become a language proper for both male and female speakers despite some remaining conservative behaviours and considerations towards female speakers. 
Especially among the younger lesbian community. Iscamtho is often used as a strong identity marker, and many young lesbians appreciate it and use it as their main language. 
Iscamtho has also become a language used in exchanges with older people, who previously would have been offended to be addressed to in the tsotsi language. But as native speakers of Iscamtho refuse to be discriminated against, they often impose their language in exchanges, and consider it as respectful as any other. 
Tsotsitaal is a vernacular derived from a variety of mixed languages mainly spoken in the townships of Gauteng province (such as Soweto), but also in other agglomerations all over South Africa. Tsotsi is a Sesotho, Pedi or Tswana slang word for a "thug" or "robber" or "criminal", possibly from the verb "ho lotsa" "to sharpen", whose meaning has been modified in modern times to include "to con"; or from the tsetse fly, as the language was first known[by whom?] as Flytaal, although flaai also means "cool" or "street smart". The word taal in Afrikaans means "language". 
However, the language is more than a mere slang, and is referred to by its speakers as "our language". With the advent of rising middle-class and elite Blacks in South Africa after apartheid and the significance of gold to the South African history and culture, the attitudes prevalent in kwaito music appropriate gold to notions of success and wealth. Because of their urban nature and form, tsotsitaals came to be emblematic of the attitudes of post-apartheid South African black poor youth that were largely apolitical, concerned mainly with a representation of success and wealth. 
Today, kwaito music using tsotsitaal and more especially Iscamtho can be heard on national radio stations such as YFM (for Youth FM). Some prominent artists such as Zola7 speak Iscamtho when they appear in the media (Zola7 especially has its own regular TV show). Iscamtho is also used in advertisement, for all products which aim at the youths. 
Finally, Iscamtho has spread on television, through youth programs such as series (especially Yizo Yizo), soapies (Rhythm City or Generations) and entertainment shows. From 2007, a local television station opened in Orlando West, Soweto. 
Called SowetoTV, this station uses Iscamtho as one of its main languages, together with English, Zulu and Sotho. 
A number of programs for the youths are in Iscamtho only, such as Dlalangeringas (which means “Let's speak Iscamtho”). 
Nowadays in Soweto, possibly up to 500,000 youths speak Iscamtho as their main language or one of their main languages. Some of them have learnt it from birth, and master Iscamtho better than any other language. As the South African Constitution provides for everyone to be educated in his/her native language, linguistic problems in the educational system are an important issue in Soweto: children considered by the authorities as being Zulu- or Sotho-speakers are educated in those languages. 
South African citizens have the right to be tried in their language, but dispositions are only provided for the 11 official languages of the country. As a consequence, first-language Iscamtho-speakers face inequalities compared to the rest of the population, as they might be tried in a language which is not the one they master best. On the contrary, when trying to use “their” language at court, they rarely have the opportunity to be supported by a translator who can understand this language, as translators are recruited for their competence in one or more of the 11 official languages. 
More often than not, when celebrated in the media capacity or space, tsotsi taal speakers are presented in a manner in which the older generations of such a culture would be described; fairly violent, conniving and restless. This kind of media portrayal usually spreads the logic; like all marginalized and unofficial languages; that there is not or cannot be a voice of reason, intelligence, love or even respect among its speakers. This then, may just be the reason as to why the language is being unrecognized by many communities and institutions. 
There is however a very distinct level of respect accompanied by the language that many may not understand. When a fellow tsotsi taal speaker sees and meets another; a very profound sense of respect and belonging can be witnessed. The term "ka" followed by what the western world would normally call a fist bump was traditionally a shortened versioned term for "kasi" meaning township - a proud expression indicating where one was from - the townships.[4] 
A tsotsitaal is built over the grammar of one or several languages, in which terms from other languages or specific terms created by the community of speakers are added. It is a permanent work of language-mix, language-switch, and terms-coining. 
The tsotsitaal phenomenon originates with one variety known as Flaaitaal or Flytaal, and then Tsotsitaal, which became popular under this latter name in the freehold township of Sophiatown, west of Johannesburg, in the 1940s and 1950s. 
Tsotsitaal, the original variety, is based on Afrikaans, in which were originally added Tswana terms, and later terms from Zulu and other South African languages. Tsotsitaal spread first as a criminal language, as it had the power of insuring secrecy in the speech: only criminals at first could understand it. 
Later, as a prestigious sign of rebellion against the state and its police, and as gangsters were admired by youths who would see in them examples of success, Tsotsitaal became a youth and street language. At the time, it would exceptionally be heard in households, as tradition did not allow a gangster language to be used in the house. But it quickly became a symbol of the ethnically, culturally, and linguistically mixed culture of Sophiatown. 
From the original Tsotsitaal, the noun tsotsitaal came to refer to any gang or street language in South Africa. However, the specific variety behind the term would depend on the languages actually present in the specific urban environment were one tsotsitaal appears. The most important tsotsitaal nowadays in South Africa is the one from the township of Soweto, the largest township and the place which shows the most diverse linguistic setting in the country. 
It was originally known as Iscamtho or Isicamtho[dubious ] (from Zulu, it is a combination of the class 7 prefix isi- here representing language — see grammatical gender and Sesotho nouns; with a derivation of ukuqamunda [uk’u!amunda], meaning “talk volubly”), but it is now more often referred to as Ringas (from English ringers, as people form a ring to chat). Other alternative names are Isitsoti or Setsotsi (the tsotsi language in Zulu or Sotho), Sekasi (the township language, from the Iscamtho word kasi meaning township, itself derived from Afrikaans lokasie), or simply i-taal, the language. 
However, Iscamtho is quite different from the original Tsotsitaal. It originates in a different criminal argot created in the 1920s by the AmaLaita gang and known as Shalambombo. 
It is not based on Afrikaans, but on Bantu grammars, mainly Zulu and Sotho. The Zulu-based and Sotho-based varieties are the most widespread in Soweto, but one can actually build Iscamtho over any grammar of the South African Bantu languages, such as Xhosa, Tsonga, Tswana, Venda and others. But as Zulu is the dominant language in Soweto, and as Sotho in Soweto often unifies Sesotho, Setswana and Sepedi in one single variety and is the second most popular language in the township, Iscamtho is more often used "in" Zulu or "in" Sotho. 
Molemo Katleho Maarohanye (known professionally as Jub Jub; born 29 June 1980)[citation needed] is a South African Media Personality who is a successful hip hop artist [1]and TV Host of popular shows such as Uyajola 9/9, You Promised to Marry Me and Uthando Noxolo which air on Mojalove DSTV Channel 157. Jub Jub is a child star who was discovered in 1991 when he partook in a popular Coca Cola Tv advertisement that featured soccer legend Doctor Khumalo. [2] He went on to present multiple TV shows such as Jam Alley, Channel O and Selimathunzi amongst many. 
Before he was convicted of culpable homicide for the death of four children in December 2012, he was one of the highest selling rappers in South Africa having achieved platinum status for his albums “Rare Breed” and “My Shine”. He is the son of controversial businesswoman Jackie Maarohanye. Jub Jub currently hosts the reality show, Uyajola 9/9which focuses on exposing cheating partners and spouses. 
Following his release from prison in January 2017, Jub Jub vowed to turn his life around.[1] Shortly after his release, the musician released a song called "Ke Kopa Tshwarelo" (Please forgive me).[4] As of 2019, he has made several TV appearances and is currently the host of the Moja Love reality show, Uyajola 9/9.[4] 
On 8 March 2010[5] he and his friend Themba Tshabalala caused a serious accident when they were drag racing under the influence of hard drugs on a public road near a school.[6] Four children were killed and another two survived with brain damage.[6] On 5 December 2012, both were sentenced to 25 years in jail each for murder, attempted murder and three related offences.[5] An appeal was heard on 7 February 2014.[5] On 8 October 2014 Jub Jub and Tshabalala's murder conviction was overturned to culpable homicide in a high court in Johannesburg.[7] Their sentences were reduced from 25 years to 10 years, starting from 2012. 
On 5 January 2017 he was released on parole after serving 4 years, one month and one day of his sentence; Tshabalala was also released on parole the same day.[8] 
In 2016, in an interview with MTV Base, Jub Jub's ex-girlfriend, fellow South African artist Kelly Khumalo accused Jub Jub of physically abusing her.[4] Khumalo claimed that during Jub Jub's 2010 arrest for a drag racing incident, she was "dealing with a partner who [was] going through a very serious case, who was also very abusive, emotionally and physically".[4] Jub Jub has denied the accusations. 
Khumalo revealed in June 2019 she does not allow Jub Jub to see his son.[4] 
The show was created by Bobby Goldstein, an attorney in Dallas, Texas. It made its debut in 2000. 
The original host of the show was actor Tommy Habeeb aka "Tommy Grand" (2000–2002). 2004 brought syndication reruns of previous seasons, edited into a half-hour Monday-through-Friday strip format with new intros by Joey Greco as host. When Cheaters began airing in high-definition, the show's title card, used for eleven seasons, was altered to 3D, and more high-definition graphics were incorporated into the show. 
Cheaters airs on Saturday nights on The CW Plus. It also aired on G4TV from 2006 to 2012. 
The CW Plus airs two episodes: a one-hour-long episode followed by a 30-minute episode. A 10-minute version of the show called Cheaters: Amazing Confrontations is available through on-demand services. 
In 2006, G4 began showing the strip version with faster-paced editing and music due to complaints that the show seemed boring and contrived,[citation needed] as well as a different narrator, for weekly airings on its Midnight Spank block.[5] On December 9, 2009, G4 moved this show to the short-lived "Junk Food TV" block. 
G4 stopped airing the show December 2012. 
In 2002, the Houston Press tracked down several people who said they were paid $400 per show by one of the detectives of the agency to act on the show, and were paid $50 per referral of other actors.[6] One performer said, "What [the show's private detective] told me was that some of the episodes are real, but... they would do these ringer episodes to supplement the show." The show's private investigator denies that he staged anyone's scenario and further added that the number of inquiries the agency receives made this unnecessary.[7] The producers of Cheaters currently reiterate the reality of each episode in a legalistic message at its end, though a Federal Communications Commission representative confirmed to the Houston Press that "there's no law or regulation against presenting acted-out scenarios as reality on television."[8][9][10] [11] 
Visual Entertainment of Canada has released several best-of collections of Cheaters on DVD in Region 1.[15] In addition the Cheaters Spy Shop was launched in September 2011 to sell items used on the show and has been promoted in episodes beginning in the Season 12.[16] Cheaters DVD releases are uncensored, with language and sexual content (including occasional views of acts such as fellatio and penetration) shown unfiltered. 
In the song, Need It, released in 2020 as the lead single to Migos' fourth studio album, Culture III, Offset from the Atlanta trio sings during the chorus: "Then I leave her, I can not get caught up, I can not be on Cheaters". Referencing his past, Offset seeks to avoid an appearance on Cheaters.[17] 
In the song, "Hats Off" by Lil Baby & Lil Durk (off their collaborative project, The Voice of the Heroes, released in 2021), featured artist on the track, Travis Scott, raps during his verse: "Sorry, gotta f--k on the low, I can't make Cheaters."[18] Similar to Offset, Travis Scott is looking to avoid appearing on Cheaters. Travis Scott was accused of cheating during his high-profile relationship with model/socialite and businesswoman Kylie Jenner.[19][20] 
Cheaters is a weekly syndicated reality television series featuring couples with one partner who is committing adultery, or cheating, on the other partner. Investigations are headed by the "Cheaters Detective Agency".[1] It began airing in 2000, and as of December 2020, it has aired 21 seasons. It has been hosted by Tommy Habeeb, Joey Greco, Clark James Gable, and currently, it is being hosted by Peter Gunz. 
Actor Joey Greco was the show's longest-running host, hosting from late 2002 to mid-2012 and returning in 2019. At the onset of the show's 13th season, he was replaced by Clark James Gable, the grandson of legendary actor Clark Gable. He would host the series until his untimely passing in 2019 due to a drug overdose. 
In February 2020, it was announced via social media that Love & Hip Hop star Peter Gunz would become the new host beginning in October 2020 (Season 21). Filming of season 21 took place in Dallas during the summer of 2020, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.[2][3] 
Moses (Greek: Μωϋσῆς),[NB 1] Moishe (Yiddish: משה‎),[NB 2] Moshe (Hebrew: משה‎),[NB 3] or Movses (Armenian: Մովսես) [NB 4] is a male given name, after the biblical figure Moses. 
According to the Torah, the name "Moses" comes from the Hebrew verb, meaning "to pull out/draw out" [of water], and the infant Moses was given this name by Pharaoh's daughter after she rescued him from the Nile (Exodus 2:10)[1] Since the rise of Egyptology and decipherment of hieroglyphs, it was postulated that the name of Moses, with a similar pronunciation as the Hebrew Moshe, is the Egyptian word for Son, with Pharaoh names such as Thutmose and Ramesses roughly translating to "son of Thoth" and "son of Ra," respectively.[2] 
Jews named with the Hebrew name of Moses, commonly held a similar name in the language of the countries where they were born or lived. 
In Europe they were named Maurici, Maurice, Morris, Mauricio. In Arabic speaking countries, along with Moussa - the Arabic name for Moses, they were also named Mustafa.[3]

RTL Klub was the only licensed broadcaster of Formula One in Hungary from 2002 until 2011. After 10 years RTL decided not to renew the licence for Formula 1. The reason was that they wanted to concentrate mainly for the prime time programs because of the shrinking advertising market.[1] 
RTL Klub is a Hungarian free-to-air television channel (M-RTL Zrt.) and it owned by RTL Group. 
It was one of Hungary's first commercial TV channels and began broadcasting only three days after its main rival TV2. 
This movie channel was devoted partly to female audiences, and partly to family films during the evenings and weekends. It offered comedies, romantic films, adventures and dramas. In the RTL cable portfolio, Film+ 2 was the channel that broadcasts most Hungarian films. 
Since its start, RTL Klub has focused to gain viewers from the urban population. The channel airs programs mostly for a younger (18-49) audience. 
It launched as Poén! on 2 April 2008, then it was renamed as Prizma on 20 December 2010. Prizma's focus was on entertainment and its purpose was to provide something attractive for each generation. Most of its programming consisted of beloved familiars, but there were some new audience favourites, too. 
It airs as RTL+ since 1 May 2014. 
Sorozat+ is the channel for fans of series - for those who live in anticipation of the next episode. Sorozat+ offers something for each member of the family, from Latin-American telenovelas to top US series. It launched on 2 April 2008. 
While TV2 purchased the rights of Big Brother, RTL Klub produced its own series called Való Világ (Real World). Való Világ had three seasons between 2002 and 2004. Since its second season the show has been much more successful than the rival Big Brother. 
RTL Klub is the most watched TV channel in Hungary since 2002, thanks to the daily Hungarian soap opera Barátok közt (Among Friends), which is the most watched TV programme in Hungary with more than 2 million viewers; the tabloid magazine Fókusz (Focus) and the game show Legyen Ön is milliomos (Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?). Millionaire is off the schedule from September 2007 after seven years and has replaced by A Széf (Take It Or Leave It). 
The next year Prison Break started with almost 1.6 million. Nowadays a TV show at prime time (21:00) can reach 1-1.5 million viewers. In season 2006-2007 Prison Break was the most watched American series in Hungary. 
Poker Face ran like a tournament for six weeks with an average 38-42% share. The other new show was Csillag születik, the Hungarian version of the RTL Got Talent format. Poker Face ended with the super final at 18 December and the time slot of it will be occupied by the new game show A Széf (Take It or Leave it). 
The Mzansi Account is a low income transactional banking account that was developed in line with the commitments of South Africa's Financial Sector Charter. The Financial Sector Charter requires banks to make banking more accessible to the nation and, specifically, to increase banking reach to all communities. 
The Mzansi Account is the result of the major South African banks working collectively to provide a standard for new bank accounts, which is affordable, readily available and suits the specific needs of the previously unbanked communities. Each bank has established its own pricing competitively. 
In general, communities only use a single measure of value, which can be identified in the prices of goods listed for sale. There might be multiple media of exchange, which can be observed by what is given to purchase goods ("medium of exchange"), etc.. In most countries, the government acts to encourage a particular forms of money, such as requiring it for taxes and punishing fraud. 
Some places do maintain two or currencies, particularly in border towns or high-travel areas. 
Shops in these locations might list prices and accept payment in multiple currencies. Otherwise, foreign currency is treated as an financial asset in the local market. Foreign currency is commonly bought or sold on foreign exchange markets by travelers and traders. 
Communities can change the money they use, which is known as currency substitution. This can happen intentionally, when a government issues a new currency. 
For example, when Brazil moved from the Brazilian cruzeiro to the Brazilian real. It can also happen spontaneously, when the people refuse to accept a currency experiencing hyperinflation (even if its use is encouraged by the government). 
To fulfill its various functions, money must have certain properties:[28] 
Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic context.[1][2][3] The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment.[4][5] Any item or verifiable record that fulfils these functions can be considered as money. 
Bank money, or broad money (M1/M2) is the money created by private banks through the recording of loans as deposits of borrowing clients, with partial support indicated by the cash ratio. Currently, bank money is created as electronic money. 
In most countries, the majority of money is mostly created as M1/M2 by commercial banks making loans. Contrary to some popular misconceptions, banks do not act simply as intermediaries, lending out deposits that savers place with them, and do not depend on central bank money (M0) to create new loans and deposits.[29] 
"Market liquidity" describes how easily an item can be traded for another item, or into the common currency within an economy. Money is the most liquid asset because it is universally recognized and accepted as a common currency. In this way, money gives consumers the freedom to trade goods and services easily without having to barter. 
Liquid financial instruments are easily tradable and have low transaction costs. There should be no (or minimal) spread between the prices to buy and sell the instrument being used as money. 
In 1875, the British economist William Stanley Jevons described the money used at the time as "representative money". Representative money is money that consists of token coins, paper money or other physical tokens such as certificates, that can be reliably exchanged for a fixed quantity of a commodity such as gold or silver. 
The value of representative money stands in direct and fixed relation to the commodity that backs it, while not itself being composed of that commodity.[33] 
Fiat money or fiat currency is money whose value is not derived from any intrinsic value or guarantee that it can be converted into a valuable commodity (such as gold). Instead, it has value only by government order (fiat). Usually, the government declares the fiat currency (typically notes and coins from a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve System in the U.S.) to be legal tender, making it unlawful not to accept the fiat currency as a means of repayment for all debts, public and private.[34][35] 
Some bullion coins such as the Australian Gold Nugget and American Eagle are legal tender, however, they trade based on the market price of the metal content as a commodity, rather than their legal tender face value (which is usually only a small fraction of their bullion value).[32][36] 
Fiat money, if physically represented in the form of currency (paper or coins), can be accidentally damaged or destroyed. However, fiat money has an advantage over representative or commodity money, in that the same laws that created the money can also define rules for its replacement in case of damage or destruction. 
For example, the U.S. government will replace mutilated Federal Reserve Notes (U.S. fiat money) if at least half of the physical note can be reconstructed, or if it can be otherwise proven to have been destroyed.[37] By contrast, commodity money that has been lost or destroyed cannot be recovered. 
Coinage 
These factors led to the shift of the store of value being the metal itself: at first silver, then both silver and gold, and at one point there was bronze as well. Now we have copper coins and other non-precious metals as coins. Metals were mined, weighed, and stamped into coins. 
This was to assure the individual taking the coin that he was getting a certain known weight of precious metal. Coins could be counterfeited, but they also created a new unit of account, which helped lead to banking. Archimedes' principle provided the next link: coins could now be easily tested for their fine weight of the metal, and thus the value of a coin could be determined, even if it had been shaved, debased or otherwise tampered with (see Numismatics). 
M-Net Movies is a group of South Africa-based film-only television channels launched as Movie Magic in 1995 and broadcast across Sub-Saharan Africa on pay TV satellite services DStv and GOtv. The channels broadcast films/movies based on genre as well as clips featuring behind-the-scenes looks at previous, current and future breakout box office hit films. 
M-Net Movies flagship channel consisting of first run movie premieres mostly after being available on the DStv BoxOffice rental service, as well as animation specials. The channel is a result of M- Net Movies Premiere and M-Net Movies Smile (Smile being a combination of M-Net Movies Comedy and M-Net Movies Family). 
The premium action movie channel focuses on thrillers and horror movies. It is a combination of M-Net Movies Action and M-Net Movies Action+. 
This is a general entertainment channel focusing on the most favoured stars, inherited from its predecessors M-Net Movies Action & M-Net Movies Allstars. Due to most stars being voiceovers, the channel has mostly animated films/movies, with a mix of comedy and romance and some action. 
The pop-up channel and the first of the movie channels to broadcast less than 24 hours a day. 
Initially, the channel was named M-Net Movies Showcase. In 2015, the same year M-Net Movies Smile was formed, another channel, M-Net Movies Romance was incorporated into Showcase, in direct response to viewer complaints of too many repeats. Mostly airing movie festivals such as Star Wars, Harry Potter, James Bond, etc. 
This channel is usually available to DStv Premium and this January, the channel wasn't launched for Premium, it was launched for Compact and Compact+. M-Net Movies also has an Add Movies feature that allows non-premium subscribers to watch premium movie channels for a fee which includes future pop-up channels that may launch on M-Net Movies. 
MultiChoice through M-Net launched two M-Net film/movie channels, Movie Magic 1 and Movie Magic 2 a day after the launch of its pay television satellite service DStv. In order to unify/expand the M-Net brand, the channels were renamed respectively M-Net Movies 1 and M-Net Movies 2 in 2005.[1] Two additional film channels, M-Net Stars and M-Net Movies Action (which on launch replaced M-Net Action (then actionX) which launched in 2006), were later launched. In October 2012, the previous film channels were expanded to six channels which grouped films according to genre.[2] These channels, along with the existing Action, Stars and Zone, made for a total of nine movie channels. 
In June M-Net Movies Action was made an HD channel, followed by M-Net Movies All Stars, both only in Southern Africa, in October 2016. 
As of 1 September 2020, M-Net stopped giving their movie channels names and went with the numbering system and reduced the number of movie channels from 6 to 4 channels. M-Net Movies also has an Add Movies feature which allows non-premium subscribers to pay for premium movie channels including future pop-up channels.[3] 
A seventh channel M-Net Movies Showcase was later dropped by M-Net on 1 April 2017 with the aim of creating limited run pop-up channels, airing films ranging from those starring Tom Cruise, Sylvester Stallone and Will Smith. On 1 June 2017 it was replaced by Sundance TV. On 1 December 2017, M-Net Movies Zone was made available in HD to all households who owned an HD capable decoder such as the DStv Explora, HD Decoder, HD PVR and were on the all DStv packages. 
As of 1 September 2020, M-Net Movies stopped giving their movie channels names and reverted to adding numbers to the channels alongside reducing the number of movie channels to four. From now, there are 4 Movie channels, numbers, qualities and packages. 
Zee World is an English-Bollywood channel in South Africa which launched on 3 February 2015 and is exclusive to the DStv service. It carries domestic programming from India dubbed from Hindi and Marathi into English. The channel is owned by Zee Entertainment Enterprises and has offices in Johannesburg. 
There are a variety of non-penetrative sex practices. Frot is a form of male-male sexual activity that usually involves direct penis-to-penis contact.[18] It is a form of frottage. 
Frot can be enjoyable because it mutually and simultaneously stimulates the genitals of both partners as it tends to produce pleasurable friction against the frenulum nerve bundle on the underside of each man's penile shaft, just below the urinary opening (meatus) of the penis head (glans penis). Intercrural sex is another form of non-penetrative sex that can be practiced between MSM. Docking (the insertion of one man's penis into another man's foreskin) is also practiced. 
MSM may use sex toys. 
According to an online survey of 25,294 men who self-reported a homosexual or bisexual orientation, 49.8% have used vibrators. Most men who had used a vibrator in the past reported use during masturbation (86.2%). When used during partnered interactions, vibrators were incorporated into foreplay (65.9%) and intercourse (59.4%).[19] 
MSM may engage in different forms of oral sex, such as fellatio, tea bagging, and anilingus. Wellings et al. reported that "the equation of 'homosexual' with 'anal' sex among men is common among lay and health professionals alike," whereas an online survey of 18,000 MSM in Europe "showed that oral sex was most commonly practised, followed by mutual masturbation, with anal intercourse in third place."[1] A 2011 survey by The Journal of Sexual Medicine found similar results for U.S. gay and bisexual men. 
Kissing a partner on the mouth (74.5%), oral sex (72.7%), and partnered masturbation (68.4%) were the three most common behaviors, with 63.2% of the sample self-reporting five to nine different sexual behaviors during their last encounter.[20] 
A variety of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can result from sexual activity. A 2007 study reported that two large population surveys found "the majority of gay men had similar numbers of unprotected sexual partners annually as straight men and women."[21][22] 
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease of the human immune system caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).[23][24][25] Worldwide, an estimated 5–10% of HIV infections are the result of men having sex with men.[26] However, in most of the Western world, more HIV infections are transmitted by men having sex with men than by any other transmission route.[27] In the United States, gay and bisexual men accounted for 70% of 38,739 new HIV diagnoses in 2017.[28] Of the 5,164 people diagnosed with HIV in the UK in 2016, 54% were gay or bisexual men.[29] This statistic is decreasing in London as reported by Public Health England in 2017.[30][31] 
Gay sexual practices are sexual activities involving men who have sex with men (MSM), regardless of their sexual orientation or sexual identity. These practices can include anal sex, non-penetrative sex, and oral sex. Evidence shows that sex between men is significantly underreported in surveys due to social desirability bias.[1][2] 
Syphilis is passed from person to person through direct contact with a syphilis sore; mainly on the external genitals, the vagina, or anus.[32] In 2006, 64% of the reported cases in the United States were among men who have sex with men.[32] A rise in the incidence of syphilis among MSM has been seen in other developed nations. 
Contracting syphilis increases the rates of HIV contamination and vice versa, and accordingly a survey in the US has indeed found that half MSM with syphilis also possess HIV.[33] Some studies utilizing convenience samples have concluded that such rise can be attributed to increased rates of sex without a condom among MSM,[34] though at least one study using a nationally representative sample has found that condom use rates among MSM have increased, not decreased, in the last decade, and there has been a steep decline in the frequency of anal sex in the last sexual encounter of active MSM.[35] 
According to a US survey, HIV, syphilis, and anal warts are all significantly more common among men who recently had sex with men (MSM) than among men who recently had sex only with women (MSW). On the other hand, genital herpes is less common among MSM than among MSW. Chlamydia, human papillomavirus, gonorrhea, and lice saw no significant difference across the two groups.[36] 
Bisexuality Homosexuality Male homosexuality 
Historically, anal sex has been popularly associated with male homosexuality and MSM. 
Many MSM, however, do not engage in anal sex, and may engage in oral sex, frottage or frot, or mutual masturbation instead.[3][4][5] 
Reports pertaining to the prevalence of anal sex among MSM have varied over time, with some percentages higher than others.[6][12][13][14] A large percentage of gay and bisexual men self-report lifetime participation in anal sex.[6] Studies among gay men have indicated that percentages are similar when comparing men who prefer to penetrate their partners to those who prefer to be the receptive partner.[6][15] Some men who have sex with men, however, believe that being a receptive partner during anal sex questions their masculinity.[16][17] 
An orgasm includes involuntary actions, including muscular spasms in multiple areas of the body, a general euphoric sensation and, frequently, body movements and vocalizations.[7] The period after orgasm, known as a refractory period, is often a relaxing experience, attributed to the release of the neurohormones oxytocin and prolactin.[7][8] Although it is generally reported that women do not experience a refractory period and can thus experience an additional orgasm (or multiple orgasms) soon after the first one,[7][9] some sources state that women are capable of experiencing a refractory period because they may experience a moment after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement.[8][10] 
Oral stimulation of the clitoris or other parts of vulva or the vagina is commonly practiced between women and, like oral stimulation of the nipples, can include the use of teeth in addition to use of the lips or tongue.[11][12] Oral sex that involves the stimulation of the woman's clitoris or other parts of the vulva or the vagina is called cunnilingus. The oral stimulation of the anus, called anilingus, is less often practiced.[12][13] 
Lesbian sexual practices are sexual activities involving women who have sex with women, regardless of their sexual orientation. A woman who has sex with another woman may identify as a lesbian if she is sexually attracted to women, or bisexual if she is not exclusively sexually attracted to women, or dispense with sexual identification altogether. 
The term may also be applied to a heterosexual or asexual woman who is unsure of or is exploring her sexuality. 
Romantic or sexual interpersonal relationships are often subject to sexual desire and arousal, which then leads to sexual activity for sexual release. A physical expression of intimacy between women depends on the context of the relationship along with social, cultural and other influences.[1] 
Commonly, women engage in displays of affection, such as kissing on the cheek or hugging. A kiss on the lips, a prolonged kiss or hug, or other forms of touching, may or may not be regarded as sexual. Sex educator and feminist Shere Hite stated that one of her female research subjects had written, "Sex with a woman includes: touching, kissing, smiling, looking serious, embracing, talking, digital intercourse, caressing, looking, cunnilingus, undressing, remembering later, making sounds, sometimes gently biting, sometimes crying, and breathing and sighing together."[2] 
Disrobing before a partner, removing the clothing of a partner or performing acts of physical intimacy, such as the touching of a partner's erogenous zones by the use of hands, tongue or rest of the mouth, may be regarded as indicators of the partner's desire for sexual activity and an erotic stimulus or turn-on (sexual arousal), which may generate erotic sensations in both partners. Allowing such acts of physical intimacy, especially the stimulation of a partner's breasts and nipples, is an indication of reciprocal interest in sexual activity. 
A woman's mouth, lips and tongue may be sensitive erogenous zones; they are commonly used by partners during the preliminary stages and throughout a sexual activity, whether for kissing, sucking, licking or specifically for oral sex. The stimulation of a partner's breasts, including oral or manual stimulation of the nipples, is a form of foreplay. 
Breast and nipple stimulation of women is a common aspect of sexual activity.[3] The stimulation of a woman's nipples promotes the production and release of oxytocin and prolactin.[4] During the stimulation of the nipples, large amounts of oxytocin are released, which would normally prepare the breast for breastfeeding. Besides creating maternal feelings in a woman, it also decreases her anxiety and increases bonding and trust.[5][6] 
Isibaya was a South African daily drama series[1] that started production in 2013, premiering on Mzansi Magic and created by Angus Gibson, Desiree Markgraaff, Teboho Mahlatsi and Catherine Stewart.

Nqobile Mansuet Ntuli (born 15 January 1996) is a South African field hockey player who plays as a forward for the South African national team.[1] 
Ntuli was a part of the South African squad which won the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, which meant they qualified for the 2018 World Cup.[2] He represented South Africa at the 2018 Commonwealth Games.[1] In October 2018 he was selected in the South Africa squad for the 2018 World Cup.[3] 
Nqobile Nzuza was a resident in the Marikana Land Occupation in Cato Crest, Durban, South Africa. She was a member of the shackdwellers' social movement Abahlali baseMjondolo.[1] 
Nkululeko Gwala Political repression in post-apartheid South Africa Protests in South Africa 
On 30 September 2013, at the age of 17 years, Ms. Nzuza was shot dead in the back of her head during an anti-eviction protest organised by Marikana residents.[2][3] 
Police admitted to shooting Nzuza, and another resident who was wounded, but claimed they were acting in self-defence. Representatives of Abahlali baseMjondolo said it was the fault of the police.[4] 
The death caused significant controversy. 
When Bandile Mdlalose visited Nzuza's family, she was arrested.[5] There were a range of letters and statements on the matter by well-known US based academics such as Noam Chomsky[6] and Anglican Bishop Rubin Phillip.[7] 
Chomsky wrote a letter to the Mail & Guardian newspaper in Johannesburg along with other signatories, which included Slavoj Zizek, Judith Butler and John Holloway. They urged Jacob Zuma, President of South Africa and James Nxumalo, the local Mayor to put an end to the violent attacks on activists and their homes.[1] 
Nkululeko Gwala (died 2013) originally from Inchanga in KwaZulu Natal, was a resident of Cato Crest in Durban and a supporter of the Marikana Land Occupation (Durban). He was also a prominent member of the shackdwellers' social movement Abahlali baseMjondolo.[1][2]

Gwala was assassinated on June 26 2013 after unnamed gunmen opened fire and he was shot 12 times.[3] This was following a controversial community meeting with eThekwini Mayor James Nxumalo and ANC regional chairperson Sibongeseni Dhlomo in which Mr Gwala was singled out as a trouble maker.[4][5] [6] Abahlali baseMjondolo claims that Dhlomo also announced at the meeting that Mr Gwala would be "sorted out".[7] 
The movement says Nkululeko Gwala was assassinated for exposing corruption in Cato Crest and that the community knows the identity of the gunman who they say also killed housing activist Thembinkosi Qumbelo. They claim the gunmen are associated with a local ANC councillor.[8][9] 
Muslims believe the Quran to be God's final revelation to humanity, a work of divine guidance revealed to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel.[1][69] 
Revered by pious Muslims as "the holy of holies,"[70] whose sound moves some to "tears and ecstasy",[71] it is the physical symbol of the faith, the text often used as a charm on occasions of birth, death, marriage.[citation needed] Consequently, 
Traditionally great emphasis was put on children memorizing the 6200+ verses of the Quran, those succeeding being honored with the title Hafiz. "Millions and millions" of Muslims "refer to the Koran daily to explain their actions and to justify their aspirations,"[lower-roman 13] and in recent years many consider it the source of scientific knowledge.[74][75] 
Revelation in Islamic and Quranic contexts means the act of God addressing an individual, conveying a message for a greater number of recipients. The process by which the divine message comes to the heart of a messenger of God is tanzil (to send down) or nuzūl (to come down). As the Quran says, "With the truth we (God) have sent it down and with the truth it has come down."[76] 
The Quran frequently asserts in its text that it is divinely ordained. Some verses in the Quran seem to imply that even those who do not speak Arabic would understand the Quran if it were recited to them.[77] The Quran refers to a written pre-text, "the preserved tablet," that records God's speech even before it was sent down.[78][79] 
Muslims believe that the present wording of the Quran corresponds to that revealed to Muhammad, and according to their interpretation of Quran 15:9, it is protected from corruption ("Indeed, it is We who sent down the Quran and indeed, We will be its guardian.").[80] Muslims consider the Quran to be a guide, a sign of the prophethood of Muhammad and the truth of the religion. 
The Shīa believe that the Quran was gathered and compiled by Muhammad during his lifetime, rather than being compiled by Uthman ibn Affan. There are other differences in the way Shias interpret the text.[81] Muslims do not agree over whether the Quran was created by God or is eternal and "uncreated." Sunnis (who make up about 85-90% of Muslims) hold that the Quran is uncreated—a doctrine that has been unchallenged among them for many centuries. 
Shia Twelvers and Zaydi, and the Kharijites—believe the Quran was created.[82] Sufi philosophers view the question as artificial or wrongly framed.[83][need quotation to verify] 
The first surah of the Quran is repeated in daily prayers and on other occasions. This surah, which consists of seven verses, is the most often recited surah of the Quran:[1] 
Respect for the written text of the Quran is an important element of religious faith by many Muslims, and the Quran is treated with reverence. Based on tradition and a literal interpretation of Quran 56:79 ("none shall touch but those who are clean"), some Muslims believe that they must perform a ritual cleansing with water (Wudu or Ghusl) before touching a copy of the Quran, although this view is not universal.[1] Worn-out copies of the Quran are wrapped in a cloth and stored indefinitely in a safe place, buried in a mosque or a Muslim cemetery, or burned and the ashes buried or scattered over water.[86] 
In Islam, most intellectual disciplines, including Islamic theology, philosophy, mysticism and jurisprudence, have been concerned with the Quran or have their foundation in its teachings.[1] Muslims believe that the preaching or reading of the Quran is rewarded with divine rewards variously called ajr, thawab, or hasanat.[87] 
The Quran also inspired Islamic arts and specifically the so-called Quranic arts of calligraphy and illumination.[1] The Quran is never decorated with figurative images, but many Qurans have been highly decorated with decorative patterns in the margins of the page, or between the lines or at the start of suras. Islamic verses appear in many other media, on buildings and on objects of all sizes, such as mosque lamps, metal work, pottery and single pages of calligraphy for muraqqas or albums. 
According to the Quran, God communicated with man and made his will known through signs and revelations. Prophets, or 'Messengers of God', received revelations and delivered them to humanity. The message has been identical and for all humankind. 
"Nothing is said to you that was not said to the messengers before you, that your lord has at his Command forgiveness as well as a most Grievous Penalty."[104] The revelation does not come directly from God to the prophets. Angels acting as God's messengers deliver the divine revelation to them. This comes out in Quran 42:51, in which it is stated: "It is not for any mortal that God should speak to them, except by revelation, or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger to reveal by his permission whatsoever He will."[2][103] 
The astrophysicist Nidhal Guessoum, while being highly critical of pseudo-scientific claims made about the Quran, has highlighted the encouragement for sciences that the Quran provides by developing "the concept of knowledge." 
He writes:[108]: 174 
The Qur'an draws attention to the danger of conjecturing without evidence (And follow not that of which you have not the (certain) knowledge of... 17:36) and in several different verses asks Muslims to require proofs (Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful 2:111), both in matters of theological belief and in natural science. 
In Sunni Islam, the shahada has two parts: la ilaha illa'llah (there is no god but Allah), and Muhammadun rasul Allah (Muhammad is the messenger of God),[78] which are sometimes referred to as the first shahada and the second shahada.[79] The first statement of the shahada is also known as the tahlīl.[80] 
The word muslim (Arabic: مسلم‎, IPA: [ˈmʊslɪm]; English: /ˈmʌzlɪm/, /ˈmʊzlɪm/, /ˈmʊslɪm/ or moslem /ˈmɒzləm/, /ˈmɒsləm/[84]) is the active participle of the same verb of which islām is a verbal noun, based on the triliteral S-L-M "to be whole, intact".[85][86] A female adherent is a muslima (Arabic: مسلمة‎) (also transliterated as "Muslimah"[87] ). 
The plural form in Arabic is muslimūn (مسلمون) or muslimīn (مسلمين), and its feminine equivalent is muslimāt (مسلمات). 
The ordinary word in English is "Muslim". 
The word Mosalman (Persian: مسلمان‎, alternatively Mussalman) is a common equivalent for Muslim used in Central and South Asia. In English it was sometimes spelled Mussulman and has become archaic in usage. 
Until at least the mid-1960s, many English-language writers used the term Mohammedans or Mahometans.[88] Although such terms were not necessarily intended to be pejorative, Muslims argue that the terms are offensive because they allegedly imply that Muslims worship Muhammad rather than God.[89] Other obsolete terms include Muslimite[90] and Muslimist.[91] 
It is stated in a hadith from Imam Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha that the Prophet of Islam said: "God created 124 thousand prophets, of whom I am dearer to God, at the same time I do not boast (and I do not show pride) and God created 124 thousand wills, of which Ali is more esteemed and superior to God than all of them."[citation needed] The Qur'an describes many prophets and messengers within Judaism and Christianity, and their respective followers, as Muslim: Adam, Noah, Abraham, Ishmael, Jacob, Moses, and Jesus and his apostles are all considered to be Muslims in the Qur'an. The Qur'an states that these men were Muslims because they submitted to God, preached His message and upheld His values, which included praying, charity, fasting and pilgrimage. Thus, in Surah 3:52 of the Qur'an, Jesus' disciples tell him, "We believe in God; and you be our witness that we are Muslims (wa-shahad be anna muslimūn)." 
The most populous Muslim-majority country is Indonesia, home to 12.7% of the world's Muslims,[93] followed by Pakistan (11.0%), Bangladesh (9.2%), Nigeria (5.3%) and Egypt (4.9%).[61] About 20% of the world's Muslims live in the Middle East and North Africa.[93][94] 
Sizable minorities are also found in India, China, Ethiopia, the Americas, Australia and parts of Europe. The country with the highest proportion of self-described Muslims as a proportion of its total population is Morocco.[95] 
Over 75–90% of Muslims are Sunni.[20][21] The second and third largest sects, Shia and Ahmadiyya, make up 10–20%,[22][23] and 1%[24] respectively. 
With about 1.8 billion followers (2019), almost a quarter of earth's population,[96] Islam is the second-largest and the fastest-growing religion in the world.[97] due primarily to the young age and high fertility rate of Muslims,[98] with Muslim having a rate of (3.1) compared to the world average of (2.5). According to the same study, religious switching has no impact on Muslim population, since the number of people who embrace Islam and those who leave Islam are roughly equal.[98] 
A Pew Center study in 2016 found that Muslims have the highest number of adherents under the age of 15 (34% of the total Muslim population) of any major religion, while only 7% are aged 60+ (the smallest percentage of any major religion). According to the same study, Muslims have the highest fertility rates (3.1) of any major religious group.[99] The study also found that Muslims (tied with Hindus) have the lowest average levels of education with an average of 5.6 years of schooling, though both groups have made the largest gains in educational attainment in recent decades among major religions.[99] About 36% of all Muslims have no formal schooling,[99] and Muslims have the lowest average levels of higher education of any major religious group, with only 8% having graduate and post-graduate degrees.[99] 
Muslim culture or Islamic culture are terms used to describe the cultural practices common to Muslims and historically Islamic people. The early forms of Muslim culture, from the Rashidun Caliphate to early Umayyad period, were predominantly Arab, Byzantine, Persian and Levantine. With the rapid expansion of the Islamic empires, Muslim culture has influenced and assimilated much from the Persian, Egyptian, Caucasian, Turkic, Mongol, South Asian, Malay, Somali, Berber, Indonesian, and Moro cultures. 
Muslims (Arabic: مسلم‎, romanized: Muslim) are people who follow or practice Islam, an Abrahamic monotheistic religion. 
The derivation of "Muslim" is from an Arabic word meaning "submitter (to God)".[34] Muslims consider the Quran, their holy book, to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet and messenger Muhammad. The majority of Muslims also follow their own versions of compilations claimed to be the teachings and practices of Muhammad (sunnah) as recorded in traditional accounts (hadith).[35] 
As of 2015, 1.8 billion or about 24.1% of the world population are Muslims.[39] By the percentage of the total population in a region considering themselves Muslim, 91% in the Middle East–North Africa (MENA),[40] 81% in Central Asia,[41][42] 65% in the Caucasus,[43][44][45][46][47][48] 40% in Southeast Asia,[49][50] 31% in South Asia,[51][52] 30% in Sub-Saharan Africa,[53] 25% in Asia and Oceania collectively,[54] around 6% in Europe,[55] and 1% in the Americas.[56][57][58][59] 
Most Muslims are of one of two denominations; Sunni (75–90%)[60] and Shia (12-17%).[22] About 12% of Muslims live in Indonesia, the largest Muslim-majority country;[61][62] 31% of Muslims live in South Asia,[63] the largest population of Muslims in the world;[64] 20% in the Middle East–North Africa,[65] where it is the dominant religion;[66] and 15% in Sub-Saharan Africa.[67] Muslims are the overwhelming majority in Central Asia,[68] the majority in the Caucasus[11][12] and widespread in Southeast Asia.[13] India is the country with the largest Muslim population outside Muslim-majority countries.[69] Sizeable Muslim communities are also found in the Americas, China, and Europe.[70][71][72] Islam is the fastest-growing major religion in the world.[73][74][75] 
To become a Muslim and to convert to Islam, it is essential to utter the Shahada, one of the Five Pillars of Islam, a declaration of faith and trust that professes that there is only one God (Allah) and that Muhammad is God's messenger.[76] It is a set statement normally recited in Arabic: ašhadu ʾal-lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāhu wa ʾašhadu ʾanna muħammadan rasūlu-llāh (أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله وأشهد أن محمداً رسول الله) "I testify that there is no god [worthy of worship] except Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah."[77] 
In Christianity the figures widely recognised as prophets are those mentioned as such in the Old Testament and the New Testament. It is believed that prophets are chosen and called by God. 
The main list below consists of only those individuals that have been clearly defined as prophets, either by explicit statement or strong contextual implication, (e.g. the purported authors of the books listed as the major prophets and minor prophets) along with the Biblical reference to their office. 
The second list consists of those individuals who are recorded as having had a visionary or prophetic experience, but without a history of any major or consistent prophetic calling. The third list consists of unnamed prophets. The fourth list contains the names of those described in the Bible as prophets, but are presented as either misusing this gift or as fraudulent. 
The last two lists relate to claimed post-Biblical individuals followed by some (but not all) Christians. The final list consists of post-Biblical individuals regarded as prophets and of post-Biblical individuals who are claimed to have had visionary or prophetic experience. 
Aaron Ahijah Book of Kings 1 Kings 11.29 Amos (One of the 12 Minor Prophets) Agabus (Acts of the Apostles 11:27–28) Azariah (2 Chronicles 15:1–8) 
This category is for people considered prophets in Christianity, but not Judaism. People considered prophets in Judaism and Christianity are found in the subcategory Category:Prophets of the Hebrew Bible. 
Ann Bathurst was a prophet and member of the 17th century English dissenter group, the Philadelphian Society. 
Not much is known of Bathurst's family, and what is known is due to her two-volume manuscript diary covering the period 1679 to 1696. 
This diary is held at the Bodleian Library, Oxford.[1] It appears that Bathurst came from a religious background, and her diary begins with an autobiographical account that describes family prayer and Bible reading. 
By 1697, the Philadelphians met at Bathurst's house in Baldwin Gardens, London every Sunday, where she lived with Joanna Openbridge. This group are known to have held millennialist views, and Bathurst produced prophetic visions that resulted in a 'lyrical, woman-inclusive representation of mystical theology'.[2] She was considered as a possible successor to Jane Leade who led the group until her death in 1704. This was prevented by Bathurst's own death at around the same time. 
In April 1652, Hatfield became ill with a type of catalepsy. She became paralyzed, blind, deaf and mute. This lasted for seventeen days. 
When she recovered she began "rambling" about religious subjects and started quoting scriptures. What she said was documented by John and Peter, the songs of Edward Rodes, and another man named John Cromwell. On 8 September 1652 she became mute again. 
She remained mute until 7 December 1652. However, her second recovery did not have any prophetic moments.[3] 
In 1653, her uncle,[4] James Fisher, who founded the first Presbyterian church in Sheffield, England, wrote a book about Hatfield and her prophetic dialogue called The Wise Virgin. The book was a best seller and was reprinted multiple times.[2] 
Jarlath appears briefly as a prominent figure in the medieval Irish Lives of St Brendan of Clonfert.[10] Brendan is said to have visited Connacht to study under the famous Jarlath. 
One day, when Jarlath was in his old age, Brendan advised his mentor to leave the school and to depart in a newly built chariot until its two hind shafts broke, because there would be the place of his resurrection (esséirge) and that of many after him. Because Jarlath acknowledged the divinity and superior wisdom of his pupil, saying "take me into thy service for ever and ever", he gladly accepted his advice. His travel did not take him very far, as the shafts broke at Tuaim da Ghualann ("Mound of two shoulders"), that is, at Tuam.[2][3] 
John Colgan drew up a memoir of the saint in his Acta Sanctorum Hiberniae (1645). Jarlath is said to have studied under St Benignus at Kilbennen, disciple of St Patrick. 
Afterwards, he founded his first monastery at Cluainfois (Cloonfush), near Tuam, while his principal seat came to be at Tuam. His monastic school is said to have attracted scholars from all parts of Ireland, including such students as St Brendan of Ardfert and Saint Colman of Cloyne. On the significance of the place-name Tuam, Dónall Mac Giolla Easpaig posits: 
"[t]he first element in the placename Tuaim Dá Ualann/Ghualann referred to a pagan burial-ground similar to that designated by the second element of Cluain Fearta (see Clonfert). If so Tuam offers another example of an early church being built on or near a pre-Christian sacred site."[1] 
Despite his fame, Jarlath left Cloonfush to study under Saint Enda of Aran around 495.[12] In the 520s, he retired to Tuam. He chose Tuam because the wheel of his chariot broke there. Jarlath is included in the second order of Irish saints, which implies that he must have lived prior to the year 540.[12] 
A poem ascribed to Cuimmín of Coindeire, which is also cited in Ó Cléirigh's Martyrology of Donegal, states that Jarlath was known for his generosity and devotion to prayer ("three hundred genuflexions every night, and three hundred genuflexions every day").[5][13] In the Martyrology of Donegal, he is credited with having predicted the names of his successors, including those of three 'heretical' bishops and one Máel.[5] Similarly, his hagiography in the "Great Synaxaristes of the Orthodox Church" records that as a result of his great asceticism and devotion to prayer he was granted the gift of prophecy.[2] 
Saint Jarlath's feast day is 6 June, which is the date of the translation of his relics to a church specially built in his honour next to the Cathedral of Tuam.[2] His remains were encased in a silver shrine, from which the 13th-century church gained the name Teampul na scrín, that is the "church of the shrine", a perpetual vicarage united to the prebend of Kilmainemore in 1415.[2] In a note added to the Félire Óengusso and in other martyrologies, Jarlath's feast-day was recorded as 25 or 26 December.[3][4][14] 
The first St Jarlath's Festival in Tuam, organised by the Energise Tuam community group, was organised for Saturday 7 June 2008. This included a pageant/parade from Tuam Cathedral through the streets of the town, a school's art competition to raise awareness of the saint and local cultural heritage, and street entertainment.[15] 
St Jarlath Road, a residential street in Cabra in Dublin 7 is named in his honour.[16] 
A parish in Oakland, California in the United States and one in Yarragon, Australia are named after him.[17][18] 
Saint Jarlath,[needs IPA] also known as Iarlaithe mac Loga (fl. 6th century), was an Irish priest and scholar from Connacht, remembered as the founder of the monastic School of Tuam and of the Archdiocese of Tuam,[3] of which he is the patron saint. No medieval Life for Jarlath is extant, but sources for his life and cult include genealogies, martyrologies, the Irish Lives of St Brendan of Clonfert, and a biography compiled by John Colgan in the 17th century. 
Jarlath of Tuam is said to have belonged to the Conmhaícne, who ruled over the greater part of what would become the parish of Tuam.[1][2] The other saint is said to have belonged to the Dál Fiatach in east Ulster.[4] He is identified as the third Bishop of Armagh, that is after Patrick's heir Benignus and the Annals of Ulster and Innisfallen record his death in the year 481.[4][6] 
Because of great risk and uncertainty, medical professionals are generally skeptical of penile enlargement and avoid attempting it.[1][12] A 2019 study in Sexual Medicine Reviews found that surgical methods of penis enlargement are typically ineffective and can be damaging to both physical and mental health.[13] The authors found that such treatments are "'supported by scant, low-quality evidence... 
Injectables and surgery should remain a last option, considered unethical outside of clinical trials'".[14] According to the study, "'overall treatment outcomes were poor, with low satisfaction rates and significant risk of major complications, including penile deformity, shortening, and erectile dysfunction'".[13] 
Penis-enlargement pills, patches, and ointments are sold online. Such products are generally considered ineffective.[16] 
Physical techniques involve extension devices, hanging weights, and vacuum pressure. There is also significant overlap between techniques intended to enlarge the penis and techniques intended to achieve other, related objectives, such as reversing impotence, extending the duration of erections, or enhancing sexual climax. 
Commonly called a "penis pump", a vacuum erection device, or VED, creates negative pressure that expands and thereby draws blood into the penis.[17][18] Medically approved VEDs, which treat erectile dysfunction, limit maximum pressure, whereas the pumps commonly bought by consumers seeking penis enlargement can reach dangerous pressure, damaging penis tissue.[19] To retain tumescence after breaking the device's airtight seal, one must constrict the penis' base, but constriction worn over 30 minutes can permanently damage the penis and cause erectile dysfunction.[20] Although vacuum therapy can treat erectile dysfunction sufficiently to prevent penis deterioration and shrinkage,[18] clinical trials have not found it effective for penis enlargement.[21][22] 
Jelqing 
The latinized name "jelqing" is the corrupt form derived from the Persian jalq zadan (جلق زدن), jalq meaning "to masturbate" followed by an auxiliary verb zadan meaning "to strike, hit or throb". Performed on the halfway tumescent penis, jelqing is a manual manipulation of simultaneous squeezing and stroking the shaft from base to corona. 
Also called "milking",[23] the technique has ancient Arab origins.[24] Despite many anecdotal reports of success, medical evidence is absent.[25] Journalists have dismissed the method as biologically implausible,[26] or even impossible, albeit unlikely to seriously damage the penis.[27] Still, if done excessively or harshly, jelqing could conceivably cause ruptures, scarring, disfigurement, and desensitization.[25][26] 
Penis enlargement, or male enhancement, is any technique aimed to increase the size of a human penis. Some methods aim to increase total length, others the shaft's girth, and yet others the glans size. Techniques include surgery, supplements, ointments, patches, and physical methods like pumping, jelqing, and traction. 
Traction is a nonsurgical method to lengthen the penis by employing devices that pull at the glans of the penis for extended periods of time. As of 2013, the majority of research investigating the use of penile traction focuses on treating the curvature and shrinkage of the penis as a result of Peyronie's disease, although some literature exists on the effects on men with short penises.[28] 
Scientific evidence supports some elongation by prolonged traction.[1] However, there are also medical studies that indicate that the lengthening effects can be negligible.[29] 
Some men seeking penis enlargement have normal-sized penises, and many may experience penile dysmorphophobia by underestimating their own penis size while overestimating the average penis size.[1] Other men may want a larger penis to enhance their sex lives, even if their penis is average or above average in size already. 
Individuals may desire to enlarge their penis size if they have a fetish for large penises. A larger penis may also play into BDSM and S&M, with a dominant male intentionally having a large penis to inflict pain upon his partner during sexual intercourse. 
In 2013 in Vietnam, many Vietnamese men attempted to enlarge their penises by injecting liquid silicone into them. They were hospitalized for complications such as infections, necrosis, tumors, swelling, deformities, and sexual dysfunction.[30] 
Surgical penis enlargement methods can be effective; however, such methods carry risks of complications and are not medically indicated except in cases involving a micropenis. Noninvasive methods have received little scientific study, and most lack scientific evidence of effectiveness. 
However, limited scientific evidence supports some elongation by prolonged traction.[1] Some quack products may improve penis erection, mistaken by consumers for penis enlargement. 
Penis reduction Peyronie's disease Plastic surgery Tissue expansion 
There are several surgical penis enlargement treatments, most of which carry a risk of significant complications.[2] Procedures by unlicensed surgeons can lead to serious complications.[3] 
Surgical penis enlargement methods include penile augmentation and suspensory ligament release. Penile augmentation involves injecting fat cells into the penis or grafting fat cells onto the penis. 
Injecting fat cells into the penis can cause swelling and deformity; in some instances, removal of the penis may be necessary. Grafting fat cells onto the penis can be effective; however, the increase in size may disappear over time. Suspensory ligament release increases flaccid penis length, but does not increase the length of an erect penis[4] and can create problems with sexual function.[5] 
The American Urological Association (AUA) and the Urology Care Foundation "consider subcutaneous fat injection for increasing penile girth to be a procedure which has not been shown to be safe or efficacious. The AUA also considers the division of the suspensory ligament of the penis for increasing penile length in adults to be a procedure which has not been shown to be safe or efficacious."[6] Both statements were first published in January 1994 and re-affirmed ever since.[6] Complications from penis enlargement procedures include scarring that may lead, ultimately, to penis shrinkage or erectile dysfunction.[7][8] 
Other surgical treatments include the injection of dermal fillers, silicone gel, or PMMA.[9][10] Dermal fillers are also not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the penis.[11] 
Many religions have expressed positions on what is acceptable to consume as a means of intoxication for spiritual, pleasure, or medicinal purposes. Psychoactive substances may also play a significant part in the development of religion and religious views as well as in rituals.[1][2][3][4][5] 
In the Vedas, the same word soma is used for the drink, the plant, and its deity. 
Drinking soma produces immortality (Amrita, Rigveda 8.48.3). Indra and Agni are portrayed as consuming soma in copious quantities. 
In the vedic mythology, Indra drank large amounts of soma while fighting the serpent demon Vritra. The consumption of soma by human beings is well attested in Vedic ritual. 
In the book Inside the Neolithic Mind, the authors, archaeologists David Lewis-Williams and David Pearce argue that hallucinogenic drugs formed the basis of neolithic religion and rock art. Similar practices and images are found in some contemporary "stone-age" indigenous peoples in South America using yaje. 
In Buddhism the Right View (samyag-dṛṣṭi / sammā-diṭṭhi) can also be translated as "right perspective", "right outlook" or "right understanding", is the right way of looking at life, nature, and the world as they really are for us. It is to understand how our reality works. 
It acts as the reasoning with which someone starts practicing the path. It explains the reasons for our human existence, suffering, sickness, aging, death, the existence of greed, hatred, and delusion. Right view gives direction and efficacy to the other seven path factors. 
It begins with concepts and propositional knowledge, but through the practice of right concentration, it gradually becomes transmuted into wisdom, which can eradicate the fetters of the mind. An understanding of right view will inspire the person to lead a virtuous life in line with right view. In the Pāli and Chinese canons, it is explained thus:[13][14][15][16][17] 
Right livelihood (samyag-ājīva / sammā-ājīva). This means that practitioners ought not to engage in trades or occupations which, either directly or indirectly, result in harm for other living beings. In the Chinese and Pali Canon, it is explained thus:[1][2] 
The five types of businesses that should not be undertaken:[20][21][22] 
According to the fifth precept of the Pancasila, Buddhists are meant to refrain from any quantity of "fermented or distilled beverages" which would prevent mindfulness or cause heedlessness.[23] In the Pali Tipitaka the precept is explicitly concerned with alcoholic beverages: 
"I undertake the training rule to abstain from fermented drink that causes heedlessness." 
Generally speaking, the vast majority of Buddhists and Buddhist sects denounce and have historically frowned upon the use of any intoxicants by an individual who has taken the five precepts. Most Buddhists view the use and abuse of intoxicants to be a hindrance in the development of an enlightened mind. However, there are a few historical and doctrinal exceptions. 
Many modern Buddhist schools have strongly discouraged the use of psychoactive drugs of any kind; however, they may not be prohibited in all circumstances in all traditions. Some denominations of tantric or esoteric Buddhism especially exemplify the latter, often with the principle skillful means: 
For example, as part of the ganachakra tsok ritual (as well as Homa, abhisheka and sometimes drubchen) some Tibetan Buddhists and Bönpos have been known to ingest small amounts of grain alcohol (called amrit or amrita) as an offering. If a member is an alcoholic, or for some other reason does not wish to partake in the drinking of the alcoholic offering, then he or she may dip a finger in the alcohol and then flick it three times as part of the ceremony. 
Amrita is also possibly the same as, or at least in some sense a conceptual derivative of the ancient Hindu soma. (The latter which historians often equate with Amanita muscaria or other Amanita psychoactive fungi.) 
Crowley (1996) states: 
"Undoubtedly, the striking parallels between "The legend about Chakdor" and the Hindu legend of the origin of soma show that the Buddhist amrita and the Hindu soma were at one time understood to be identical. Moreover, the principal property of amrita is, to this day, perceived by Buddhists as being a species of inebriation, however symbolically this inebriation may be interpreted. Why else would beer (Tibetan chhang, "barley beer") be used by yogins as a symbolic substitute for amrita [Ardussi]? 
Conversely, why else would the term bDud.rTsi be used as a poetic synonym for beer? 
Some scholars have suggested that Ancient Greek mystery religions employed entheogens, such as the Kykeon central to the Eleusinian Mysteries, to induce a trance or dream state.[6] Research conducted by John R. Hale, Jelle Zeilinga de Boer, Jeffrey P. Chanton and Henry A. Spiller suggests that the prophecies of the Delphic Oracle were uttered by Priestesses under the influence of gaseous vapors exuded from the ground.[7] Their findings are published in Questioning the Delphic Oracle: Overview / An Intoxicating Tale. 
The monk thought to himself, "well, surely if I kill the goat then I will be causing great suffering since a living being will die. If I sleep with the woman then I will have broken another great vow of a monk and will surely be lost to the ways of the world. 
Lastly, if I drink the beer then perhaps no great harm will come and I will only be intoxicated for a while, and most importantly I will only be hurting myself." 
(In the context of the story this instance is of particular importance to him because monks in the Mahayana and Vajrayana try to bring all sentient beings to enlightenment as part of their goal.) 
So the monk drank the mug of beer and then he became very drunk. In his drunkenness he proceeded to kill the goat and sleep with the woman, breaking all three vows and, at least in his eyes, doing much harm in the world. The lesson of this story is meant to be that, at least according to the cultures from which it delineates, alcohol causes one to break all of one's vows, in a sense that one could say it is the cause of all other harmful deeds.[24] 
The Vajrayana teacher Drupon Thinley Ningpo Rinpoche has said that as part of the five precepts which a layperson takes upon taking refuge, that although they must refrain from taking intoxicants, they may drink enough so as they do not become drunk. Bhikkus and Bhikkunis (monks and nuns, respectively), on the other hand, who have taken the ten vows as part of taking refuge and becoming ordained, cannot imbibe any amount of alcohol or other drugs, other than pharmaceuticals taken as medicine. 
There is some evidence regarding the use of deliriant Datura seeds (known as candabija) in Dharmic rituals associated with many tantras – namely the Vajramahabhairava, Samputa, Mahakala, Guhyasamaja, Tara and Krsnayamari tantras – as well as cannabis and other entheogens in minority Vajrayana sanghas.[25] Ronald M Davidson says that in Indian Vajrayana, Datura was: 
A book titled Zig Zag Zen: Buddhism and Psychedelics (2002), details the history of Buddhism and the use of psychedelic drugs, and includes essays by modern Buddhist teachers on the topic. 
Zen Buddhism is known for stressing the precepts. 
In Japan, however, where Zen flourished historically, there are a number of examples of misconduct on the part of monks and laypeople alike. This often involved the use of alcohol, as sake drinking has and continues to be a well known aspect of Japanese culture. 
Archaeological, ethnohistorical, and ethnographic data show that Mesoamerican cultures used psychedelic substances in therapeutic and religious rituals.[8] The ancient Aztecs used a variety of entheogenic plants and animals within their society, including ololiuqui (Rivea corymbosa), teonanácatl (Psilocybe spp.), and peyotl (Lophophora williamsii).[9] Goals for the usage of entheogenics by the Maya were spiritual healing, wisdom gain, and religious ceremonies. The effects of psychedelic plants during religious rituals is believed to have had an impact on the development and creation of statues, and sacred images.[10] 
Hinduism has a history of psychedelic usage going back to the Vedic period. The oldest scriptures of Hinduism Rigveda(1500 BCE), mentions ritualistic consumption of a divine psychedelic known as soma. There are many theories about the recipe of Soma. 
Non-Indian researchers have proposed candidates including Amanita muscaria, Psilocybe cubensis, Peganum harmala and Ephedra sinica. According to recent philological and archaeological studies, and in addition, direct preparation instructions confirm in the Rig Vedic Hymns (Vedic period) Ancient Soma most likely consisted of Poppy, Phaedra/Ephedra (plant) and Cannabis.[11][better source needed] 
Mufudza has been an off-spinner since he took up the game at Mbizi Primary School in Highfield, Harare. He played for the Takashinga Cricket Club in Harare before being recruited by Mountaineers.[1] 
He played his first matches for Mountaineers in 2011-12, and established himself in the side in 2012-13, when he took 13 wickets at an average of 14.92 to lead the national first-class bowling averages.[2] In the Logan Cup match against Southern Rocks he scored 39 batting at number 10, then took 2 for 46 and 5 for 27 in a 116-run victory.[3] In the Zimbabwean T20 competition final against Mashonaland Eagles he opened the bowling and took 4 for 14. Mountaineers won the match and he won the man of the match award.[4] 
He played for Cookham Dean in the Thames Valley Cricket League in 2014, taking 80 wickets at an average of 14.86 and making 499 runs at 27.72.[5] 
In the Logan Cup in December 2014 he took 7 for 31 in the second innings against Mid West Rhinos, including the first six wickets to fall, to ensure victory for Mountaineers.[6] In January 2015 he played two 50-over matches for Zimbabwe A against Canada, taking two wickets for 56 runs in 20 overs.[7] Later that month, opening the bowling in a List A match against Mashonaland Eagles, he took 4 for 28.[8] 
In December 2020, he was selected to play for the Eagles in the 2020–21 Logan Cup.[9][10] In April 2021, Mufudza was named in Zimbabwe's squad for their Twenty20 International (T20I) series against Pakistan.[11] 
Tapiwa Marobela (born 30 April 1987) is a former Botswana female tennis player. 
Marobela before she attended Florida State University from 2004 to 2008.[1] 
In contemporary Persian texts, no distinction is made between "city" and "town"; both translate as "Shahr" (شهر). In older Persian texts (until the first half of the 20th century), the Arabic word "Qasabeh" (قصبه) was used for a town. However, in recent 50 years, this word has become obsolete. 
In Latvia, towns and cities are indiscriminately called pilsēta in singular form. The name is a contraction of two Latvian words: pils (castle) and sēta (fence), making it very obvious what is meant by the word – what is situated between the castle and the castle fence. However, a city can be called lielpilsēta in reference to its size. 
In Lithuanian, a city is called miestas, a town is called miestelis (literally "small miestas). Metropolis is called didmiestis (literally "big miestas). 
In New Zealand, a town is a built-up area that is not large enough to be considered a city. Historically, this definition corresponded to a population of between approximately 1,000 and 20,000. Towns have no independent legal existence, being administered simply as built-up parts of districts, or, in some cases, of cities. 
New Zealand's towns vary greatly in size and importance, ranging from small rural service centres to significant regional centres such as Blenheim and Taupo. Typically, once a town reaches a population of somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 people, it will begin to be informally regarded as a city. One who regards a settlement as too small to be a town will typically call it a "township" or "village." 
In Norway, "city" and "town" both translate to "by", even if a city may be referred to as "storby" ("large town"). They will all be part of and administered as a "kommune" ("municipality"). 
In the Philippines, the local official equivalent of the town is the municipality (Filipino bayan). 
Every municipality, or town, in the country has a mayor (Filipino alkalde) and a vice mayor (Filipino bise alkalde) as well as local town officials (Sangguniang Bayan). Philippine towns, otherwise called as municipalities, are composed of a number of villages and communities called barangays with one (or a few cluster of) barangay(s) serving as the town center or poblacion. 
In the Polish language there is no linguistic distinction between a city and a town. The word for both is miasto, as a form of settlement distinct from following: village (wieś), hamlet (przysiółek), settlement (osada), or colony (kolonia). 
Town status is conferred by administrative decree, new towns are announced by the Government in a separate Bill effective from the first day of the year. Some settlements tend to remain villages even though they have a larger population than many smaller towns. Town may be called in diminutive way as "miasteczko", what is colloquially used for localities with a few thousand residents. 
In this context, the town or city is subordinate to the local authority (civil parish or municipality, in comparison to the North American context, where they have political functions. In special cases, some villages may be granted the status of town if they possess historical, cultural or architectonic importance. 
The Portuguese urban settlements heraldry reflects the difference between towns and cities,[17] with the coat of arms of a town bearing a crown with 4 towers, while the coat of arms of a city bears a crown with 5 towers. This difference between towns and cities is still in use in other Portuguese speaking countries, but in Brazil is no longer in use. 
In Romania there is no official distinction between a city and a town (the word for both in Romanian is: oraş). Cities and towns in Romania can have the status either of oraş municipiu, conferred to large urban areas, or only oraş to smaller urban localities. Some settlements remain villages (comune) even though they have a larger population than other smaller towns. 
193 countries have been involved in a common effort to agree on a common statistical definition of the three categories: cities, towns and rural areas.[4][5] 
In Ukraine the term town (містечко, mistechko) existed from the Medieval period until 1925, when it was replaced by the Soviet regime with urban type settlement.[21] Historically, town in the Ukrainian lands was a smaller populated place that was chartered under the German town law and had a market square (see Market town). Today informally, town is also referred to cities of district significance, cities with small population, and former Jewish shtetls. 
A town is a human settlement. Towns are generally larger than villages and smaller than cities, though the criteria to distinguish between them vary considerably in different parts of the world. 
Australian geographer Thomas Griffith Taylor proposed a classification of towns based on their age and pattern of land use. He identified five types of town:[6] 
In Afghanistan, towns and cities are known as shār (Dari: شهر, Pashto: ښار).[7] As the country is an historically rural society with few larger settlements, with major cities never holding more than a few hundred thousand inhabitants before the 2000s, the lingual tradition of the country does not discriminate between towns and cities. 
In Albania "qytezë" means town, which is very similar with the word for city ("qytet"). 
Although there is no official use of the term for any settlement. In Albanian "qytezë" means "small city" or "new city", while in ancient times "small residential center within the walls of a castle". 
In Australia, most rural and regional centres of population can be called towns; many small towns have populations of less than 200.[8] The smallest may be described as townships. 
The Austrian legal system does not distinguish between villages, towns, and cities. The country is partitioned into 2098 municipalities (German: Gemeinden) of fundamentally equal rank. Larger municipalities are designated as market towns (German: Marktgemeinden) or cities (Städte), but these distinctions are purely symbolic and do not confer additional legal responsibilities. 
There is a number of smaller communities that are labelled cities because they used to be regional population centers in the distant past. The city of Rattenberg for example has about 400 inhabitants. The city of Hardegg has about 1200 inhabitants, although the historic city core − Hardegg proper without what used to be the surrounding hamlets − is home to just 80 souls. 
"Large towns" usually refers to Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna and Burgas, which have population over 200,000. Ruse and Stara Zagora are often included as well due to presence of relatively developed infrastructure and population over 100,000 threshold. It is difficult to call the remaining provincial capitals "large towns" as, in general, they are less developed and have shrinking population, some with as few as 30,000 inhabitants. 
The word "town" shares an origin with the German word Zaun, the Dutch word tuin, and the Old Norse tún.[1] The original Proto-Germanic word, *tūnan, is thought to be an early borrowing from Proto-Celtic *dūnom (cf. Old Irish dún, Welsh din).[2] 
In the Czech Republic, a municipality can obtain the title of a city (Czech: statutární město), town (Czech: město) or market town (Czech: městys). The title is granted by law. 
Statutory cities (in English usually called just "cities"), which are defined by law no. 
128/2000 Coll.,[9] can define their own self-governing municipal districts. 
There are 26 such cities, in addition to Prague, which is a de facto statutory city. All the Czech municipalities with more than 40,000 inhabitants are cities. 
Cognates of "town" in many modern Germanic languages designate a fence or a hedge.[1] In English and Dutch, the meaning of the word took on the sense of the space which these fences enclosed, and through which a track must run.[citation needed] In England, a town was a small community that could not afford or was not allowed to build walls or other larger fortifications, and built a palisade or stockade instead.[citation needed] In the Netherlands, this space was a garden, more specifically those of the wealthy, which had a high fence or a wall around them (like the garden of the palace of Het Loo in Apeldoorn, which was the model for the privy garden of William III and Mary II at Hampton Court). In Old Norse tún means a (grassy) place between farmhouses, and the word is still used with a similar meaning in modern Norwegian. 
In Denmark, in many contexts no distinction is made between "city", "town" and "village"; all three translate as "by". In more specific use, for small villages and hamlets the word "landsby" (meaning "country town") is used, while the Danish equivalent of English "city" is "storby" (meaning "large town"). For formal purposes, urban areas having at least 200 inhabitants are counted as "by".[10] 
In Finland, there is no distinction between a town and a city as the word kaupunki is used for both bigger and smaller settlements, which are bigger than villages and boroughs; although in a way, when talking about the word town, it could also use the word pikkukaupunki (pikku means "little" or "small"). There are almost one hundred municipal towns in Finland. 
Old English tūn became a common place-name suffix in England and southeastern Scotland during the Anglo-Saxon settlement period. 
In Old English and Early and Middle Scots, the words ton, toun, etc. could refer to diverse kinds of settlements from agricultural estates and holdings, partly picking up the Norse sense (as in the Scots word fermtoun) at one end of the scale, to fortified municipalities.[citation needed] Other common Anglo-Saxon suffixes included ham 'home', stede 'stead', and burh 'bury, borough, burgh'. 
The French term for "town" is "bourg"[11] but French laws does not really distinguish between towns and cities which are all commonly called "villes". However, some laws do treat these authorities differently based on the population and different rules apply to the three big cities Paris, Lyon and Marseille. For historical reasons, six communes in the Meuse département exist as independent administrative entities despite having no inhabitants at all. 
Germans do not, in general, differentiate between 'city' and 'town'. The German word for both is Stadt, as it is the case in many other languages that do not differentiate between these Anglo-Saxon concepts. The word for a 'village', as a smaller settlement, is Dorf. 
However, the International Statistics Conference of 1887 defined different sizes of Stadt, based on their population size, as follows: Landstadt ("country town"; under 5,000), Kleinstadt ("small town"; 5,000 to 20,000), Mittelstadt ("middle town"; between 20,000 and 100,000) and Großstadt ("large town"; 100,000 to 1,000,000).[12] The term Großstadt may be translated as "city". In addition, Germans may speak of a Millionenstadt, a city with anywhere between one and five million inhabitants (such as Munich, Hamburg and Berlin). Also, a city with more than five million inhabitants is often referred to as a Megastadt (Commonly translated as Megacity) 
In some cases, "town" is an alternative name for "city" or "village" (especially a larger village). 
Sometimes, the word "town" is short for "township". In general, today towns can be differentiated from townships, villages, or hamlets on the basis of their economic character, in that most of a town's population will tend to derive their living from manufacturing industry, commerce, and public services rather than primary sector industries such as agriculture or related activities. 
A place's population size is not a reliable determinant of urban character. 
In many areas of the world, e.g. in India at least until recent times, a large village might contain several times as many people as a small town. In the United Kingdom, there are historical cities that are far smaller than the larger towns. 
The 2011 Census of India defines towns of two types: statutory town and census town. Statutory town is defined as all places with a municipality, corporation, cantonment board or notified town area committee. Census towns are defined as places that satisfy the following criteria: 
All the statutory towns, census towns and out growths are considered as urban settlements, as opposed to rural areas.[15] 
Some of the jalis are in major museums in USA and Europe. These include Indianapolis Museum of Art [9] and Metropolitan Museum of Art[10] and Victoria and Albert Museum.[11] 
A jali or jaali, (jālī, meaning "net") is the term for a perforated stone or latticed screen, usually with an ornamental pattern constructed through the use of calligraphy, geometry or natural patterns. This form of architectural decoration is common in Indo-Islamic architecture and more generally in Islamic architecture.[1] 
According to Yatin Pandya, the jali allows light and air while minimizing the sun and the rain. 
Also when the air passes through these openings, its velocity increases giving profound diffusion.[2][clarification needed] The holes are often nearly of the same width or smaller than the thickness of the stone, thus providing structural strength. It has been observed that humid areas like Kerala and Konkan have larger holes with overall lower opacity than compared with the dry climate regions of Gujarat and Rajasthan.[2] 
With the widespread use of glass in the late 19th century, and compactness of the residential areas in the modern India, jalis became less frequent for privacy and security matters.[3] 
Basic rectangular Jali stone work is seen at the Gupta period Nachna Hindu temples and the post Gupta Pattadakal temples. In China wood lattice work developed during the Han dynasty, the tradition has continued in modern Chinese architecture.[4] Sanskrit texts on architecture Silpa (650 AD), Samarangana-Sutradhara of King Bhoja (1018-1054 AD), Kāśyapā-Śilpā (1300) and Śilpā-Ratnam of sixteenth century mention or discuss jalis.[5] 
Early jali work with multiple geometric shapes was built by carving into stone, in geometric patterns,\ first appears in the Alai Darwaza of 1305 at Delhi besides the Qutub Minar, while later the Mughals used very finely carved plant-based designs, as at the Taj Mahal. They also often added pietra dura inlay to the surrounds, using marble and semi-precious stones.[1][6] 
In the Gwalior fort, near the Urwahi gate, there is a 17 line inscription dated Samvat 1553, mentioning names of some craftsmen and their creations. One of them is Khedu, who was an expert in "Gwaliyai jhilmili" i.e. jali screen crafted in the Gwalior style.[7] The Mughal period tomb of Muhammad Ghaus built in 1565 AD at Gwalior is remarkable for its stone jalis. 
[8]Many of the Gwalior's 19th century houses used stone jalis. Jalis are used extensively in Gwalior's Usha Kiran Palace Hotel, formerly Scindia's guest house. 
Bulls are much more muscular than cows, with thicker bones, larger feet, a very muscular neck, and a large, bony head with protective ridges over the eyes. These features assist bulls in fighting for domination over a herd, giving the winner superior access to cows for reproduction.[4] The hair is generally shorter on the body, but the neck and head often have a "mane" of curlier, wooly hair. 
Bulls are usually about the same height as cows or a little taller, but because of the additional muscle and bone mass, they often weigh far more. Most of the time, a bull has a hump on his shoulders.[5] 
In horned cattle, the horns of bulls tend to be thicker and somewhat shorter than those of cows,[6] and in many breeds, they curve outwards in a flat arc rather than upwards in a lyre shape. 
It is not true, as is commonly believed, that bulls have horns and cows do not: the presence of horns depends on the breed, or in horned breeds on whether the horns have been disbudded. (It is true, however, that in many breeds of sheep only the males have horns.) Cattle that naturally do not have horns are referred to as polled, or muleys.[7] 
Castrated male cattle are physically similar to females in build and horn shape, although if allowed to reach maturity, they may be considerably taller than either bulls or cows, with heavily muscled shoulders and necks.[8] 
Reproductive anatomy 
Bulls become fertile around seven months of age. Their fertility is closely related to the size of their testicles, and one simple test of fertility is to measure the circumference of the scrotum; a young bull is likely to be fertile once this reaches 28 centimetres (11 in); that of a fully adult bull may be over 40 centimetres (16 in).[9][10]Bulls have a fibroelastic penis. Given the small amount of erectile tissue, little enlargement occurs after erection. 
The penis is quite rigid when not erect, and becomes even more rigid during erection. Protrusion is not affected much by erection, but more by relaxation of the retractor penis muscle and straightening of the sigmoid flexure.[11][12][13] Bulls are occasionally affected by a condition known as "corkscrew penis".[14][15] The penis of a mature bull is about 3–4 cm in diameter,[16][17][18][19] and 80–100 cm in length.[20] The bull's glans penis has a rounded and elongated shape.[20] 
A common misconception widely repeated in depictions of bull behavior is that the color red angers bulls, inciting them to charge. In fact, like most mammals, cattle are red–green color blind.[21] In bullfighting, the movement of the matador's cape, and not the color, provokes a reaction in the bull. 
A bull is an intact (i.e., not castrated) adult male of the species Bos taurus. More muscular and aggressive than the females of the same species, the cows, bulls have long been an important symbol in many cultures, and play a significant role in beef ranching, dairy farming, and a variety of other cultural activities, including bullfighting and bull riding. 
Other than the few bulls needed for breeding, the vast majority of male cattle are castrated and slaughtered for meat before the age of three years, except where they are needed (castrated) as work oxen for haulage. Most of these beef animals are castrated as calves to reduce aggressive behavior and prevent unwanted mating,[22] although some are reared as uncastrated bull beef. 
A bull is typically ready for slaughter one or two months sooner than a castrated male or a female, and produces proportionately more and leaner muscle.[22] 
Frame score is a useful way of describing the skeletal size of bulls and other cattle. Frame scores can be used as an aid to predict mature cattle sizes and aid in the selection of beef bulls. They are calculated from hip height and age. 
In sales catalogues, this measurement is frequently reported in addition to weight and other performance data such as estimated breed value.[23] 
Adult bulls may weigh between 500 and 1,000 kg (1,100 and 2,200 lb). Most are capable of aggressive behavior and require careful handling to ensure safety of humans and other animals. Those of dairy breeds may be more prone to aggression, while beef breeds are somewhat less aggressive, though beef breeds such as the Spanish Fighting Bull and related animals are also noted for aggressive tendencies, which are further encouraged by selective breeding. 
An estimated 42% of all livestock-related fatalities in Canada are a result of bull attacks, and fewer than one in 20 victims of a bull attack survives.[24] Dairy breed bulls are particularly dangerous and unpredictable; the hazards of bull handling are a significant cause of injury and death for dairy farmers in some parts of the United States.[25][26][27] The need to move a bull in and out of its pen to cover cows exposes the handler to serious jeopardy of life and limb.[28] Being trampled, jammed against a wall, or gored by a bull was one of the most frequent causes of death in the dairy industry before 1940.[29] With regard to such risks, one popular farming magazine has suggested, "Handle the bull with a staff and take no chances. 
The gentle bull, not the vicious one, most often kills or maims his keeper".[30] 
In many areas, placing rings in bulls' noses to help control them is traditional. The ring is usually made of copper, and is inserted through a small hole cut in the septum of the nose. 
It is used by attaching a lead rope either directly to it or running through it from a head collar, or for more difficult bulls, a bull pole (or bull staff) may be used. This is a rigid pole about 1 m (3 ft) long with a clip at one end; this attaches to the ring and allows the bull both to be led and to be held away from his handler. 
An aggressive bull may be kept confined in a bull pen, a robustly constructed shelter and pen, often with an arrangement to allow the bull to be fed without entering the pen. If an aggressive bull is allowed to graze outside, additional precautions may be needed to help avoid him harming people. One method is a bull mask, which either covers the bull's eyes completely, or restricts his vision to the ground immediately in front of him, so he cannot see his potential victim. 
In larger pastures, particularly where a bull is kept with other cattle, the animals may simply be fed from a pickup truck or tractor, the vehicle itself providing some protection for the humans involved. Generally, bulls kept with cows tend to be less aggressive than those kept alone. In herd situations, cows with young calves are often more dangerous to humans. 
Many cattle ranches and stations run bulls with cows, and most dairy or beef farms traditionally had at least one, if not several, bulls for purposes of herd maintenance.[31][32] However, the problems associated with handling a bull (particularly where cows must be removed from his presence to be worked) has prompted many dairy farmers to restrict themselves to artificial insemination (AI) of the cows.[33] Semen is removed from the bulls and stored in canisters of liquid nitrogen, where it is kept until it can be sold, at which time it can be very profitable; in fact, many ranchers keep bulls specifically for this purpose. 
AI is also used to improve the quality of a herd, or to introduce an outcross of bloodlines. Some ranchers prefer to use AI to allow them to breed to several different bulls in a season or to breed their best stock to a higher-quality bull than they could afford to purchase outright. AI may also be used in conjunction with embryo transfer to allow cattle producers to add new breeding to their herds. 
Aside from their reproductive duties, bulls are also used in certain sports, including bullfighting and bull riding. 
They are also incorporated into festivals and folk events such as the Running of the Bulls and were seen in ancient sports such as bull-leaping. Though less common than castrated males, bulls are used as draught oxen in some areas.[34][35] The once-popular sport of bull-baiting, in which a bull is attacked by specially bred and trained dogs (which came to be known as bulldogs), was banned in England by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835. 
As with other animals, some bulls have been regarded as pets. 
The singer Charo, for instance, has owned a pet bull named Manolo.[36] 
Sacred bulls have held a place of significance in human culture since before the beginning of recorded history. They appear in cave paintings estimated to be up to 17,000 years old. The mythic Bull of the Heavens plays a role in the ancient Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh, dating as far back as 2150 BC. 
The importance of the bull is reflected in its appearance in the zodiac as Taurus, and its numerous appearances in mythology, where it is often associated with fertility. See also Korban. In Hinduism, a bull named Nandi, usually depicted seated, is worshipped as the vehicle of the god Shiva and depicted on many of the images of that deity. 
Symbolically, the bull appears commonly in heraldry. Bulls appears as charges and crests on the arms of several British families. 
Winged bulls appear as supporters in the arms of the Worshipful Company of Butchers.[37] In modern times, the bull is used as a mascot by both amateur and professional sports teams. 
Bulls also have a special significance in Spanish culture, where the Running of the Bulls celebration occurs every year in summer. During this festival, a group of human runners called "mozos" try to outrace a group of bulls running behind them, while large crowds watch the entire race.[38] 
Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person's consent. The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority, or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability, or is below the legal age of consent.[1][2][3] The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault.[4] 
Widespread and systematic rape (e.g., war rape) and sexual slavery can occur during international conflict. 
These practices are crimes against humanity and war crimes. Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted ethnic group. 
People who have been raped can be traumatized and develop posttraumatic stress disorder.[10] Serious injuries can result along with the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. A person may face violence or threats from the rapist, and, sometimes, from the victim's family and relatives.[11][12][13] 
As of July 2013, the subscriber count of his channel, then named "That-dude", was around 240.[20] 
In 2015 and 2016, Donaldson began to gain popularity on the platform due to his “worst intros” series of videos, which rounded up and poked fun at YouTuber introductions he discovered on the site. By mid-2016, Donaldson had around 30,000 subscribers. In fall 2016, Donaldson dropped out of East Carolina University without telling (which Donaldson said occurred after only two weeks of being there) in order to pursue a full-time career as a YouTuber.[1][19] As a result, his mother made him move out of his family home.[21] 
In January 2017, Donaldson published an almost day-long video of himself counting to 100,000. 
The stunt took him 40 hours, with some parts sped up to "keep it under 24 hours".[22][better source needed] A subsequent video titled "Counting to 200,000 (Road to a Mil)" was uploaded the next month, although, according to Donaldson, it too, had to be sped up because the full fifty-five hours of counting exceeded YouTube's upload limit.[23] Donaldson also gained popularity during this period with stunts, such as attempting to break glass using a hundred megaphones, watching paint dry for an hour,[3] attempting to stay underwater for 24 hours (which ended up failing due to health issues), and an unsuccessful attempt to spin a fidget spinner for a day.[25] By 2018 Donaldson had given out $1 million through his outlandish stunts, which earned him the title of “YouTube's biggest philanthropist”.[5] 
During PewDiePie vs T-Series in 2018, a competition to become the most-subscribed channel on YouTube, Donaldson bought billboards, numerous ads and radio advertisements to help PewDiePie gain more subscribers than T-Series;[4] at the Super Bowl LIII, he bought multiple seats for him and his team whose shirts spelled out, "Sub 2 PewDiePie".[26][27][better source needed] Donaldson has stated that he runs the main channel at a loss.[28] 
In March 2019, Donaldson organized and filmed a real-life battle royale competition in Los Angeles with a prize of $200,000 (2 games were played, making game earnings of $100,000 for each game) in collaboration with Apex Legends.[29] The event and prize pool was sponsored by Apex Legends publisher Electronic Arts.[30] 
Donaldson was accused of using counterfeit money in a November 2019 video. He later explained that he used fake money to mitigate the potential safety and security risks caused by a rush of people clamoring to get the free money, and claimed that he exchanged the counterfeit bills for a real check for everyone afterwards.[1] 
In April 2020, Donaldson created a rock, paper, scissors competition stream that featured 32 influencers and a grand prize of $250,000, which at the time became YouTube's most-watched live Original event with 662,000 concurrent viewers.[31] The event was ultimately won by Nadeshot.[32] 
In October 2020, Donaldson created another influencer tournament featuring 24 competitors with a grand prize of $300,000. The tournament was ultimately won by the D'Amelio family, which caused controversy due to claims that that they cheated.[33] 
He previously announced in November 2020 that he would be making a Rewind days after YouTube announced they would not be making one. In Donaldson's video, he explains that he had always believed that YouTubers "should get more say in Rewind", and with this in mind, he decided to call "hundreds of YouTubers". At the end of the video, Donaldson gives a shoutout to PewDiePie, citing him and his 2018 Rewind as the inspiration for Donaldson's Rewind (both Rewinds featuring the editors FlyingKitty, Dolan Dark, and Grandayy, and a song by Party In Backyard).[34] 
In February 2021, Donaldson made a guest appearance on the Clubhouse app causing it to crash.[35] 
In March 2021, Donaldson signed a deal with Jellysmack which allows the company to exclusively manage distribution of his video content on Snapchat and Facebook.[36][37] 
Donaldson's videos typically feature attention-grabbing stunts. He often makes videos where he donates large amounts of money to individuals, with many of these videos being sponsored by various companies. He also sometimes hosts competitions in games, such as Minecraft, for big money prizes which includes donating a house in one of his gaming videos.[1][38] 
A typical video involves Donaldson giving away large sums of money,[39][40] such as giving $100,000 worth of items to homeless shelters in December 2018,[41] donating $32,000 to the Veterans Army Wounded Warrior Program, $70,000 to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and $10,000 to a local animal shelter in Los Angeles.[42] His expensive YouTube videos are mostly funded and sponsored through large-scale brand deals that appear as in-video ads on his videos.[43][6] In 2021, Donaldson claimed that he runs his main channel at a loss.[7] 
MrBeast has been credited with launch a new style of high cost stunt videos on YouTube, where creators pull off elaborate challenges and large-scale sponsored giveaways.[1] 
As his channel has grown Donaldson was able to hire four of his childhood friends – Chris, Chandler, Garrett and Jake – to work for him and the channel, which has led to them being regularly shown in his videos.[1] 
MrBeast has been called an early form of future creator-entrepreneurs.[44] 
Jimmy Donaldson (born May 7, 1998), better known online as MrBeast, is an American YouTuber, businessman, and philanthropist.[7] He has been credited with pioneering a genre of YouTube videos that center on expensive stunts.[8] He is also the founder of MrBeast Burger and the co-creator of Team Trees, a fundraiser for the Arbor Day Foundation, which has raised over $23 million.[9][10] He is managed by the Dallas-based talent management company Night Media.[11] 
Will Hyde, a producer for the MrBeast channel, announced in a November 2020 article with The Wake Weekly that Donaldson would launch a virtual restaurant called MrBeast Burger in December 2020. Hyde said his team worked with Virtual Dining Concepts during the development of the restaurant concept. MrBeast Burger will sell franchise rights to serve the burgers to restaurants across the US and customers will be able to order the burgers via online delivery services.[49][50] 
Donaldson is an investor of tech startup Backbone which produces the Backbone One, a controller that makes smartphones appear more similar to Nintendo Switch controllers, and the Backbone app, a content creation and social tools app for its users.[51][52] 
In March 2021, Donaldson partnered with Creative Juice financial network to introduce Juice Funds, a $2 million investment fund that offers creators up to $250,000 in exchange for equity in their YouTube channels.[53][2] 
In April 2021, Donaldson became a long-term investor and partner of financial technology company Current.[54][55] The same month, Donaldson received backlash after fans lost large amounts of money in a cryptocurrency scheme that Donaldson had invested in and promoted.[3] 
On October 25, 2019, Donaldson and former NASA engineer and YouTuber Mark Rober organized a collaborative fundraising challenge event on YouTube called #TeamTrees. 
The goal of this project was to raise $20 million for the Arbor Day Foundation by January 1, 2020 and plant trees "no later than December 2022". Every donation goes to the Arbor Day Foundation which pledges to plant one tree for every dollar. Notable YouTubers such as Rhett & Link, Marshmello, iJustine, Marques Brownlee, The Slow Mo Guys, Ninja, Simone Giertz, Jacksepticeye, and Smarter Every Day brought attention to this idea. 
Trees began to be planted in October 2019 in national parks of the United States.[56][57][better source needed] On December 19 of that year, the $20,000,000 goal was surpassed,[58] and as of May 27, 2020, the project reached over 22 million dollars. The project has also received large donations from corporate executives Jack Dorsey, Susan Wojcicki, Elon Musk,[59] and Tobias Lütke.[60][better source needed] Companies such as Discovery, Verizon and Plants vs. Zombies have also pitched in to help.[61][failed verification] 
On September 17, 2020, the YouTube channel Beast Philanthropy was created.[62] On March 26, 2021, the channel posted its first video titled "I Opened My Own Charity!"[63] where Donaldson announced the charity, food bank and Darren from previous videos as Executive Director.[64] 
Donaldson was mainly raised alongside his brother CJ in Greenville, North Carolina. Donaldson graduated from Greenville Christian Academy, a private secondary school in the area, in 2016. He briefly attended East Carolina University before dropping out. 
Donaldson suffers from Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel condition.[65] In a 2019 post on Instagram, it was revealed that Donaldson was dating Instagram model and social media influencer Maddy Spidell.[2] 
Opinion polls have shown that Donaldson is one of the most well liked YouTubers on the platform with a 2021 SurveyMonkey poll showing that 70% of respondents have a favorable view of him, compared to 12% who had an unfavorable view.[66] 
As of September 14, 2021, Donaldson's main YouTube channel "MrBeast" has 69.2 million subscribers and 12.5 billion total views.[15] It is the 11th most-subscribed channel on YouTube, as well as the second most subscribed channel owned by a YouTuber, and the most subscribed owned by a YouTuber from the United States. Aside from his main channel, Donaldson has seven other YouTube channels, including MrBeast Shorts and MrBeast Gaming, the latter reaching over 10 million subscribers in less than one year.[16] Across his eight channels, Donaldson has 121 million combined subscribers, and 17.3 billion combined views across eight of these channels. 
List of YouTubers Team Trees 
In 2019, Donaldson won the Breakout Creator by Streamy Awards. At the 12th Annual Shorty Awards in 2020, he won YouTuber of the Year. He was also one of the top 10 highest-paid YouTubers of 2020, alongside other personalities such as Markiplier, Ryan's World and Blippi.[17] 
Donaldson uploaded his first ever YouTube video in February 2012, at the age of 13 years old, under the handle "MrBeast6000"; his early content ranged from Let's Plays (mainly focused on Minecraft and Call of Duty),[18] videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers,[2] videos that offered tips to upcoming YouTube creators, and commentary on YouTube drama. During this early period of his channel, Donaldson himself made few appearances in his videos.[18]

The skin on the scrotum is more highly pigmented compared to the rest of the body. 
The septum is a connective tissue membrane dividing the scrotum into two cavities. [8] 
The scrotum lymph drains initially into the superficial inguinal lymph nodes, this then drains into the deep inguinal lymph nodes. The deep inguinal lymph nodes drain into the common iliac which ultimately releases lymph into the cisterna chyli. 
One testis is typically lower than the other, which is believed to function to avoid compression in the event of impact; in humans, the left testis is typically lower than the right.[1] An alternative view is that testis descent asymmetry evolved to enable more effective cooling of the testicles.[10] 
The scrotum or scrotal sac is an anatomical male reproductive structure located at the base of the penis that consists of a suspended dual-chambered sac of skin and smooth muscle. It is present in most terrestrial male mammals. The scrotum contains the external spermatic fascia, testes, epididymis, and ductus deferens. 
It is a distention of the perineum and carries some abdominal tissues into its cavity including the testicular artery, testicular vein, and pampiniform plexus. The perineal raphe is a small, vertical, slightly raised ridge of scrotal skin under which is found the scrotal septum. It appears as a thin longitudinal line that runs front to back over the entire scrotum. 
In humans and some other mammals the scrotum becomes covered with pubic hair at puberty. The scrotum will usually tighten during penile erection and when exposed to cold temperatures. One testis is typically lower than the other to avoid compression in the event of an impact.[1] 
The scrotum regulates the temperature of the testes and maintains it at 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), i.e. two or three degrees below the body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Higher temperatures affect spermatogenesis[13] Temperature control is accomplished by the smooth muscles of the scrotum moving the testicles either closer to or further away from the abdomen dependent upon the ambient temperature. This is accomplished by the cremaster muscle in the abdomen and the dartos fascia (muscular tissue under the skin).[12] 
A study has indicated that use of a laptop computer positioned on the lap can negatively affect sperm production.[22][23] 
The scrotum is biologically homologous to the labia majora in females. Although present in most mammals, the external scrotum is absent in streamlined marine mammals, such as whales and seals,[2] as well as in some lineages of land mammals, such as the afrotherians, xenarthrans, and numerous families of bats, rodents, and insectivores.[3][4] 
The scrotum and its contents can develop diseases or incur injuries. These include: 
Scrotal infusion, a temporary form of body modification Sex organ Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection Testicular self-examination 
Layers of the scrotum 3D anatomy 
Scrotal inflation, or scrotal infusion, is an unusual[1] sexual practice in which fluid (typically saline solution, but sometimes air or another gas[2]) is injected into the scrotum in order to make it balloon in size.[1] It carries a number of risks of serious complications, including scrotal cellulitis[3] and subcutaneous emphysema,[2][4] and possibly fatal complications such as Fournier's gangrene or air embolism.[3] 
Penile trauma can result from a blunt or penetrating injury, the latter being rarely investigated by imaging methods, almost always requiring immediate surgical exploration. In the erect penis, trauma results from stretching and narrowing of the tunica albuginea, which can undergo segmental rupture of one or both of the corpora cavernosa, constituting a penile fracture.[2] 
In 10-15% of penile traumas, there can be an accompanying urethral lesion. 
When blood is observed in the urethral meatus, contrast-enhanced evaluation of the urethra is necessary. In cases in which the ultrasound findings are inconclusive, the use of magnetic resonance imaging can facilitate the diagnosis and is recommended by various authors.[1] 
Penile fracture is a medical emergency, and emergency surgical repair is the usual treatment. Delay in seeking treatment increases the complication rate. Non-surgical approaches result in 10–50% complication rates including erectile dysfunction, permanent penile curvature, damage to the urethra and pain during sexual intercourse, while operatively treated patients experience an 11% complication rate.[1][12] 
Penile fracture is rupture of one or both of the tunica albuginea, the fibrous coverings that envelop the penis's corpora cavernosa. It is caused by rapid blunt force to an erect penis, usually during vaginal intercourse, or aggressive masturbation.[4] It sometimes also involves partial or complete rupture of the urethra or injury to the dorsal nerves, veins and arteries.[5] 
In the United States, the case of Doe v. Moe, 63 Mass. App. 
Ct. 516, 827 N.E.2d 240 (2005), tested liability for a penile fracture injury caused during sexual intercourse. 
The court declined to find duty as between two consensual adults. The plaintiff in this case, a man who suffered a fractured penis, complained that the defendant, his ex-girlfriend, had caused his injury while she was on top of him during sexual intercourse. The court ruled in her favor, determining that her conduct was neither legally wanton nor reckless. 
A popping or cracking sound, significant pain, swelling, immediate loss of erection leading to flaccidity, and skin hematoma of various sizes are commonly associated with the sexual event.[1][6] 
Penile fracture is a relatively uncommon clinical condition.[7] Vaginal intercourse and aggressive masturbation are the most common causes.[2] A 2014 study of accident and emergency records at three hospitals in Campinas, Brazil, showed that woman on top positions caused the greatest risk with the missionary position being the safest. The research conjectured that when the receptive partner is on top, they usually control the movement and are not able to interrupt movement when the penis suffers a misaligned penetration. Conversely, when the penetrative partner is controlling the movement, they have better chances of stopping in response to pain from misalignment, minimizing harm.[7] 
The practice of taqaandan (also taghaandan) also puts men at risk of penile fracture. Taqaandan, which comes from a Kurdish word meaning "to click", involves bending the top part of the erect penis while holding the lower part of the shaft in place, until a click is heard and felt. Taqaandan is said to be painless and has been compared to cracking one's knuckles, but the practice of taqaandan has led to an increase in the prevalence of penile fractures in western Iran.[8] Taqaandan may be performed to achieve detumescence.[9]

Nevertheless, the term may also be used pars pro toto to indicate all body piercings in the area of anus, perineum, genitals and mons pubis, including piercings such as anal, guiche, and pubic that do not involve perforation of genitalia. Genital piercings can be done in men or women, with various forms of piercings available. The main motive for both genders is beautification and individualization; in addition, some piercings enhance sexual pleasure by increasing stimulation.[1][2][3] Genital piercings can be found in many tribal societies, in particular in South and East Asia, where it has been part of traditional practice since ancient times. 
Early records of genital piercing are found in the Kama Sutra that was written over 2000 years ago.[citation needed] 
Like body piercings at large, genital piercings are often done for aesthetic reasons and as an expression of personal style. In addition, some (but not all) types of genital piercing increase sensitivity and provide additional stimulation during sexual intercourse or stimulation. According to an Association of Professional Piercers expert report by Elayne Angel, body piercing pioneer, former member of The Gauntlet and inventor of several genital piercings such as the fourchette and the lorum, individual motives and preferences are quite diverse: 
Additionally, genital piercings can enhance sexual pleasure during masturbation, foreplay and intercourse. While female genital piercings do this only to the women wearing them, male genital piercings can enhance stimulation for both the person wearing the jewelry and their partner by stimulating both the glans of the wearer and the vaginal wall or the anus of the penetrated partner. Due to genital physiology, women seem to gain more sexual pleasure from both, their own as well as her partner's genital piercings. 
This effect is in particular reported for piercings passing through the glans penis: the ampallang and apadravya piercing. Women of the Dayak in Sarawak, Borneo prefer men with an ampallang, claiming that intercourse without would be dull: 
Paolo Mantegazza stated, ″The Dayak women have a right to insist upon the ampallang and if the man does not consent they may seek separation. 
They say that the embrace without this contrivance is plain rice; with it is rice with salt."[26] On another account by the anthropologist Tom Harrisson, who spent much of his life in Borneo and interviewed natives about the traditional ampallang; he stated, "the function of this device is, superficially, to add to the sexual pleasure of the women by stimulating and extending the inner walls of the vagina. It is, in this, in my experience, decidedly successful."[27] 
Some physicians believe that male genital piercings increase the risk of STD transmission by making safer sex barriers (condoms) less effective.[30][31][32] Most professional piercers and body art enthusiasts believe these risks are over-stated or nonexistent. 
In two surveys, 5%–18% of men with genital piercings reported unspecified "problems using condoms" though it is unclear how many of these men used condoms regularly.[33] There is no conclusive evidence that wearers of genital piercings are more likely to contract sexually transmitted infections.[33] 
The time to fully heal a genital piercing varies tremendously, depending on piercing site and individual characteristics: it can range from a week up to six months. Until fully healed, preparations should be made against possible causes of infection, such as proper cleaning on a daily basis. People with fresh piercings should abstain from sexual activity for the first few days and also then should use physical protection barriers such as condoms until the piercing is fully healed. 
In many European countries, minors are required to bring a signed consent form from or to be escorted by a legal guardian. Even in countries that have no laws regulating genital piercing in minors, many piercers refrain from doing them (since physiological development is not completed in minors). In the United States, it is prohibited to pierce the genitals of persons younger than 18 years. 
Possible piercing sites on the male genitalia include the glans, the skin of the penis shaft, the scrotum or the perineum. 
Piercings through the glans of the penis include the ampallang, which passes horizontally, and the apadravya, that passes vertically through the glans. The Prince Albert piercing is situated on the ventral side (underside) of the penis immediately behind the glans, while the reverse Prince Albert piercing passes through the dorsal (top) side of the glans. The dydoe pierces through the coronal rim of the glans. 
These piercings provide increased stimulation during intercourse to the male (who is carrying the piercing) as well as to the partner. Piercings through the head, or the glans, are the genital piercings with the best-documented historical evidence.[35] 
Foreskin piercing passes through the penile prepuce on the dorsal, ventral or lateral side. It is required that the male isn't circumcised. The frenum piercing passes through the penile frenum, a small skin bridge that connects the glans with the shaft skin. 
This anatomical part is also often missing in circumcised men. The hafada piercing is situated on the skin of the scrotum. As an intermediate version between frenulum and hafada, the lorum piercing (low frenum) sits at the point where penis and scrotum connect. 
The Jacob's Ladder is a ladder from frenum to scrotum. The guiche piercing is a body piercing on the perineum. 
These piercings play a lesser role in adding stimulation and more or less fulfill only a decorative purpose. 
The glans of the clitoris itself can be pierced. Since this anatomical part is too small in many cases, this piercing is not very common. In contrast, the clitoral hood piercing is the most common genital piercing for female bodied individuals. 
It can be applied horizontally and vertically. The deep hood piercing is a variation of the clitoral hood piercing that pass deeper through the clitoral hood. 
The Isabella piercing passes vertically through the clitoral shaft and is rather complicated to pierce. 
Through the dorsal rim of the vulval vestibule passes the Fourchette piercing. A less common version of the Fourchette is the Suitcase piercing, which can be considered as a deep Fourchette (it enters on the perineum). Also rather uncommon is the Princess Albertina piercing, the female version of the Prince Albert piercing, that passes through the ventral (lower) wall of the urethra. 
The Christina piercing is a surface piercing, situated on the upper part of the mons pubis where the outer labia meet. It is similar to the Nefertiti piercing, that can be seen as a combination between vertical clitoral hood piercing and Christina piercing. 
Body piercings that do not involve perforation of genitalia but referred to as "genital piercings" by convention can be worn by all sexes. These include the pubic piercing, which is situated above the penis in males and on the mons pubic in females (comparable to the Christina piercing, but horizontally). The guiche piercing passes horizontally through the perineum while the anal piercing passes through the anus. 
The Bible and Critical Theory is a biannual peer-reviewed open access academic journal in the fields of biblical studies and critical theory. It was established by Roland Boer in 2004, and was published by Monash University ePress until 2010. Since 2011 it has been published independently.[1] Julie Kelso was the editor-in-chief from 2008-2011, and then she co-edited with Boer from 2012-2015. 
The journal is abstracted and indexed in the ATLA Religion Database[2] and Scopus.[3] 
The three-part division reflected in the acronym Tanakh is well attested in the rabbinic literature.[8] During that period, however, Tanakh was not used. Instead, the proper title was Mikra (or Miqra, מקרא, meaning reading or that which is read) because the biblical texts were read publicly. 
The acronym 'Tanakh' is first recorded in the medieval era.[9] Mikra continues to be used in Hebrew to this day, alongside Tanakh, to refer to the Hebrew scriptures. 
In modern spoken Hebrew, they are interchangeable.[10] 
The inter-relationship between various significant ancient manuscripts of the Old Testament (some identified by their siglum). 
Mt being the Masoretic text. The lowermost text "(lost)" would be the Urtext. 
According to Louis Ginzberg's Legends of the Jews, the twenty-four book canon of the Hebrew Bible was fixed by Ezra and the scribes in the Second Temple period.[20] 
The number of distinct words in the Hebrew Bible is 8,679, of which 1,480 are hapax legomena,[25]: 112 words or expressions that occur only once. The number of distinct Semitic roots, on which many of these biblical words are based, is roughly 2000.[25]: 112 
The Hebrew Bible or Tanakh[lower-alpha 1] (/tɑːˈnɑːx/;[1] Hebrew: תַּנַ״ךְ‎, pronounced [taˈnaχ] or [təˈnax]), is the canonical collection of Hebrew scriptures, including the Torah. These texts are almost exclusively in Biblical Hebrew, with a few passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel and Ezra, the verse Jeremiah 10:11,[2] and some single words). 
The Tanakh consists of twenty-four books, counting as one book each 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel, 1 Kings and 2 Kings, 1 Chronicles and 2 Chronicles, and Ezra–Nehemiah. The Twelve Minor Prophets (תרי עשר‎) are also counted as a single book. In Hebrew, the books are often referred to by their prominent first word(s). 
The Torah (תּוֹרָה, literally "teaching"), also known as the Pentateuch, or as the "Five Books of Moses". Printed versions (rather than scrolls) of the Torah are often called "Chamisha Chumshei Torah"" (חמישה חומשי תורה‎ "Five fifth-sections of the Torah") and informally a "Chumash". 
Nevi'im (נְבִיאִים‎ Nəḇī'īm, "Prophets") is the second main division of the Tanakh, between the Torah and Ketuvim. This division includes the books which cover the time from the entrance of the Israelites into the Land of Israel until the Babylonian captivity of Judah (the "period of prophecy"). Their distribution is not chronological, but substantive. 
The form of this text that is authoritative for Rabbinic Judaism is known as the Masoretic Text (MT) and consists of 24 books, and is sorted and numbered using perek and pasuk (Chapters and verses of the Bible). The contents of the Hebrew Bible is similar to the Protestant Christian Old Testament, in which the material is divided into 39 books and arranged in a different order. 
Catholic Bibles, Eastern / Greek Orthodox Bibles and Ethiopian Orthodox Bibles contain additional materials, derived from the Septuagint (texts translated into Koine Greek) and other sources. 
In addition to the Masoretic Text, modern scholars seeking to understand the history of the Hebrew Bible use a range of sources.[3] These include the Septuagint, the Syriac language Peshitta translation, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Dead Sea Scrolls collection and quotations from rabbinic manuscripts. These sources may be older than the Masoretic Text in some cases and often differ from it.[4] These differences have given rise to the theory that yet another text, an Urtext of the Hebrew Bible, once existed and is the source of the versions extant today.[5] However, such an Urtext has never been found, and which of the three commonly known versions (Septuagint, Masoretic Text, Samaritan Pentateuch) is closest to the Urtext is debated.[6] 
These three books are also the only ones in Tanakh with a special system of cantillation notes that are designed to emphasize parallel stichs within verses. However, the beginning and end of the book of Job are in the normal prose system. 
The five relatively short books of the Song of Songs, the Book of Ruth, the Book of Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and the Book of Esther are collectively known as the Ḥamesh Megillot (Five Megillot). These are the latest books collected and designated as "authoritative" in the Jewish canon, with the latest parts having dates ranging into the 2nd century BCE. These scrolls are traditionally read over the course of the year in many Jewish communities. 
Besides the three poetic books and the five scrolls, the remaining books in Ketuvim are Daniel, Ezra–Nehemiah and Chronicles. Although there is no formal grouping for these books in the Jewish tradition, they nevertheless share a number of distinguishing characteristics. 
Nach, also anglicized Nakh, refers to the Nevi'im and Ketuvim portions of Tanakh.[28][29] Nach is often referred to as its own subject,[3] separate from Torah.[31] 
It is a major subject in the curriculum of Orthodox high schools for girls and in the seminaries which they subsequently attend,[1] and is often taught by different teachers than those who teach Chumash.[30] The curriculum of Orthodox high schools for boys includes only some portions of Nach, such as the book of Joshua, the book of Judges,[32] and the Five Megillot.[33] 
The major commentary used for the Chumash is the Rashi commentary. The Rashi commentary and Metzudot commentary are the major commentaries for the Nach.[34][35] 
Tanakh is an acronym, made from the first Hebrew letter of each of the Masoretic Text's three traditional divisions: Torah (literally 'Instruction' or 'Law'),[7] Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings)—hence TaNaKh. 
Most common are materials based on polydimethylsiloxane, which is derived by hydrolysis of dimethyldichlorosilane. This dichloride reacts with water as follows: 
The polymerization typically produces linear chains capped with Si−Cl or Si−OH (silanol) groups. Under different conditions, the polymer is a cyclic, not a chain.[1] 
For consumer applications such as caulks silyl acetates are used instead of silyl chlorides. The hydrolysis of the acetates produces the less dangerous acetic acid (the acid found in vinegar) as the reaction product of a much slower curing process. This chemistry is used in many consumer applications, such as silicone caulk and adhesives. 
Branches or crosslinks in the polymer chain can be introduced by using organosilicone precursors with fewer alkyl groups, such as methyl trichlorosilane and methyltrimethoxysilane. Ideally, each molecule of such a compound becomes a branch point. This process can be used to produce hard silicone resins. 
They are typically colorless, oils or rubber-like substances. Silicones are used in sealants, adhesives, lubricants, medicine, cooking utensils, and thermal and electrical insulation. Some common forms include silicone oil, silicone grease, silicone rubber, silicone resin, and silicone caulk.[1][2] 
Silicones exhibit many useful characteristics, including:[1] 
Silicone can be developed into rubber sheeting, where it has other properties, such as being FDA compliant. This extends the uses of silicone sheeting to industries that demand hygiene, for example, food and beverage and pharmaceutical. 
Applications 
Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry lists the following major categories of application: Electrical (e.g. insulation), electronics (e.g., coatings), household (e.g., sealants and cooking utensils), automobile (e.g. gaskets), airplane (e.g., seals), office machines (e.g. keyboard pads), medicine and dentistry (e.g. tooth impression molds), textiles and paper (e.g. coatings). 
For these applications, an estimated 400,000 tonnes of silicones were produced in 1991.[clarification needed] Specific examples, both large and small are presented below.[1] 
In the automotive field, silicone grease is typically used as a lubricant for brake components since it is stable at high temperatures, is not water-soluble, and is far less likely than other lubricants to foul. DOT 5 brake fluids are based on liquid silicones. 
Automotive spark plug wires are insulated by multiple layers of silicone to prevent sparks from jumping to adjacent wires, causing misfires. Silicone tubing is sometimes used in automotive intake systems (especially for engines with forced induction). 
Automotive body manufacturing plants and paint shops avoid silicones, as trace contamination may cause "fish eyes", which are small, circular craters which mar a smooth finish.[citation needed] 
Additionally, silicone compounds such as silicone rubber are used as coatings and sealants for airbags; the high strength of silicone rubber makes it an optimal adhesive and sealant for high impact airbags.[citation needed] Silicones in combination with thermoplastics provide improvements in scratch and mar resistance and lowered coefficient of friction.[citation needed] 
The strength and reliability of silicone rubber are widely acknowledged in the construction industry. 
One-part silicone sealants and caulks are in common use to seal gaps, joints and crevices in buildings. One-part silicones cure by absorbing atmospheric moisture, which simplifies installation. In plumbing, silicone grease is typically applied to O-rings in brass taps and valves, preventing lime from sticking to the metal. 
Structural silicone has also been used in curtain wall building façades since 1974 when the Art Institute of Chicago became the first building to receive exterior glass fixed only with the material.[citation needed] Silicone membranes have been used to cover and restore industrial roofs, thanks to its extreme UV resistance, and ability to keep their waterproof performance for decades.[citation needed] 
By varying the −Si−O− chain lengths, side groups, and crosslinking, silicones can be synthesized with a wide variety of properties and compositions. They can vary in consistency from liquid to gel to rubber to hard plastic. The most common siloxane is linear polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a silicone oil.[citation needed] The second-largest group of silicone materials is based on silicone resins, which are formed by branched and cage-like oligosiloxanes.[citation needed] 
Liquid silicone can be used as a dry cleaning solvent, providing an alternative to the traditional chlorine-containing perchloroethylene (perc) solvent. The use of silicones in dry cleaning reduces the environmental effect of a typically high-polluting industry.[citation needed] 
Electronics 
Silicone foam has been used in North American buildings in an attempt to firestop openings within the fire-resistance-rated wall and floor assemblies to prevent the spread of flames and smoke from one room to another. When properly installed, silicone-foam firestops can be fabricated for building code compliance. Advantages include flexibility and high dielectric strength. 
Silicone-foam firestops have been the subject of controversy and press attention due to smoke development from pyrolysis of combustible components within the foam, hydrogen gas escape, shrinkage, and cracking. These problems have led to reportable events among licensees (operators of nuclear power plants) of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).[citation needed] 
Silicone greases are used for many purposes, such as bicycle chains, airsoft gun parts, and a wide range of other mechanisms. 
Typically, a dry-set lubricant is delivered with a solvent carrier to penetrate the mechanism. The solvent then evaporates, leaving a clear film that lubricates but does not attract dirt and grit as much as an oil-based or other traditional "wet" lubricant. 
Two-part silicone systems are used as rubber molds to cast resins, foams, rubber, and low-temperature alloys. A silicone mold generally requires little or no mold-release or surface preparation, as most materials do not adhere to silicone. For experimental uses, ordinary one-part silicone can be used to make molds or to mold into shapes. 
If needed, common vegetable cooking oils or petroleum jelly can be used on mating surfaces as a mold-release agent.[14] 
Silicones are used in shaving products and personal lubricants.[16] 
Silly Putty and similar materials are composed of silicones dimethyl siloxane, polydimethylsiloxane, and decamethyl cyclopentasiloxane, with other ingredients. This substance is noted for its unusual characteristics, e.g., that it bounces, but breaks when given a sharp blow; it will also flow like a liquid and form a puddle given enough time. 
Silicone "rubber bands" are a long-lasting popular replacement refill for real rubber bands in the 2013 fad "rubber band loom" toys at two to four times the price (in 2014). Silicone bands also come in bracelet sizes that can be custom embossed with a name or message. Large silicone bands are also sold as utility tie-downs. 
Formerol is a silicone rubber (marketed as Sugru) used as an arts-and-crafts material, as its plasticity allows it to be molded by hand like modeling clay. It hardens at room temperature and it is adhesive to various substances including glass and aluminum.[17] 
The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, typically orange in color, though purple, black, red, white, and yellow cultivars exist,[2][3][4] all of which are domesticated forms of the wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and Southwestern Asia. The plant probably originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the stems and leaves are also eaten. 
Daucus carota is a biennial plant. In the first year, its rosette of leaves produces large amounts of sugars, which are stored in the taproot to provide energy for the plant to flower in the second year.[citation needed] 
Most of the taproot consists of a pulpy outer cortex (phloem) and an inner core (xylem). High-quality carrots have a large proportion of cortex compared to core. 
Although a completely xylem-free carrot is not possible, some cultivars have small and deeply pigmented cores; the taproot can appear to lack a core when the colour of the cortex and core are similar in intensity. Taproots are typically long and conical, although cylindrical and nearly-spherical cultivars are available. The root diameter can range from 1 cm (3⁄8 in) to as much as 10 cm (4 in) at the widest part. 
At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars need a month longer (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are a good source of vitamin K and vitamin B6. 
Flower development begins when the flat meristem changes from producing leaves to an uplifted, conical meristem capable of producing stem elongation and a cluster of flowers. The cluster is a compound umbel, and each umbel contains several smaller umbels (umbellets). The first (primary) umbel occurs at the end of the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels grow from the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and even later-flowering umbels.[1] 
Flowers change sex in their development, so the stamens release their pollen before the stigma of the same flower is receptive. The arrangement is centripetal, meaning the oldest flowers are near the edge and the youngest flowers are in the center. Flowers usually first open at the outer edge of the primary umbel, followed about a week later on the secondary umbels, and then in subsequent weeks in higher-order umbels.[1] 
The usual flowering period of individual umbels is 7 to 10 days, so a plant can be in the process of flowering for 30–50 days. The distinctive umbels and floral nectaries attract pollinating insects. After fertilization and as seeds develop, the outer umbellets of an umbel bend inward causing the umbel shape to change from slightly convex or fairly flat to concave, and when cupped it resembles a bird's nest.[1] 
The carrot is a diploid species, and has nine relatively short, uniform-length chromosomes (2n=18).[1][2] The genome size is estimated to be 473 mega base pairs, which is four times larger than Arabidopsis thaliana, one-fifth the size of the maize genome, and about the same size as the rice genome.[28] 
Polyacetylenes can be found in Apiaceae vegetables like carrots where they show cytotoxic activities.[29][30] Falcarinol and falcarindiol (cis-heptadeca-1,9-diene-4,6-diyne-3,8-diol)[31] are such compounds. This latter compound shows antifungal activity towards Mycocentrospora acerina and Cladosporium cladosporioides.[31] Falcarindiol is the main compound responsible for bitterness in carrots.[32] 
Carrots are grown from seed and can take up to four months (120 days) to mature, but most cultivars mature within 70 to 80 days under the right conditions.[35] They grow best in full sun but tolerate some shade.[36] The optimum temperature is 16 to 21 °C (61 to 70 °F).[37] The ideal soil is deep, loose and well-drained, sandy or loamy, with a pH of 6.3 to 6.8.[38] 
Fertilizer should be applied according to soil type because the crop requires low levels of nitrogen, moderate phosphate and high potash. 
Rich or rocky soils should be avoided, as these will cause the roots to become hairy and/or misshapen.[39] Irrigation is applied when needed to keep the soil moist. After sprouting, the crop is eventually thinned to a spacing of 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) and weeded to prevent competition beneath the soil.[2][40] 
Carrot cultivars can be grouped into two broad classes, eastern carrots and western carrots.[46] A number of novelty cultivars have been bred for particular characteristics.[2][3] 
"Eastern" (a European and American continent reference) carrots were domesticated in Persia (probably in the lands of modern-day Iran and Afghanistan within West Asia) during the 10th century, or possibly earlier. Specimens of the "eastern" carrot that survive to the present day are commonly purple or yellow, and often have branched roots. The purple colour common in these carrots comes from anthocyanin pigments.[47] 
The western carrot emerged in the Netherlands in the 17th century.[48] There is a popular belief that its orange colour making it popular in those countries as an emblem of the House of Orange and the struggle for Dutch independence, although there is little evidence for this.[24][3] The orange colour results from abundant carotenes in these cultivars. 
Chantenay carrots. 
Although the roots are shorter than other cultivars, they have vigorous foliage and greater girth, being broad in the shoulders and tapering towards a blunt, rounded tip. They store well, have a pale-coloured core and are mostly used for processing.[40] Cultivars include 'Carson Hybrid' and 'Red Cored Chantenay'. Danvers carrots. 
These have strong foliage and the roots are longer than Chantenay types, and they have a conical shape with a well-defined shoulder, tapering to a point. They are somewhat shorter than Imperator cultivars, but more tolerant of heavy soil conditions. Danvers cultivars store well and are used both fresh and for processing.[40] They were developed in 1871 in Danvers, Massachusetts.[49] Cultivars include 'Danvers Half Long' and 'Danvers 126'. 
Imperator carrots. 
This cultivar has vigorous foliage, is of high sugar content, and has long and slender roots, tapering to a pointed tip. Imperator types are the most widely cultivated by commercial growers.[40] Cultivars include 'Imperator 58' and 'Sugarsnax Hybrid'. Nantes carrots. 
These have sparse foliage, are cylindrical, short with a more blunt tip than Imperator types, and attain high yields in a range of conditions. The skin is easily damaged and the core is deeply pigmented. They are brittle, high in sugar and store less well than other types.[40] Cultivars include 'Nelson Hybrid', 'Scarlet Nantes' and 'Sweetness Hybrid'. 
Carrot breeding programs have developed new cultivars to have dense amounts of chemically-stable acylated pigments, such as anthocyanins, which enrich carrot color based on the density and types of anthocyanin to produce different carrot colors.[1][2] One particular cultivar lacks the usual orange pigment due to carotene, owing its white colour to a recessive gene for tocopherol (vitamin E), but this cultivar and wild carrots do not provide nutritionally significant amounts of vitamin E.[50] 
Carrots can be stored for several months in the refrigerator or over winter in a moist, cool place. For long term storage, unwashed carrots can be placed in a bucket between layers of sand, a 50/50 mix of sand and wood shavings, or in soil. A temperature range of 0 to 4 °C (32 to 40 °F) is best.[52][53] 
Carrots can be eaten in a variety of ways. Only 3 percent of the β-carotene in raw carrots is released during digestion: this can be improved to 39% by pulping, cooking and adding cooking oil.[54] Alternatively they may be chopped and boiled, fried or steamed, and cooked in soups and stews, as well as baby and pet foods. A well-known dish is carrots julienne.[55] Together with onion and celery, carrots are one of the primary vegetables used in a mirepoix to make various broths.[56] 
In India carrots are used in a variety of ways, as salads or as vegetables added to spicy rice or dal dishes. A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has carrots grated and cooked in milk until the whole mixture is solid, after which nuts and butter are added.[64] Carrot salads are usually made with grated carrots with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green chillies popped in hot oil. Carrots can also be cut in thin strips and added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables or can be blended with tamarind to make chutney.[65] 
Since the late 1980s, baby carrots or mini-carrots (carrots that have been peeled and cut into uniform cylinders) have been a popular ready-to-eat snack food available in many supermarkets.[66] Carrots are puréed and used as baby food, dehydrated to make chips, flakes, and powder, and thinly sliced and deep-fried, like potato chips.[2] 
The sweetness of carrots allows the vegetable to be used in some fruit-like roles. Grated carrots are used in carrot cakes, as well as carrot puddings, an English dish thought to have originated in the early 19th century.[68] Carrots can also be used alone or blended with fruits in jams and preserves. Carrot juice is also widely marketed, especially as a health drink, either stand-alone or blended with juices extracted from fruits and other vegetables.[69] 
Highly excessive consumption over a period of time can result in carotenemia, a yellow-orange discoloration of the skin caused by a build up of carotenoids.[70] 
Raw carrots are 88% water, 9% carbohydrates, 0.9% protein, 2.8% dietary fiber, 1% ash and 0.2% fat.[1] Carrot dietary fiber comprises mostly cellulose, with smaller proportions of hemicellulose, lignin and starch.[67] Free sugars in carrot include sucrose, glucose, and fructose.[71] 
The provitamin A beta-carotene from carrots does not actually help people to see in the dark unless they suffer from vitamin A deficiency.[75] This myth was propaganda used by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War to explain why their pilots had improved success during night air battles, but was actually used to disguise advances in radar technology and the use of red lights on instrument panels.[76] 
Nevertheless, the consumption of carrots was advocated in Britain at the time as part of a Dig for Victory campaign. A radio programme called The Kitchen Front encouraged people to grow, store and use carrots in various novel ways, including making carrot jam and Woolton pie, named after the Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food.[77] The British public during WWII generally believed that eating carrots would help them see better at night and in 1942 there was a 100,000-ton surplus of carrots from the extra production.[78] 
In 2018, world production of carrots (combined with turnips) was 40 million tonnes, with China producing 45% of the world total (table).[51] Other major producers were the United States, Uzbekistan, and Russia.[51] 
İbrahim Melih Gökçek (Turkish pronunciation: [ibɾaˈhim meˈlih ˈɟœctʃec];[verification needed] born 20 October 1948) is a Turkish politician who served as the Mayor of Ankara from 1994 to 2017. From 1991 to 1994, he was an MP. Gökçek has won municipal elections in 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009, and was controversially also declared the winner in 2014. 
Gökçek was born at Keçiören in Ankara. 
The Gökçek family, originally from Halfeti, moved to Gaziantep for father Ahmet Gökçek's career as a lawyer. Gökçek was of partial Kosova origin. 
Having his primary, secondary and high school education in Gaziantep, Melih Gökçek graduated from Gazi University, College of Journalism, in Ankara. He worked as Parliament Correspondent and newspaper representative. Gökçek completed his military service as a Reserve Officer at Güzelyurt in Northern Cyprus.[1] 
He supports Ankaraspor in Ankara. 
He is the honorary chairman of MKE Ankaragücü. Football and photography are the greatest hobbies of Gökçek, who is married to Nevin Gökçek, and has two sons, Ahmet and Osman.[1] His son Osman Gökçek is the general editorial coordinator of the Turkish TV channel Beyaz TV.[3] 
After he returned from military service, Gökçek set up a business. Then, as a member of the Motherland Party, he acted from 1984 to 1989 as the Mayor of Keçiören, a district in Ankara, under the leadership of the Mayor of Ankara Metropolitan Municipality, Mehmet Altinsoy.[1] 
Subsequently, Melih Gökçek ran the Social Services and Child Protection Society as its General Director from 1989 to 1991. 
In 1991, he entered the parliament as Ankara MP for the Welfare Party. While he was an MP during local elections in 1994, he stood for the post of Mayor of Ankara and won the election.[1] 
According to the histological findings of the British Association of Urological Surgeons based on a research conducted on the autopsy of 22 foreskins, "the prepuce provides a large and important platform for several nerves and nerve endings",[5] The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia has written that the foreskin is "composed of an outer skin and an inner mucosa that is rich in specialized sensory nerve endings and erogenous tissue."[6] 
In 2007 The World Health Organization (2007) said that there was "debate about the role of the foreskin, with possible functions including keeping the glans moist, protecting the developing penis in utero, or enhancing sexual pleasure due to the presence of nerve receptors".[1] The foreskin helps to provide sufficient skin during an erection.[16] 
The foreskin protects the glans.[1] The foreskin protects the glans of infants from ammonia and feces in diapers, which reduces the incidence of meatal stenosis, and continues to protect the glans from abrasions and trauma throughout life.[2] The fold of the prepuce maintains sub-preputial wetness, which can cause smegma when proper hygiene is not performed.[citation needed] 
The foreskin contains Meissner's corpuscles, which are nerve endings involved in fine-touch sensitivity. A study of skin samples found that, compared to other hairless skin areas on the body, the Meissner's index was highest in the finger tip (0.96) and lowest in the foreskin (0.28) suggested that the foreskin has the least sensitive hairless tissue of the body.[12] Histological studies research into the sensory properties of the penis have found that the foreskin has "no role in sexual sensation".[17] 
In primates, the foreskin is present in the genitalia of both sexes and likely has been present for millions of years of evolution.[18] The evolution of complex penile morphologies like the foreskin may have been influenced by females.[19][20][21] 
The foreskin is the double-layered fold of smooth muscle tissue, blood vessels, neurons, skin, and mucous membrane part of the penis that covers and protects the glans penis and the urinary meatus.[1] The foreskin is mobile, fairly stretchable, and acts as a natural lubricant. The foreskin is also described as the prepuce, a technically broader term that also includes the clitoral hood in women, to which the foreskin is embryonically homologous. 
Preputioplasty is the most common foreskin reconstruction technique, most often done when a boy is born with a foreskin that is too small;[1]: 177 a similar procedure is performed to relieve a tight foreskin without resorting to circumcision.[30]: 181 
The foreskin of adults is typically retractable over the glans. 
Coverage of the glans in a flaccid and erect state varies depending on foreskin length. The foreskin is attached to the glans at birth and is generally not retractable in infancy. Inability to retract the foreskin in childhood should not be considered a problem unless there are other symptoms.[2] The highly innervated mucocutaneous zone of the penis occurs near the tip of the foreskin. 
For newborns, it may be done for religious requirements or personal preferences surrounding hygiene and aesthetics.[31]: 257 Circumcision may also be performed on children or adults to treat phimosis, balanitis, or to prevent transmission of sexually transmitted infections.[32]: 166 The ethics of circumcision in children is a source of controversy.[33][34][35] As of 2012, no successful technique to reconstruct a circumcised foreskin had been published.[30]: 181 Some men have used weights to stretch the skin of the penis to regrow a foreskin; the resulting tissue does cover the glans but does not replicate the features of a foreskin.[36] 
Other cultural or aesethetic practices include genital piercings involving the foreskin and slitting the foreskin.[37] 
Foreskins obtained from circumcision procedures are frequently used by biochemical and micro-anatomical researchers to study the structure and proteins of human skin. In particular, foreskins obtained from newborns have been found to be useful in the manufacturing of more human skin.[38] 
Foreskins of babies are also used for skin graft tissue,[39][40][41] and for β-interferon-based drugs.[42] 
Foreskin-derived fibroblasts have been used in biomedical research,[43] and cosmetic applications.[44] 
The foreskin may become subject to a number of pathological conditions.[3] Most conditions are rare and are easily treated. 
In some cases, particularly with chronic conditions, treatment may include circumcision, a procedure where the foreskin is partially or completely removed. 
In ancient Greece, foreskins were valued, especially prepuces that were longer in length.[45] The earliest known illustrative depiction of the foreskin dates back to Egyptian kingdoms.[46] The foreskin can be seen depicted in art from different ages. 
The outside of the foreskin is a continuation of the skin on the shaft of the penis, but the inner foreskin is a mucous membrane like the inside of the eyelid or the mouth. 
The mucocutaneous zone occurs where the outer and inner foreskin meet. Like the eyelid, the foreskin is free to move after it separates from the glans, which usually occurs before or during puberty. The foreskin is attached to the glans by a frenulum, a highly vascularized tissue of the penis.[4] The World Health Organization states that "[t]he frenulum forms the interface between the outer and inner foreskin layers, and when the penis is not erect, it tightens to narrow the foreskin opening.[4] 
The area of the outer foreskin measures 7–100 cm2,[8] and the inner foreskin measures 18–68 cm.2[9] 
Circumcision is the removal of the foreskin from the human penis.[1][2] In the most common procedure the foreskin is extended with forceps (in pre-pubescent children its normal adhesion to the glans must also be broken with a probe), then a circumcision device may be placed, after which the foreskin is excised. 
Topical or locally injected anesthesia is often used to reduce pain and physiologic stress.[3] The procedure is usually an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons.[4] Medically, circumcision is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis and balanoposthitis that do not resolve with other treatments, and for chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs).[5][6] It is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.[1][6] 
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most commonly transmitted sexually transmitted infection, affecting both men and women. While most infections are asymptomatic and are cleared by the immune system, some types of the virus cause genital warts, and other types, if untreated, cause various forms of cancer, including cervical cancer, and penile cancer. Genital warts and cervical cancer are the two most common problems resulting from HPV.[45] 
The Holy Prepuce, or Holy Foreskin (Latin præputium or prepucium), is one of several relics attributed to Jesus, a product of the circumcision of Jesus. At various points in history, a number of churches in Europe have claimed to possess Jesus's foreskin, sometimes at the same time. 
Various miraculous powers have been ascribed to it. 
Mary Dzon says that for many people during the Medieval period, devotion to the Holy Prepuce reflected a focus on the humanity of Jesus.[4] 
According to Farley, "Depending on what you read, there were eight, twelve, fourteen, or even 18 different holy foreskins in various European towns during the Middle Ages."[1] In addition to the Holy Foreskin of Rome (later Calcata), other claimants included the Cathedral of Le Puy-en-Velay, Santiago de Compostela, the city of Antwerp, Coulombs in the diocese of Chartres, as well as Chartres itself, and churches in Besançon, Metz, Hildesheim, Charroux.[9] Conques, Langres, Fécamp, and two in Auvergne. 
A special chapel was constructed and processions organised in honour of the miraculous relic, which became the goal of pilgrimages. In 1426 a brotherhood was founded in the cathedral "van der heiliger Besnidenissen ons liefs Heeren Jhesu Cristi in onser liever Vrouwen Kercke t' Antwerpen"; its 24 members were all abbots and prominent laymen. The relic disappeared in 1566, but the chapel still exists, decorated by two stained glass windows donated by king Henry VII of England and his wife Elizabeth of York in 1503.[citation needed] 
In the early 12th century, it was taken in procession to Rome where it was presented before Pope Innocent III, who was asked to rule on its authenticity. The Pope declined the opportunity. At some point, however, the relic went missing, and remained lost until 1856 when a workman repairing the abbey claimed to have found a reliquary hidden inside a wall, containing the missing foreskin. 
According to Farley, the Second Vatican Council later removed the Day of the Holy Circumcision from the Latin church calendar, although Eastern Catholics and Traditional Roman Catholics still celebrate the Feast of the Circumcision of Our Lord on January 1.[6][10] In reality, it was more than two years before 11 October 1962, the date when the Second Vatican Council began, that a 25 July 1960 decree of Pope John XXIII[11] enacted a wide-ranging revision of the General Roman Calendar, which included changing the name of the 1 January feast from "Circumcision of the Lord and Octave of the Nativity" to "Octave of the Nativity", with no change of the Gospel reading about the circumcision of the child Jesus.[12] 
In the Italian village of Calcata, a reliquary containing the supposed Holy Foreskin was paraded through the streets as recently as 1983 on the Feast of the Circumcision, which was formerly marked by the Roman Catholic Church around the world on January 1 each year. The practice ended, however, when thieves stole the jewel-encrusted case, contents and all.[1] Following this theft, it is unclear whether any of the purported Holy Prepuces still exist. 
In a 1997 television documentary for Channel 4, British journalist Miles Kington travelled to Italy in search of the Holy Foreskin, but was unable to find any remaining example. On December 22, 2013 National Geographic Channel broadcast a documentary starring Farley called "The Quest for the Holy Foreskin".[13] 
According to an unconfirmed 19th-century source,[14][15] in the late 17th century the Vatican librarian Leo Allatius wrote an unpublished[16] treatise entitled De Praeputio Domini Nostri Jesu Christi Diatriba (A Discussion of the Foreskin of Our Lord Jesus Christ), claiming that the Holy Prepuce ascended, like Jesus himself, and was transformed into the rings of Saturn. 
In 2009, Farley's An Irreverent Curiosity: In Search of the Church's Strangest Relic in Italy's Oddest Town was published.[18] 
In The Gospel According To Jesus Christ, José Saramago writes that anyone "wishing to venerate that foreskin today need only visit the parish church of Calcata near Viterbo in Italy, where it is preserved in a reliquary for the spiritual benefit of the faithful and the amusement of prying atheists."[19] 
All Jewish boys are required by Jewish law to be circumcised on the eighth day following their birth; the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ, still celebrated by many churches around the world, accordingly falls on January 1. Luke 2:21 (King James Version), reads: "And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb."[1] The first reference to the survival of Christ's severed foreskin comes in the second chapter of the apocryphal Arabic Infancy Gospel which contains the following story: 
And when the time of his circumcision was come, namely, the eighth day, on which the law commanded the child to be circumcised, they circumcised him in a cave. 
And the old Hebrew woman took the foreskin (others say she took the navel-string), and preserved it in an alabaster-box of old oil of spikenard. 
And she had a son who was a druggist, to whom she said, "Take heed thou sell not this alabaster box of spikenard-ointment, although thou shouldst be offered three hundred pence for it." 
Now this is that alabaster-box which Mary the sinner procured, and poured forth the ointment out of it upon the head and feet of our Lord Jesus Christ, and wiped it off with the hairs of her head.[2] 
David Farley recounts how the foreskin was then looted during the Sack of Rome in 1527. 
The German soldier who stole it was captured in the village of Calcata, 47 km north of Rome, later the same year. Housed in Calcata, it was venerated from that time onwards, with the Church approving the authenticity by offering a ten-year indulgence to pilgrims. Pilgrims, nuns and monks flocked to the church, and "Calcata [became] a must-see destination on the pilgrimage map." 
The foreskin was reported stolen by a local priest in 1983.[1] 
However, in 1905, Pope Pius X authorized an inventory compiled by Professor Hartmann Grisar, of the University of Innsbruck.[7] Grisar's report corresponds to the earlier Descriptio laternansis Ecclesia. 
The gold cross was dated to between the sixth and eighth centuries. Grisar's study stated that, like Pope Paschal's enameled silver reliquary cross, the gold jeweled cross was clearly initially designed to hold a relic of the True Cross. This is further supported by the statement in the Descriptio relating it to a procession on the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross. 
The Vita of Pope Sergius I (687-01) mentions both the Feast of the Exaltation, the jeweled cross, and veneration of the relic contained therein.[8] Grisar attributed the reference to the foreskin and umbilicus as derived from later Medieval traditions. The gold cross was lost in 1945.[3] 
The lower lip is formed from the mandibular prominence, a branch of the first pharyngeal arch. The lower lip covers the anterior body of the mandible. It is lowered by the depressor labii inferioris muscle and the orbicularis oris borders it inferiorly. 
Lips are soft, movable, and serve as the opening for food intake and in the articulation of sound and speech. Human lips are a tactile sensory organ, and can be an erogenous zone when used in kissing and other acts of intimacy. 
Lip size is linked to sexual attraction in both men and women. Women are attracted to men with masculine lips, that are more middle size and not too big or too small; they are to be rugged and sensual. In general, the researchers found that a small nose, big eyes and voluptuous lips are sexually attractive both in men and women.[10] The lips may temporarily swell during sexual arousal due to engorgement with blood.[medical citation needed] 
The lips contribute substantially to facial expressions. The lips visibly express emotions such as a smile or frown, iconically by the curve of the lips forming an up-open or down-open parabola, respectively. Lips can also be made pouty when whining, or perky to be provocative. 
Lips are often viewed as a symbol of sensuality and sexuality. This has many origins; above all, the lips are a very sensitive erogenous and tactile organ. Furthermore, in many cultures of the world, a woman's mouth and lips are veiled because of their representative association with the vulva, and because of their role as a woman's secondary sexual organ.[17] 
Lip piercing or lip augmentation is sometimes carried out for cosmetic reasons. Products designed for use on the lips include lipstick, lip gloss and lip balm. 
Because of this, the blood vessels appear through the skin of the lips, which leads to their notable red coloring. With darker skin color this effect is less prominent, as in this case the skin of the lips contains more melanin and thus is visually darker. The skin of the lip forms the border between the exterior skin of the face, and the interior mucous membrane of the inside of the mouth. 
The lip skin is not hairy and does not have sweat glands. Therefore, it does not have the usual protection layer of sweat and body oils which keep the skin smooth, inhibit pathogens, and regulate warmth. For these reasons, the lips dry out faster and become chapped more easily. 
Ndendeule is a Bantu language of Tanzania. Speakers are mostly monolingual. 
The Yoruba dialect continuum itself consists of several dialects. The various Yoruba dialects in the Yorubaland of Nigeria can be classified into five major dialect areas: Northwest, Northeast, Central, Southwest and Southeast.[10] Clear boundaries cannot be drawn, peripheral areas of dialectal regions often having some similarities to adjoining dialects. 
North-West Yoruba is historically a part of the Ọyọ Empire. In NWY dialects, Proto-Yoruba velar fricative /ɣ/ and labialized voiced velar /gʷ/ have merged into /w/; the upper vowels /ɪ/ and /ʊ/ were raised and merged with /i/ and /u/, just as their nasal counterparts, resulting in a vowel system with seven oral and three nasal vowels. 
Èdè Yorùbá; Ajami: عِدعِ يوْرُبا‎) is a language spoken in West Africa, most prominently Southwestern Nigeria. It is spoken by the ethnic Yoruba people. The number of Yoruba speakers is stated as roughly 50 million, plus about 2 million second-language speakers.[1] As a pluricentric language, it is primarily spoken in a dialectal area spanning Nigeria with smaller migrated communities in Cote d'Ivoire, Sierra Leone and The Gambia. 
Literary Yoruba, also known as Standard Yoruba, Yoruba koiné, and common Yoruba, is a separate member of the dialect cluster. It is the written form of the language, the standard variety learned at school and that spoken by newsreaders on the radio. Standard Yoruba has its origin in the 1850s, when Samuel A. Crowther, the first native African Anglican bishop, published a Yoruba grammar and started his translation of the Bible. 
Though for a large part based on the Ọyọ and Ibadan dialects, Standard Yoruba incorporates several features from other dialects.[12] It also has some features peculiar to itself, for example, the simplified vowel harmony system, as well as foreign structures, such as calques from English which originated in early translations of religious works. 
The three possible syllable structures of Yoruba are consonant+vowel (CV), vowel alone (V), and syllabic nasal (N). Every syllable bears one of the three tones: high ⟨◌́⟩, mid ⟨◌̄⟩ (generally left unmarked), and low ⟨◌̀⟩. The sentence n̄ ò lọ (I didn't go) provides examples of the three syllable types: 
Yoruba is a tonal language with three-level tones and two or three contour tones. Every syllable must have at least one tone; a syllable containing a long vowel can have two tones. Tones are marked by use of the acute accent for high tone (⟨á⟩, ⟨ń⟩) and the grave accent for low tone (⟨à⟩, ⟨ǹ⟩); mid is unmarked, except on syllabic nasals where it is indicated using a macron (⟨a⟩, ⟨n̄⟩). 
Written Yoruba includes diacritical marks not available on conventional computer keyboards, requiring some adaptations. In particular, the use of the sub dots and tone marks are not represented, so many Yoruba documents simply omit them. Asubiaro Toluwase, in his 2014 paper,[21] points out that the use of these diacritics can affect the retrieval of Yoruba documents by popular search engines. 
Yoruba is a highly isolating language.[23] Its basic constituent order is subject–verb–object,[24] as in ó nà Adé 'he beat Adé'. 
The bare verb stem denotes a completed action, often called perfect; tense and aspect are marked by preverbal particles such as ń 'imperfect/present continuous', ti 'past'. Negation is expressed by a preverbal particle kò. Serial verb constructions are common, as in many other languages of West Africa. 
Yoruba is classified among the Edekiri languages, which together with Itsekiri and the isolate Igala form the Yoruboid group of languages within the Volta–Niger branch of the Niger–Congo family. The linguistic unity of the Niger–Congo family dates to deep prehistory, estimates ranging around 11000 years ago (the end of the Upper Paleolithic).[8] In present-day Nigeria, it is estimated that there are over 40 million Yoruba primary and secondary language speakers as well as several other millions of speakers outside Nigeria, making it the most widely spoken African language outside of the continent. 
Among commonly Arabic words used in Yoruba are names of the days such as Atalata (الثلاثاء) for Tuesday, Alaruba (الأربعاء) for Wednesday, Alamisi (الخميس) for Thursday, and Jimoh (الجمعة, Jumu'ah) for Friday. By far Ọjọ́ Jimoh is the most favorably used. 
It is usually referred to as the unpleasant word for Friday, Ẹtì, which means failure, laziness, or abandonment.[29][better source needed] Ultimately, the standard words for the days of the week are Àìkú, Ajé, Ìṣẹ́gun, Ọjọ́rú, Ọjọ́bọ, Ẹtì, Àbámẹ́ta, for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday respectively. 
Friday remains Eti in the Yoruba language. 
Hausa (/ˈhaʊsə/;[4] Harshen/Halshen Hausa; Ajami: هَرْشَن هَوْسَ‎) is a Chadic language spoken by the Hausa people, mainly within the northern half of Nigeria and the southern half of Niger, and with significant minorities in Chad, Benin, and Cameroon.[5][6] 
Hausa presents a wide uniformity wherever is spoken. However, linguists have identified dialect areas with a cluster of features characteristic of each one.[11] 
Eastern Hausa dialects include Dauranci in Daura, Kananci in Kano, Bausanci in Bauchi, Gudduranci in Katagum Misau and part of Borno, and Hadejanci in Hadejiya.[12] 
Western Hausa dialects include Sakkwatanci in Sokoto, Katsinanci in Katsina, Arewanci in Gobir, Adar, Kebbi, and Zamfara, and Kurhwayanci in Kurfey in Niger. 
Katsina is transitional between Eastern and Western dialects. Sokoto is used in a variety of classical Hausa literature, and is often known as Classical Hausa.[13] 
The Daura (Dauranchi) and Kano (Kananci) dialect are the standard. The BBC, Deutsche Welle, Radio France Internationale and Voice of America offer Hausa services on their international news web sites using Dauranci and Kananci. In recent language development Zazzaganci took over the innovation of writing and speaking the current Hausa language use. 
The western to eastern Hausa dialects of Kurhwayanci, Damagaram and Aderawa, represent the traditional northernmost limit of native Hausa communities. These are spoken in the northernmost sahel and mid-Saharan regions in west and central Niger in the Tillaberi, Tahoua, Dosso, Maradi, Agadez and Zinder regions. While mutually comprehensible with other dialects (especially Sakkwatanci, and to a lesser extent Gaananci), the northernmost dialects have slight grammatical and lexical differences owing to frequent contact with the Zarma, Fula, and Tuareg groups and cultural changes owing to the geographical differences between the grassland and desert zones. 
Hausa is a member of the Afroasiatic language family and is the most widely spoken language within the Chadic branch of that family. Ethnologue estimated that it was spoken as a first language by some 47 million people and as a second language by another 25 million, bringing the total number of Hausa speakers to an estimated 72 million.[7] According to more recent estimations, Hausa would be spoken by 100–150 million people.[8] 
The Ghanaian Hausa dialect (Gaananci), spoken in Ghana and Togo, is a distinct western native Hausa dialect-bloc with adequate linguistic and media resources available. Separate smaller Hausa dialects are spoken by an unknown number of Hausa further west in parts of Burkina Faso, and in the Haoussa Foulane, Badji Haoussa, Guezou Haoussa, and Ansongo districts of northeastern Mali (where it is designated as a minority language by the Malian government), but there are very little linguistic resources and research done on these particular dialects at this time. 
Hausa is also spoken in various parts of Cameroon and Chad, which combined the mixed dialects of Northern Nigeria and Niger. In addition, Arabic has had a great influence in the way Hausa is spoken by the native Hausa speakers in these areas. 
There are several pidgin forms of Hausa. 
Barikanchi was formerly used in the colonial army of Nigeria. Gibanawa is currently in widespread use in Jega in northwestern Nigeria, south of the native Hausa area.[17] 
The three-way contrast between palatalized velars /c ɟ cʼ/, plain velars /k ɡ kʼ/, and labialized velars /kʷ ɡʷ kʷʼ/ is found only before long and short /a/, e.g. /cʼaːɽa/ ('grass'), /kʼaːɽaː/ ('to increase'), /kʷʼaːɽaː/ ('shea-nuts'). 
Before front vowels, only palatalized and labialized velars occur, e.g. /ciːʃiː/ ('jealousy') vs. /kʷiːɓiː/ ('side of body'). 
Before rounded vowels, only labialized velars occur, e.g. /kʷoːɽaː/ ('ringworm').[18][19] 
They are written with modified versions of Latin letters. They can also be denoted with an apostrophe, either before or after depending on the letter, as shown below. 
Hausa is a tonal language. 
Each of its five vowels may have low tone, high tone or falling tone. In standard written Hausa, tone is not marked. In recent linguistic and pedagogical materials, tone is marked by means of diacritics. 
An acute accent (´) may be used for high tone, but the usual practice is to leave high tone unmarked. 
Native speakers of Hausa, the Hausa people, are mostly found in Niger, in Northern Nigeria, Northern Cameroon, and in Chad.[1][2][10] Furthermore, the language is used as a lingua franca by non-native speakers in most of Northern Nigeria and Southern Niger, and as a trade language across a much larger swathe of West Africa (Benin, Ghana, Cameroon, Togo, Chad and parts of Sudan).[5] 
Penile cancer is cancer that develops in the skin or tissues of the penis. Symptoms may include abnormal growth, an ulcer or sore on the skin of the penis, and bleeding or foul smelling discharge.[2] 
Penile cancer arises from precursor lesions, which generally progress from low-grade to high-grade lesions. For HPV related penile cancers this sequence is as follows:[1] 
Risk factors include phimosis (inability to retract foreskin of the penis), chronic inflammation, smoking, HPV infection, condylomata acuminate, having multiple sexual partners, and early age of sexual intercourse.[3] 
Around 95% of penile cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. They are classified into the following types:[citation needed] 
Other types of carcinomas are rare and may include small cell, Merkel cell, clear cell, sebaceous cell or basal cell tumors. Non-epithelial malignancies such as melanomas and sarcomas are even more rare.[1] 
It is usually a primary malignancy, the initial place from which a cancer spreads in the body. Much less often it is a secondary malignancy, one in which the cancer has spread to the penis from elsewhere. The staging of penile cancer is determined by the extent of tumor invasion, nodal metastasis, and distant metastasis.[22] 
The T portion of the AJCC TNM staging guidelines are for the primary tumor as follows:[1] 
Anatomic Stage or Prognostic Groups of penile cancer are as follows:[1] 
Around 95% of penile cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Other types of penile cancer such as Merkel cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and melanoma are generally rare.[4] In 2018, it occurred in 34,000 men and caused 15,000 deaths.[1] 
Human papillomavirus prevalence in penile cancers is high at about 40%. 
HPV16 is the predominant genotype accounting for approximately 63% of HPV-positive tumors. Among warty/basaloid cancers the HPV prevalence is 70–100% while in other types it is around 30%.[1] 
HPV vaccines such as Gardasil or Cervarix may reduce the risk of HPV and, consequently, penile cancer.[1][2] The use of condoms is thought to be protective against the HPV associated penile cancer.[4] Good genital hygiene, which involves washing the penis, the scrotum, and the foreskin daily with water, may prevent balanitis and penile cancer. 
However, soaps with harsh ingredients should be avoided.[citation needed] Cessation of smoking may reduce the risk of penile cancer.[3] Circumcision during infancy or in childhood may provide partial protection against penile cancer. 
Several authors have proposed circumcision as a possible strategy for penile cancer prevention;[4][14][23] however, the American Cancer Society points to the rarity of the disease and notes that neither the American Academy of Pediatrics nor the Canadian Academy of Pediatrics recommend routine neonatal circumcision.[5] Phimosis can be prevented by practising proper hygiene and by retracting the foreskin on a regular basis.[medical citation needed] Paraphimosis can be prevented by not leaving the foreskin retracted for prolonged periods of time.[medical citation needed] 
Treatment of penile cancer will vary depending on the clinical stage of the tumor at the time of diagnosis.[24] There are several treatment options for penile cancer, depending on staging. They include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and biological therapy. The most common treatment is one of five types of surgery: 
The role of radiation therapy includes an organ-sparing approach for early-stage penile cancer at specialized centres. Furthermore, adjuvant therapy is used for patients with locally advanced disease or for symptom management.[25] 
Prognosis can range considerably for patients, depending where on the scale they have been staged. Generally speaking, the earlier the cancer is diagnosed, the better the prognosis. The overall 5-year survival rate for all stages of penile cancer is about 50%.[1] 
Signs and symptoms 
Penile cancer is a rare cancer in developed nations with annual incidence varying from 0.3 to 1 per 100,000 per year accounting for around 0.4–0.6% of all malignancies.[1] The annual incidence is approximately 1 in 100,000 men in the United States,[26] 1 in 250,000 in Australia,[27] and 0.82 per 100,000 in Denmark.[28] In the United Kingdom, fewer than 500 men are diagnosed with penile cancer every year.[13][29] 
However, in the developing world penile cancer is much more common. For instance, in Paraguay, Uruguay, Uganda and Brazil the incidence is 4.2, 4.4, 2.8 and 1.5–3.7 per 100,000, respectively.[1][2] In some South American countries, Africa, and Asia, this cancer type constitutes up to 10% of malignant diseases in men.[4] 
Penile cancer can present as redness and irritation on the penis with a skin thickening on the glans or inner foreskin or an ulcerative, outward growing (exophytic) or “finger-like” (papillary) growth.[5][6] Penile cancer may accompany penile discharge with or without difficulty or burning or tingling while urinating (dysuria) and bleeding from the penis.[5][6] 
HIV infection—HIV-positive men have eight-fold increased risk of developing penile cancer than HIV-negative men.[7][8] Human papillomavirus—HPV is a risk factor in the development of penile cancer.[3] According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HPV is responsible for about 800 (about 40%) of 1,570 cases of penile cancer diagnosed annually in the United States.[10][11] There are more than 120 types of HPV.[12] Genital warts—Genital or perianal warts increase the risk of invasive penile cancer by about 3.7 times if they occurred more than two years before the reference date.[9] About half of men with penile cancer also have genital warts, which are caused by HPV.[7] 
Since its decline in popularity around 2011, it has seen a recent upsurge making it now the second most popular piercing amongst young women aged 18-25 in 2019. It remains unpopular amongst men. Standard tongue piercings, or one hole in the center of the tongue, is the most common and safest way to have the tongue pierced.[citation needed] 
Tongues are pierced with straight barbell style jewelry. Because of the frequent movement of the tongue, jewellery size and comfort is especially important. 
Barbells that are too thin are prone to migration, causing discomfort and irritation. Tongue piercings can often be easily stretched to accommodate larger jewellery. The initial piercing is often at 14 g (1.6 mm), but to avoid one or two stretching steps it is possible to pierce immediately at 12 g (2.0 mm) or even 10 g (2.4 mm). 
The beads at the end of the barbell can be made of many decorative materials. "No-see-um beads", flat beads matching the color of the tongue, are sometimes worn to conceal this piercing, often in places of employment. Using appropriate colored and styled jewellery, and taking care while talking/laughing, it is possible to conceal the piercing. 
The piercer will check the underside of the tongue for large blood vessels, sometimes with a bright light, and mark a safe placement for the piercing. The tongue is then clamped with forceps and pierced with a needle, usually from top to bottom with a piercing needle or from bottom to top with a cannula needle. 
Initial jewelry should always be considerably longer than will ultimately be required to allow for the swelling, which is common following the piercing. Within two days of getting the piercing the tongue can swell up to double its original size. This can lead to pain when speaking and eating, but this is not permanent. 
Piercers often recommend drinking cold beverages and sucking on crushed ice to help reduce the swelling. Some people find that taking Ibuprofen or similar anti-inflammatory drugs can greatly reduce the swelling associated with a tongue piercing. It is advisable not to drink alcohol, smoke or eat spicy food until the piercing is at least partially healed (around two weeks), and alcohol-free mouthwash should be used after eating or smoking. 
The traditional placement for a tongue piercing is along the midline of the tongue, in the center of the mouth. It is often approximately .76 inches (1.9 cm) or so back from the tip of the tongue. It is placed with the top a little further back than the bottom, which allows the top of the jewelry to lean slightly back, away from the teeth, and toward the higher part of the upper palate where there is more room in the mouth. 
It is also usually positioned just in front of the attachment of the lingual frenulum.[2] 
Documented complications of tongue piercings have included blood-borne infections causing brain and heart abscesses (with some deaths); hepatitis B and C, HIV, tuberculosis, and tetanus infections; swelling of the tongue causing airway obstruction, swallowing or choking on loose jewelry, damage to gums and broken teeth. Common complaints include pain, scars, excessive salivation and damage to tooth enamel.[3] 
You may face the problems of speech impediments after having a tongue piercing. Like a double tongue piercing may restrict independent tongue mobility. There is also a risk of sensation loss.[4] 
Oral trauma, i.e., dental fracture and wear affects 14% to 41% of subjects with tongue ornaments.[5] Recession of gingival tissue affects 19% to 68% of subjects with tongue ornaments.[5][6] The alveolar tooth-bearing bone may also be involved, jeopardizing the stability and durability of the teeth in place and requiring a periodontal regeneration surgery.[7] Higher prevalence of colonization of Candida albicans was reported in young individuals with tongue piercing, in comparison to non-tongue-pierced matched individuals.[8] 
Body piercing Lip piercing Tongue frenulum piercing 
The tongue piercing is not gender specific - it was not created specifically for just a man or just a woman. Popular names for tongue piercing include tongue ring, which is a misnomer, as only rarely are rings worn in tongue piercings. 
There is a history of ritual tongue piercing in both Aztec and Maya cultures, with illustrations of priests piercing their tongue and then either drawing blood from it or passing through rough cords designed to inflict pain. There is no evidence of permanent or long term tongue piercing in Aztec culture, however; despite the practice of many other permanent body modifications, it was done to honor the gods. 
Piercing the tongue has a long history in religious and performance practices. Mesoamericans such as the Aztecs practiced this as well as other perforations as a part of offerings to their deities. Asian Spirit Mediums of the Far East practiced tongue piercing as an offering and proof of trance state.[1] 
Permanent or long term piercing of the tongue is part of the resurgence of body piercing in contemporary society. The ready availability of high quality, surgical steel barbell style jewelry is associated with the emergence of this piercing in the 1980s. As with many piercing innovations, the origin of this piercing is associated with Gauntlet, the first professional body piercing studio in the United States, formerly located in Los Angeles, California. 
In Genesis 24:22, Abraham's servant gave Rebecca a nose ring. Nose piercing has been practiced by the Bedouin tribes of the Middle East and the Berber and Beja peoples of Africa,[22] as well as Australian Aboriginals.[23] Many Native American and Alaskan tribes practiced septum piercing. 
It was popular among the Aztecs, the Mayans and the tribes of New Guinea, who adorned their pierced noses with bones and feathers to symbolize wealth and (among men) virility.[3] The name of the Nez Perce tribe was derived from the practice, though nose piercing was not common within the tribe.[24] The Aztecs, Mayans and Incas wore gold septum rings for adornment, with the practice continued to this day by the Kuna of Panama.[22] Nose piercing also remains popular in Pakistan and Bangladesh and is practiced in a number of Middle Eastern and Arab countries.[22] 
In some Pre-Columbian and North American cultures, labrets were seen as a status symbol.[30] They were the oldest form of high status symbol among the Haida women, though the practice of wearing them died out due to Western influence.[31] 
Body piercing, which is a form of body modification, is the practice of puncturing or cutting a part of the human body, creating an opening in which jewelry may be worn, or where an implant could be inserted. 
The word piercing can refer to the act or practice of body piercing, or to an opening in the body created by this act or practice. It can also, by metonymy, refer to the resulting decoration, or to the decorative jewelry used. 
Piercing implants alter body and/or skin profile and appearance (e.g. golden threads installed subdermal, platinum, titanium or medical grade steel subdermal implants). 
Although the history of body piercing is obscured by popular misinformation and by a lack of scholarly reference, ample evidence exists to document that it has been practiced in various forms by multiple sexes since ancient times throughout the world. 
The history of nipple piercing, navel piercing, and genital piercing has been particularly misrepresented by printed works continuing to repeat myths that were originally promulgated by Malloy in the pamphlet Body & Genital Piercing in Brief.[1][2] For example, according to Malloy's colleague Jim Ward, Malloy claimed navel piercing was popular among ancient Egyptian aristocrats and was depicted in Egyptian statuary,[4] a claim that is widely repeated.[33][34] Other sources say there are no records to support a historical practice for navel piercing.[35] 
A screen shot from "Cryin'", featuring Alicia Silverstone and body piercer Paul King.[1] 
The practice of body piercing is subject to trends and fashions. Belly button and eyebrow piercings were popular during the 1990s when the piercing trend entered the mainstream. In recent years, the septum piercing and nipple piercing are considered highly fashionable.[61][62][63][64] Additionally, the practice of ear lobe gauging or stretching has become popular with the turn of the century.[65] 
Piercing combined with suspension was historically important in the religious ceremonies of some Native Americans, featuring in many variants of the Sun Dance ceremony,[42] including that practiced by the Crow Nation.[74] During the Crow ceremony, men who wished to obtain visions were pierced in the shoulders or chest by men who had undergone the ceremony in the past and then suspended by these piercings from poles in or outside of the Sun Dance Lodge. Some contemporary Southeast Asian rituals also practice body piercing, as a form of spiritual self-mortification. Generally, the subject attempts to enter an analgesic trance prior to the piercing.[75] 
Contemporary body piercing practices emphasize the use of safe body piercing materials, frequently utilizing specialized tools developed for the purpose. Body piercing is an invasive procedure with some risks, including allergic reaction, infection, excessive scarring and unanticipated physical injuries, but such precautions as sanitary piercing procedures and careful aftercare are emphasized to minimize the likelihood of encountering serious problems. The healing time required for a body piercing may vary widely according to placement, from as little as a month for some genital piercings to as much as two full years for the navel. 
Some piercings may be more complicated, leading to rejection. 
Body adornment has only recently become a subject of serious scholarly research by archaeologists, who have been hampered in studying body piercing by a scarcity of primary sources.[1] Early records rarely discussed the use of piercings or their meaning, and while jewellery is common among grave goods, the deterioration of the flesh that it once adorned makes it difficult to discern how the jewellery may have been used.[1] Also, the modern record has been vitiated with the 20th-century inventions of piercing enthusiast Doug Malloy.[1] In the 1960s and 1970s, Malloy marketed contemporary body piercing by giving it the patina of history.[2] His pamphlet Body & Genital Piercing in Brief included such commonly reproduced urban legends as the notion that Prince Albert invented the piercing that shares his name in order to diminish the appearance of his large penis in tight trousers, and that Roman centurions attached their capes to nipple piercings.[3][4] Some of Malloy's myths are reprinted as fact in subsequently published histories of piercing.[1] 
In this, and many later contexts, the reference is specifically Christian, alluding to members of the Ordo Virginum (Order of Virgins), which applies to the consecrated virgins known to have existed since the early church from the writings of the Church Fathers.[15] 
These are three of the eighteen definitions of virgin from the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED1, pages 230–232). Most of the OED1 definitions, however, are similar. 
The concept of virginity has significance only in a particular social, cultural or moral context. According to Hanne Blank, "virginity reflects no known biological imperative and grants no demonstrable evolutionary advantage."[1] 
Medieval bestiaries stated that the only way to capture or tame a unicorn was by way of using a virgin as a lure, due to her implied purity.[20] The topic is popular in Renaissance paintings. 
The urge of wanting one's spouse or partner to have never engaged in sexual activities is called a virgin complex. A person may also have a virgin complex directed towards oneself.[22][23][24] 
Virginity is the state of a person who has never engaged in sexual intercourse.[1][2] There are cultural and religious traditions that place special value and significance on this state, predominantly towards unmarried females, associated with notions of personal purity, honor, and worth. 
Traditionally, there was a cultural expectation that a female would not engage in premarital sex and would come to her wedding a virgin and that she would "give up" her virginity to her new husband in the act of consummation of the marriage. Feminine sexual practices have revolved around the idea of females waiting to have sex until they are married.[40] 
Like chastity, the concept of virginity has traditionally involved sexual abstinence. The concept of virginity usually involves moral or religious issues and can have consequences in terms of social status and in interpersonal relationships.[3][4] Although virginity has social implications and had significant legal implications in some societies in the past, it has no legal consequences in most societies today. 
Virginity is regarded as a valuable commodity in some cultures. 
In the past, within most societies a woman's options for marriage were largely dependent upon her status as a virgin. Those women who were not virgins experienced a dramatic decrease in opportunities for a socially advantageous marriage, and in some instances the premarital loss of virginity eliminated their chances of marriage entirely.[44] Modern virginity auctions, like that of Natalie Dylan, are discussed in the 2013 documentary How to Lose Your Virginity. 
The Bible required a man who seduced or raped a virgin to pay her bride price to her father and marry the girl.[45] In some countries, until the late 20th century, a woman could sue a man who had taken her virginity but did not marry her. 
In some languages, the compensation for these damages are called "wreath money".[46] 
Some cultures require proof of a bride's virginity before her marriage. This has traditionally been tested by the presence of an intact hymen,[1] which was verified by either a physical examination (usually by a physician, who provided a "certificate of virginity") or by a "proof of blood," which refers to vaginal bleeding that results from the tearing of the hymen after the first sanctioned sexual contact.[48][49][50] In some cultures, the nuptial blood-spotted bed sheet would be displayed as proof of both consummation of marriage and that the bride had been a virgin.[49][50] Coerced medical virginity tests are practiced in many regions of the world, but are today condemned as a form of abuse of women. 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO): "Sexual violence encompasses a wide range of acts including (...) violent acts against the sexual integrity of women, including female genital mutilation and obligatory inspections for virginity".[51] 
There is a common belief that some women are born without a hymen,[52][53] but some doubt has been cast on this by a recent study.[54] It is likely that almost all women are born with a hymen, but not necessarily ones that will experience a measurable change during first experience of vaginal intercourse. Some medical procedures occasionally may require a woman's hymen to be opened (hymenotomy). 
The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa)[1] is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit. 
The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products such as candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others. 
By the 16th century, references of cultivation of the strawberry became more common. People began using it for its supposed medicinal properties and botanists began naming the different species. In England the demand for regular strawberry farming had increased by the mid-16th century. 
The combination of strawberries and cream was created by Thomas Wolsey in the court of King Henry VIII.[5] Instructions for growing and harvesting strawberries showed up in writing in 1578. By the end of the 16th century three European species had been cited: F. vesca, F. moschata, and F. viridis. The garden strawberry was transplanted from the forests and then the plants would be propagated asexually by cutting off the runners. 
Duchesne determined F. ananassa to be a hybrid of F. chiloensis and F. virginiana. 
F. ananassa, which produces large fruits, is so-named because it resembles the pineapple in smell, taste and berry shape. In England, many varieties of F. ananassa were produced, and they form the basis of modern varieties of strawberries currently cultivated and consumed. Further breeding were also conducted in Europe and America to improve the hardiness, disease resistance, size, and taste of strawberries.[1] 
The garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s via a cross of Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America and Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought from Chile by Amédée-François Frézier in 1714.[2] Cultivars of Fragaria × ananassa have replaced, in commercial production, the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca), which was the first strawberry species cultivated in the early 17th century.[3] 
Strawberries are often grouped according to their flowering habit.[1][8] Traditionally, this has consisted of a division between "June-bearing" strawberries, which bear their fruit in the early summer and "ever-bearing" strawberries, which often bear several crops of fruit throughout the season.[8] One plant throughout a season may produce 50 to 60 times or roughly once every three days.[3] 
Research published in 2001 showed that strawberries actually occur in three basic flowering habits: short-day, long-day, and day-neutral. These refer to the day-length sensitivity of the plant and the type of photoperiod that induces flower formation. Day-neutral cultivars produce flowers regardless of the photoperiod.[10] 
Strawberry cultivars vary widely in size, color, flavor, shape, degree of fertility, season of ripening, liability to disease and constitution of plant.[7] On average, a strawberry has about 200 seeds on its external membrane.[11] Some vary in foliage, and some vary materially in the relative development of their sexual organs. In most cases, the flowers appear hermaphroditic in structure, but function as either male or female.[12] 
For purposes of commercial production, plants are propagated from runners and, in general, distributed as either bare root plants or plugs. Cultivation follows one of two general models—annual plasticulture,[13] or a perennial system of matted rows or mounds.[14] Greenhouses produce a small amount of strawberries during the off season.[15] 
The other major method, which uses the same plants from year to year growing in rows or on mounds, is most common in colder climates.[1][2] It has lower investment costs, and lower overall maintenance requirements.[14] Yields are typically lower than in plasticulture.[14] 
Strawberries may also be propagated by seed, though this is primarily a hobby activity, and is not widely practiced commercially. A few seed-propagated cultivars have been developed for home use, and research into growing from seed commercially is ongoing.[19] Seeds (achenes) are acquired either via commercial seed suppliers, or by collecting and saving them from the fruit. 
Strawberries can also be grown indoors in strawberry pots.[20] Although the plant may not naturally grow indoors in the winter, use of LED lighting in combination of blue and red light can allow the plant to grow during the winter.[21] Additionally, in certain areas like the state of Florida, winter is the natural growing season where harvesting starts in mid-November.[9] 
The strawberry is not, from a botanical point of view, a berry. Technically, it is an aggregate accessory fruit, meaning that the fleshy part is derived not from the plant's ovaries but from the receptacle that holds the ovaries.[4] Each apparent "seed" (achene) on the outside of the fruit is actually one of the ovaries of the flower, with a seed inside it.[4] 
The Kashubian strawberry (Truskawka kaszubska or Kaszëbskô malëna)[22] is the first Polish fruit to be given commercial protection under EU law. It is produced in Kartuzy, Kościerzyna and Bytów counties and in the municipalities of Przywidz, Wejherowo, Luzino, Szemud, Linia, Łęczyce and Cewice in Kashubia. Only the following varieties may be sold as kaszëbskô malëna: Senga Sengana, Elsanta, Honeoye that have been graded as Extra or Class I.[citation needed] 
The berries are picked with the caps still attached and with at least half an inch of stem left. Strawberries need to remain on the plant to fully ripen because they do not continue to ripen after being picked. Rotted and overripe berries are removed to minimize insect and disease problems. 
There are normally adequate levels of phosphorus and potash when fields have been fertilized for top yields. To provide more organic matter, a cover crop of wheat or rye is planted in the winter before planting the strawberries. Strawberries prefer a pH from 5.5 to 6.5, so lime is usually not applied.[25] 
The harvesting and cleaning process has not changed substantially over time. The delicate strawberries are still harvested by hand.[26] Grading and packing often occurs in the field, rather than in a processing facility.[26] In large operations, strawberries are cleaned by means of water streams and shaking conveyor belts. 
The first garden strawberry was grown in Brittany, France, during the late 18th century.[1] Prior to this, wild strawberries and cultivated selections from wild strawberry species were the common source of the fruit. 
Many common language terms used for fruit and seeds differ from botanical classifications. 
For example, in botany, a fruit is a ripened ovary or carpel that contains seeds; e.g., an apple or a pomegranate — or a tomato (see Venn diagram). 
A nut is a type of fruit (and not a seed), and a seed is a ripened ovule.[1] In culinary language, a fruit, so-called, is the sweet- or not sweet- (even sour-) tasting produce of a specific plant (e.g., a peach, pear or lemon); nuts are hard, oily, non-sweet plant produce in shells (hazelnut, acorn). 
Vegetables, so called, typically are savory or non-sweet produce (zucchini, lettuce, broccoli, and tomato); but some may be sweet-tasting (sweet potato).[5] 
Examples of botanically classified fruit that typically are called vegetables include: cucumber, pumpkin, and squash (all are cucurbits); beans, peanuts, and peas (all legumes); corn, eggplant, bell pepper (or sweet pepper), and tomato, (see image). 
The spices chili pepper and allspice are fruits, botanically speaking.[4] In contrast, rhubarb is often called a fruit when used in making pies, but the edible produce of rhubarb is actually the leaf stalk or petiole of the plant.[6] Edible gymnosperm seeds are often given fruit names, e.g., ginkgo nuts and pine nuts. 
Botanically, a cereal grain, such as corn, rice, or wheat is a kind of fruit (termed a caryopsis). However, the fruit wall is thin and fused to the seed coat, so almost all the edible grain-fruit is actually a seed.[7] 
In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants that is formed from the ovary after flowering. 
Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate their seeds. Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.[1] Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings. 
In common language usage, "fruit" normally means the fleshy seed-associated structures (or produce) of plants that typically are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries. In botanical usage, the term "fruit" also includes many structures that are not commonly called "fruits", such as nuts, bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains.[2][3] 
The onion plant (Allium cepa), also known as the bulb onion[7] or common onion,[3]: 9-10 is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium.[8][9] It was first officially described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work Species Plantarum.[10] A number of synonyms have appeared in its taxonomic history: 
Allium cepa var. aggregatum – G. Don Allium cepa var. bulbiferum – Regel Allium cepa var. cepa – Linnaeus Allium cepa var. multiplicans – L.H. Bailey Allium cepa var. proliferum – (Moench) Regel Allium cepa var. solaninum – Alef Allium cepa var. viviparum – (Metz) Mansf.[11][12] 
The onion (Allium cepa L., from Latin cepa "onion"), also known as the bulb onion or common onion, is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium. The shallot is a botanical variety of the onion. Until 2010, the shallot was classified as a separate species.[2][3]: 21 
Its close relatives include the garlic, scallion, leek, chive,[4] and Chinese onion.[5] 
This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food, such as the Japanese bunching onion (Allium fistulosum), the tree onion (A. ×proliferum), and the Canada onion (Allium canadense). 
The name "wild onion" is applied to a number of Allium species, but A. cepa is exclusively known from cultivation. Its ancestral wild original form is not known, although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions.[6] The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant, but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season. 
The onion plant has a fan of hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are composed of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle. 
The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the onion fly, the onion eelworm, and various fungi which can cause rotting. Some varieties of A. cepa, such as shallots and potato onions, produce multiple bulbs. 
The livers of polar bears, walruses, bearded seals, moose, and huskies can contain very high levels of preformed vitamin A,[7][8] and their consumption has led to vitamin A poisoning (hypervitaminosis A) according to several anecdotal reports and a few scientific studies.[citation needed] The Inuit will not eat the liver of polar bears or bearded seals. It has been estimated that consumption of 500 grams of polar bear liver would result in a toxic dose for a human.[9] Russian sailor Alexander Konrad, who accompanied explorer Valerian Albanov in a tragic ordeal over the Arctic ice in 1912, wrote about the awful effects of consuming polar bear liver.[10] Also, in 1913, Antarctic explorers on the Far Eastern Party Douglas Mawson and Xavier Mertz were believed to have been poisoned, the latter fatally, from eating husky liver, though this has been contested recently.[11] 
Mercury content in some species can also be an issue. In 2012, the Government of Nunavut warned pregnant women to lower their intake of ringed seal liver due to elevated levels of mercury.[12] 
The neurotoxin in the liver of the pufferfish (which is consumed in Japanese cuisine as fugu, tightly regulated by Japanese law) contains the highest concentration of the tetrodotoxin, which characterizes the species. Consequently, the liver has been illegal to serve since 1984. 
The liver of mammals, fowl, and fish is commonly eaten as food by humans (see offal). 
Domestic pig, lamb, calf, ox, chicken, goose, and cod livers are widely available from butchers and supermarkets while stingray and burbot livers are common in some European countries. 
Animal livers are rich in iron, copper, the B vitamins and preformed vitamin A. It is unsure if daily consumption of liver can be harmful, as no conclusive research has been done on the toxicity of preformed vitamin A from food. A single serving of beef liver exceeds the tolerable upper intake level of vitamin A.[1] 100 g cod liver contains 5 mg of vitamin A and 100 µg of vitamin D.[2] 
From Middle English liver, from Old English lifer, from Proto-Germanic *librō, from Proto-Indo-European *leyp- “to smear, smudge, stick”, from Proto-Indo-European *ley- “to be slimy, be sticky, glide”. Cognate with Saterland Frisian Lieuwer “liver”, West Frisian lever “liver”, Dutch lever “liver”, German Leber “liver”, Danish , Norwegian and Swedish language lever “liver” the last three from Old Norse lifr “liver”. 
In the Romance languages, the anatomical word for "liver" (French foie, Italian fegato, Spanish hígado, etc.) derives not from the Latin anatomical term, jecur, but from the culinary term ficatum, literally "stuffed with figs," referring to the livers of geese that had been fattened on figs (foie gras).[3] 
Preparation 
Liver can be baked, boiled, broiled, fried, stir-fried, or eaten raw (asbeh nayeh or sawda naye in Lebanese cuisine, liver sashimi). 
In many preparations, pieces of liver are combined with pieces of meat or kidneys, like in the various forms of Middle Eastern mixed grill (e.g. meurav Yerushalmi). 
Spreads or pâtés made from liver have various names, including liver pâté, pâté de foie gras, chopped liver, liverwurst, liver spread, and Braunschweiger. Other liver sausages include mazzafegato or salsiccia matta. A traditional South African delicacy, namely skilpadjies, is made of minced lamb's liver wrapped in netvet (caul fat), and grilled over an open fire. 
It is used to prepare delicacies, such as poached skate liver on toast in England,[4] as well as the beignets de foie de raie and foie de raie en croute in French cuisine.[5] Cod liver (usually tinned in its oil and served seasoned) is a popular spread for bread or toast in several European countries. 
Burbot and its liver are a traditional winter food.[6] 
In many Christian traditions, chastity is synonymous with purity. Chastity means "the successful integration of sexuality within the person and thus the inner unity of man in his bodily and spiritual being“,[8] which could according to one's marital status either mean to have no sexual relationship or not having any sexual relations outside marriage. It also means fidelity to husband or wife during marriage. 
In Western Christian morality, chastity is placed opposite the deadly sin of lust, and is classified as one of seven virtues. The moderation of sexual desires is required to be virtuous. Reason, will, and desire can harmoniously work together to do what is good. 
As an emblem of inward chastity, some Christians choose to wear a purity ring or a girdle such as the Cord of Saint Thomas; the purity ring is ordinarily worn before Holy Matrimony for those called to married life or for lifetime in cases where one is called to the vocation of single life.[9][10] 
In marriage, the spouses commit to a lifelong relationship that excludes sexual intimacy with other persons. A third form of chastity, often called "vidual chastity", is expected of a woman for a period after her husband dies. For example, Anglican Bishop Jeremy Taylor defined 5 rules in Holy Living (1650), including abstaining from marrying "so long as she is with child by her former husband" and "within the year of mourning".[11] 
In the Roman Catholic Church, celibacy is vowed or promised as one of the evangelical counsels by the persons of the consecrated life. Furthermore, in 306, the Synod of Elvira proscribed clergy from marrying. This was unevenly enforced until the Second Lateran Council in 1139 and found its way into Canon law. 
Chastity, also known as purity, is a virtue related to temperance.[1] Someone who is chaste refrains either from sexual activity considered immoral or any sexual activity,[2][3] according to their state of life. In some contexts, for example when making a vow of chastity, chastity would mean the same as celibacy. 
Vows of chastity can be taken either as part of an organised religious life (such as Roman Catholic Beguines and Beghards in the past) or on an individual basis: as a voluntary act of devotion, or as part of an ascetic lifestyle (often devoted to contemplation), or both. 
Some Protestant religious communities, such as the Bruderhof, take vows[12] of chastity as part of the church membership process.[13] 
Chastity is a central and pivotal concept in Roman Catholic praxis. Chastity's importance in traditional Roman Catholic teaching stems from the fact that it is regarded as essential in maintaining and cultivating the unity of body with spirit and thus the integrity of the human being.[14]: 2332 It is also regarded as fundamental to the practise of the Catholic life because it involves an apprenticeship in self-mastery.[15]: 2339 By attaining mastery over one's passions, reason, will, and desire can harmoniously work together to do what is good. 
The theology of the body of the Lutheran Churches emphasizes the role of the Holy Spirit, who has sanctified the bodies of Christians to be God's temple.[16] 
Mormonism 
"Physical intimacy between husband and wife is a beautiful and sacred part of God's plan for His children. 
It is an expression of love within marriage and allows husband and wife to participate in the creation of life. God has commanded that this sacred power be expressed only between a man and a woman who are legally married. 
The law of chastity applies to both men and women. 
It includes strict abstinence from sexual relations before marriage and complete fidelity and loyalty to one's spouse after marriage. 
"The law of chastity requires that sexual relations be reserved for marriage between a man and a woman. 
"In addition to reserving sexual intimacy for marriage, we obey the law of chastity by controlling our thoughts, words, and actions. Jesus Christ taught,"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: but I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart" (Matthew 5:27–28)."[17] 
Etymology 
"And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our Angel, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man. She said, "Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, [so leave me], if you should be fearing of Allah." 
He said, "I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you [news of] a pure boy." 
She said, "How can I have a boy while no man has touched me and I have not been unchaste?"" (19:17-20) 
"And those who do not invoke with Allah another deity or kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed], except by right, and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse. 
And whoever should do that will meet a penalty. 
Multiplied for him is the punishment on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein humiliated -Except for those who repent, believe and do righteous work. For them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good. 
And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful." (25:68-70) 
The words chaste and chastity stem from the Latin adjective castus ("cut off", "separated", "pure"). The words entered the English language around the middle of the 13th century. Chaste meant "virtuous", "pure from unlawful sexual intercourse") or (from the early 14th century on) as a noun, a virgin,[4][5] while chastity meant "(sexual) purity".[5][6] 
"But let them who find not [the means for] marriage abstain [from sexual relations] until Allah enriches them from His bounty. And those who seek a contract [for eventual emancipation] from among whom your right hands possess - then make a contract with them if you know there is within them goodness and give them from the wealth of Allah which He has given you. And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek [thereby] the temporary interests of worldly life. 
Chastity is mandatory in Islam. 
Sex outside legitimacy is prohibited, for both men and women whether married or unmarried. 
The injunctions and forbiddings in Islam apply equally to men and women. 
The legal punishment for adultery is equal for men and women. 
Social hypocrisy in many societies over history had led to a double standard when considering sin committed by men versus sin committed by women. Society tended to be more lenient and permissive towards men forgiving men for sins not forgivable when women do them. 
The prophet's prescription to the youth was: 
Those of you who own the means should marry for this should keep their eyes uncraving and their chastity secure. Those who don't, may practise fasting for it curbs desire. " 
(Ibn Massoud) 
In Islam it is both a personal and a social value. A Muslim society should not condone relations entailing or conducive to sexual license. Social patterns and practices calculated to inflame sexual desire are frowned upon by Islam, such incitements to immorality including permissive ideologies, titillating works of art and the failure to inculcate sound moral principles in the young. 
At the heart of such a view of human sexuality lies the conviction that the notion of personal freedom should never be misconstrued as the freedom to flout God's laws by overstepping the bounds which, in His infinite wisdom, He has set upon the relations of the sexes. 
Chastity is highly prized in the Baháʼí Faith. Similar to other Abrahamic religions, Baháʼí teachings call for the restriction of sexual activity to that between a wife and husband in Baháʼí marriage, and discourage members from using pornography or engaging in sexually explicit recreational activities. The concept of chastity is extended to include avoidance of alcohol and mind-altering drugs, profanity, and gaudy or immodest attire.[18] 
Hinduism's view on premarital sex is rooted in its concept of Ashrama (stage) or the stages of life. The first of these stages, known as Brahmacharya, roughly translates as chastity. Celibacy and chastity are considered the appropriate behavior for both male and female students during this stage, which precedes the stage of the married householder (Grihastha). 
In Sikhism, premarital or extra-marital sex is strictly forbidden. However, it is encouraged to marry and live as a family unit to provide and nurture children for the perpetual benefit of creation (as opposed to sannyasa or living as a monk, which was, and remains, a common spiritual practice in India). A Sikh is encouraged not to live as a recluse, beggar, monk, nun, celibate, or in any similar vein. 
Chastity (Bhramacharya) is one of the five major vows of Jainism. The general Jain code of ethics requires that one do no harm to any living being in thought, action, or word. Adultery is clearly a violation of a moral agreement with one's spouse, and therefore forbidden, and fornication too is seen as a violation of the state of chastity. 
The teachings of Buddhism include the Noble Eightfold Path, comprising a division called right action. Under the Five Precepts ethical code, Upāsaka and Upāsikā lay followers should abstain from sexual misconduct, while Bhikkhu and Bhikkhuni monastics should practice strict chastity. 
For many Jews, Christians, and Muslims, acts of sexual nature are restricted to marriage. For unmarried persons, chastity is equivalent to sexual abstinence. Sexual acts outside or apart from marriage, such as adultery, fornication, and prostitution, are considered immoral due to lust. 
The doctrines of Mormonism began with the farmboy Joseph Smith in the 1820s in western New York during a period of religious excitement known as the Second Great Awakening.[10] After praying about which denomination he should join, Smith said he received a vision in the spring of 1820.[11] Called the "First Vision", Smith said that God the Father and his son Jesus Christ appeared to him and instructed him to join none of the existing churches because they were all wrong.[12] During the 1820s Smith chronicled several angelic visitations, and was eventually told that God would use him to re-establish the true Christian church. 
With the assistance of Martin Harris, an early follower, Smith began dictating the text of the Book of Mormon on April 12, 1828. Although translation was interrupted by persecution, Smith's continued employment in order to support his family, and Harris's loss of 116 pages, the Book of Mormon manuscript was finished in June 1829.[13] Smith said the plates were returned to the angel after he finished the translation. During the time Smith said he possessed the plates, 15 people were allowed to witness their existence. 
The Book of Mormon claims to be a chronicle of early Israelites who left the Near East and traveled to the Americas. The book begins with the story of the departure of Lehi's (a prophet) family from Jerusalem at the urging of God c. 
600 BC, and later sailing to the Americas c. 589 BC. 
The people of the Americas are recorded as having had a belief in Christ hundreds of years before his birth, witnessing Christ's personal visitation to them after his resurrection, and eventually losing Christianity after generations of wars and apostasy. 
The Book of Mormon and continuing revelations would be the means of establishing correct doctrine for the restored church. Smith, Oliver Cowdery, and other early followers began baptizing new converts in 1829 and formally organized in 1830 as the Church of Christ.[14] Smith was seen by his followers as a modern-day prophet.[15] 
In orthodox Mormonism, the term God generally refers to the biblical God the Father, whom Latter Day Saints refer to as Elohim,[25][26][27] and the term Godhead refers to a council of three distinct divine persons consisting of God the Father, Jesus Christ (his firstborn Son, whom Latter Day Saints refer to as Jehovah), and the Holy Ghost.[25][27] Latter Day Saints believe that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are three distinct beings, and that the Father and Jesus have perfected, glorified, physical bodies, while the Holy Ghost is a spirit without a physical body.[25][28][29] Latter Day Saints also believe that there are other gods and goddesses outside the Godhead, such as a Heavenly Mother—who is the wife of God the Father—and that faithful Latter-day Saints may attain godhood in the afterlife.[30] Joseph Smith taught that God was once a man on another planet before being exalted to Godhood.[31] 
This conception differs from the traditional Christian Trinity in several ways, one of which is that Mormonism has not adopted or continued to hold the doctrine of the Nicene Creed, that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are of the same substance or being.[1] Also, Mormonism teaches that the intelligence dwelling in each human is coeternal with God.[32] Mormons use the term omnipotent to describe God, and regard him as the creator: they understand him as being almighty and eternal but subject to eternal natural law which governs intelligences, justice and the eternal nature of matter (ie God organized the world but did not create it from nothing).[33] The Mormon conception of God also differs substantially from the Jewish tradition of ethical monotheism in which elohim (אֱלֹהִים) is a completely different conception. 
This description of God represents the Mormon orthodoxy, formalized in 1915 based on earlier teachings. Other currently existing and historical branches of Mormonism have adopted different views of god, such as the Adam–God doctrine and Trinitarianism. 
Mormonism describes itself as falling within world Christianity, but as a distinct restored dispensation; it characterizes itself as the only true form of the Christian religion since the time of a Great Apostasy that began not long after the ascension of Jesus Christ.[34] According to Mormons this apostasy involved the corruption of the pure, original Christian doctrine with Greek and other philosophies,[35] and followers dividing into different ideological groups.[36] Additionally, Mormons claim the martyrdom of the Apostles led to the loss of Priesthood authority to administer the Church and its ordinances.[37][38] 
Mormons believe that God re-established the early Christian Church as found in the New Testament through Joseph Smith.[39] In particular, Mormons believe that angels such as Peter, James, John, and John the Baptist appeared to Joseph Smith and others and bestowed various Priesthood authorities on them.[40] Mormons thus believe that their Church is the "only true and living church" because divine authority was restored to it through Smith. 
In addition, Mormons believe that Smith and his legitimate successors are modern prophets who receive revelation from God to guide the church. They maintain that other religions have a portion of the truth and are guided by the light of Christ.[41][42] 
Smith's cosmology is laid out mostly in Smith's later revelations and sermons, but particularly the Book of Abraham, the Book of Moses, and the King Follett discourse.[43] Mormon cosmology presents a unique view of God and the universe, and places a high importance on human agency. 
In Mormonism, life on earth is just a short part of an eternal existence. Mormons believe that in the beginning, all people existed as spirits or "intelligences," in the presence of God.[44] In this state, God proposed a plan of salvation whereby they could progress and "have a privilege to advance like himself."[45] The spirits were free to accept or reject this plan, and a "third" of them, led by Satan rejected it.[46] The rest accepted the plan, coming to earth and receiving bodies with an understanding that they would experience sin and suffering. 
Mormonism is the religious tradition and theology of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity started by Joseph Smith in Western New York in the 1820s and 1830s. As a label, Mormonism has been applied to various aspects of the Latter Day Saint movement, although there has been a recent push from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to distance themselves from this label. 
A historian, Sydney E. Ahlstrom, wrote in 1982, "One cannot even be sure, whether [Mormonism] is a sect, a mystery cult, a new religion, a church, a people, a nation, or an American subculture; indeed, at different times and places it is all of these".[1][2] However, scholars and theologians within the Latter Day Saint movement, including Smith, have often used "Mormonism" to describe the unique teachings and doctrines of the movement.[3] 
In Mormonism, the central part of God's plan is the atonement of Jesus Christ.[47] Mormons believe that one purpose of earthly life is to learn to choose good over evil. In this process, people inevitably make mistakes, becoming unworthy to return to the presence of God. Mormons believe that Jesus paid for the sins of the world and that all people can be saved through his atonement.[48] Mormons accept Christ's atonement through faith, repentance, formal covenants or ordinances such as baptism, and consistently trying to live a Christ-like life. 
Mormon theology teaches that the United States is a unique place and that Mormons are God's chosen people, selected for a singular destiny. The Book of Mormon alludes to the United States as being the Biblical promised land, with the Constitution of the United States being divinely inspired, and argues that America is an exceptional nation.[49] 
In Upstate New York in 1823, Joseph Smith claimed to have had a vision in which the Angel Moroni told him about engraved golden plates buried in a nearby hill.[50][51] According to Smith, he received subsequent instruction from Moroni and, four years later, excavated the plates and translated them from "reformed Egyptian" into English; the resultant Book of Mormon–so called after an ancient American prophet who, according to Smith, had compiled the text recorded on the golden plates–recounts the history of a tribe of Israelites, led by the prophet Lehi, who migrated from Jerusalem to the Americas in the 7th century BCE.[50][51] In Mormonism, these Israelite tribes who migrated to the Americas centuries before the birth of Jesus Christ are considered to be among the ancestors of pre-Columbian Native Americans.[50][51] 
Joseph Smith argued that the millennial New Jerusalem was to be built in America (10th Article of Faith).[1] In the Doctrine and Covenants, Smith records God as saying "it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another. 
And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood" (D&C 101:79–80). 
To Mormons, this places America as the originator of religious liberty and freedom, while noting a need to expand these American values worldwide.[52] 
Although officially shunned by the LDS Church, fundamentalist Mormons believe in the White Horse Prophecy, which argues that Mormons will be called upon to preserve the Constitution as it hangs "by a thread".[53][54] 
In Mormonism, an ordinance is a religious ritual of special significance, often involving the formation of a covenant with God.[55] Ordinances are performed by the authority of the priesthood and in the name of Jesus Christ. The term has a meaning roughly similar to that of the term "sacrament" in other Christian denominations. 
Mormon theology centers on the Book of Mormon, which describes itself as a chronicle of early indigenous peoples of the Americas and their dealings with God.[4] Mormon theology includes mainstream Christian beliefs with modifications stemming from revelations to Smith and other religious leaders. This includes the use of and belief in the Bible, and other religious texts including the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price. Mormonism includes significant doctrines of eternal marriage, eternal progression, baptism for the dead, polygamy or plural marriage as authorized by God, sexual purity, health (specified in the Word of Wisdom), fasting, and Sabbath observance. 
In Mormonism, the saving ordinances are seen as necessary for salvation, but they are not sufficient in and of themselves. For example, baptism is required for exaltation, but simply having been baptized does not guarantee any eternal reward. The baptized person is expected to be obedient to God's commandments, to repent of any sinful conduct subsequent to baptism, and to receive the other saving ordinances. 
Because Mormons believe that everyone must receive certain ordinances to be saved, Mormons perform ordinances on behalf of deceased persons.[57] These ordinances are performed vicariously or by "proxy" on behalf of the dead. In accordance with their belief in each individual's "free agency", living or dead, Mormons believe that the deceased may accept or reject the offered ordinance in the spirit world, just as all spirits decided to accept or reject God's plan originally. In addition, these "conditional" ordinances on behalf of the dead are performed only when a deceased person's genealogical information has been submitted to a temple and correctly processed there before the ordinance ritual is performed. 
Only ordinances for salvation are performed on behalf of deceased persons. 
Mormons believe in the Old and New Testaments, and the LDS Church uses the King James Bible as its official scriptural text of the Bible. While Mormons believe in the general accuracy of the modern day text of the Bible, they also believe that it is incomplete and that errors have been introduced.[58][59][60] In Mormon theology, many lost truths are restored in the Book of Mormon, which Mormons hold to be divine scripture and equal in authority to the Bible.[61] 
The Mormon scriptural canon also includes a collection of revelations and writings contained in the Doctrine and Covenants which contains doctrine and prophecy and the Pearl of Great Price which addresses briefly Genesis to Exodus. These books, as well as the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible, have varying degrees of acceptance as divine scripture among different denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement. 
The theology itself is not uniform; as early as 1831, and most significantly after Smith's death, various groups split from the Church of Christ that Smith established.[5] Other than differences in leadership, these groups most significantly differ in their stances on polygamy, which the Utah-based LDS Church banned in 1890, and Trinitarianism, which the LDS Church does not affirm. The branch of theology which seeks to maintain the practice of polygamy is known as Mormon fundamentalism and includes several different churches.[6] Other groups affirm Trinitarianism, such as the Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), and describe their doctrine as Trinitarian Christian restorationist.[7] 
In Mormonism, continuous revelation is the principle that God or his divine agents still continue to communicate to mankind. This communication can be manifest in many ways: influences of the Holy Ghost (the principal form in which this principle is manifest), visions, visitations of divine beings, and others. 
Joseph Smith used the example of the Lord's revelations to Moses in Deuteronomy to explain the importance of continuous revelation: 
Mormons believe that Smith and subsequent church leaders could speak scripture "when moved upon by the Holy Ghost."[63] In addition, many Mormons believe that ancient prophets in other regions of the world received revelations that resulted in additional scriptures that have been lost and may, one day, be forthcoming. In Mormonism, revelation is not limited to church members. For instance, Latter Day Saints believe that the United States Constitution is a divinely inspired document.[64] 
Mormons are encouraged to develop a personal relationship with the Holy Ghost and receive personal revelation for their own direction and that of their family.[1] The Latter Day Saint concept of revelation includes the belief that revelation from God is available to all those who earnestly seek it with the intent of doing good. 
It also teaches that everyone is entitled to personal revelation with respect to his or her stewardship (leadership responsibility). Thus, parents may receive inspiration from God in raising their families, individuals can receive divine inspiration to help them meet personal challenges, church officers may receive revelation for those whom they serve. 
The important consequence of this is that each person may receive confirmation that particular doctrines taught by a prophet are true, as well as gain divine insight in using those truths for their own benefit and eternal progress. In the church, personal revelation is expected and encouraged, and many converts believe that personal revelation from God was instrumental in their conversion.[65] 
Mormons see Jesus Christ as the premier figure of their religion.[66] 
Mormonism categorizes itself within Christianity, and nearly all Mormons self-identify as Christian.[67][68][69] For some who define Christianity within the doctrines of Catholicism, Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy, the Churches of the East, and Protestantism, Mormonism's differences place it outside the umbrella of Christianity.[70][71][72] 
Mormons believe in Jesus Christ as the literal Son of God and Messiah, his crucifixion as a conclusion of a sin offering, and subsequent resurrection.[76] However, Latter-day Saints (LDS) reject the ecumenical creeds and the definition of the Trinity.[77][78] (In contrast, the second-largest Latter Day Saint denomination, the Community of Christ, is Trinitarian and monotheistic.) 
Mormons hold the view that the New Testament prophesied both the apostasy from the teachings of Christ and his apostles as well as the restoration of all things prior to the second coming of Christ.[79] 
Some notable differences with mainstream Christianity include: A belief that Jesus began his atonement in the garden of Gethsemane and continued it to his crucifixion, rather than the orthodox belief that the crucifixion alone was the physical atonement;[80] and an afterlife with three degrees of glory, with hell (often called spirit prison) being a temporary repository for the wicked between death and the resurrection.[81] Additionally, Mormons do not believe in creation ex nihilo, believing that matter is eternal, and creation involved God organizing existing matter.[82] 
Much of the Mormon belief system is geographically oriented around the North and South American continents. Mormons believe that the people of the Book of Mormon lived in the western hemisphere, that Christ appeared in the western hemisphere after his death and resurrection, that the true faith was restored in Upstate New York by Joseph Smith, that the Garden of Eden was located in North America, and that the New Jerusalem would be built in Missouri. For this and other reasons, including a belief by many Mormons in American exceptionalism, Molly Worthen speculates that this may be why Leo Tolstoy described Mormonism as the "quintessential 'American religion'".[83] 
Although Mormons do not claim to be part of Judaism, Mormon theology claims to situate Mormonism within the context of Judaism to an extent that goes beyond what most other Christian denominations claim. The faith incorporates many Old Testament ideas into its theology, and the beliefs of Mormons sometimes parallel those of Judaism and certain elements of Jewish culture. In the earliest days of Mormonism, Joseph Smith taught that the Indigenous peoples of the Americas were members of some of the Lost Tribes of Israel. 
Members of the LDS Church receive Patriarchal blessings which declare the recipient's lineage within one of the tribes of Israel. The lineage is either through true blood-line or adoption. The LDS Church teaches that if one is not a direct descendant of one of the twelve tribes, upon baptism he or she is adopted into one of the tribes. 
Brigham Young named a tributary of the Great Salt Lake the "Jordan River". The LDS Church created a writing scheme called the Deseret Alphabet, which was based, in part, on Hebrew. The LDS Church has a Jerusalem Center in Israel, where students focus their study on Near Eastern history, culture, language, and the Bible.[84] 
There has been some controversy involving Jewish groups who see the actions of some elements of Mormonism as offensive. In the 1990s, Jewish groups vocally opposed the LDS practice of baptism for the dead on behalf of Jewish victims of the Holocaust and Jews in general. According to LDS Church general authority Monte J. Brough, "Mormons who baptized 380,000 Holocaust victims posthumously were motivated by love and compassion and did not understand their gesture might offend Jews ... they did not realize that what they intended as a 'Christian act of service' was 'misguided and insensitive'".[85] Mormons believe that when the dead are baptized through proxy, they have the option of accepting or rejecting the ordinance. 
The LDS Church seeks to distance itself from other branches of Mormonism, particularly those that practice polygamy.[95] The church maintains a degree of orthodoxy by excommunicating or disciplining its members who take positions or engage in practices viewed as apostasy. For example, the LDS Church excommunicates members who practice polygamy or who adopt the beliefs and practices of Mormon fundamentalism. 
One way Mormon fundamentalism distinguishes itself from mainstream Mormonism is through the practice of plural marriage. Fundamentalists initially broke from the LDS Church after that doctrine was discontinued around the beginning of the 20th century. Mormon fundamentalism teaches that plural marriage is a requirement for exaltation (the highest degree of salvation), which will allow them to live as gods and goddesses in the afterlife. 
In distinction with the LDS Church, Mormon fundamentalists also often believe in a number of other doctrines taught and practiced by Brigham Young in the 19th century, which the LDS Church has either abandoned, repudiated, or put in abeyance. These include: 
Mormon fundamentalists believe that these principles were wrongly abandoned or changed by the LDS Church, in large part due to the desire of its leadership and members to assimilate into mainstream American society and avoid the persecutions and conflict that had characterized the church throughout its early years. Others believe that it was a necessity at some point for "a restoration of all things" to be a truly restored Church. 
Perhaps the most controversial, and a key contributing factor for Smith's murder, is the claim that plural marriage (as defenders call it) or polygamy (as critics call it) is biblically authorized. 
Under heavy pressure — Utah would not be accepted as a state if polygamy was practiced — the church formally and publicly renounced the practice in 1890. Utah's statehood soon followed. However, plural marriage remains a controversial and divisive issue, as despite the official renunciation of 1890, it still has sympathizers, defenders, and semi-secret practitioners within Mormonism, though not within the LDS Church. 
More recent criticism has focused on questions of historical revisionism, homophobia, racism,[96] sexist policies, inadequate financial disclosure, and the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon. 
The law of chastity is a moral code defined by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). According to the church, chastity means that "sexual relations are proper only between a man and a woman who are legally and lawfully wedded as husband and wife."[1] Therefore, abstinence from sexual relations before marriage, and complete fidelity to one's spouse during marriage, are required.[2] As part of the law of chastity, the church teaches its members to abstain from adultery and fornication. 
The LDS Church places great emphasis on the law of chastity. Commitment to live the law of chastity is required for baptism,[10] and adherence is required to receive a temple recommend.[11] 
The Book of Mormon teaches that sexual sins are "most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost" (Alma 39:5). Church leaders have similarly emphasized its importance. 
Activities considered a violation of the law of chastity include both adultery and fornication as well as broader behavior. While serving as church president, Kimball taught that the law of chastity encompasses "all sexual relations outside marriage—petting, sex perversion, masturbation, and preoccupation with sex in one's thoughts and talking. Included are every hidden and secret sin and all unholy and impure thoughts and practices."[15] 
Victims of rape, incest, or sexual abuse are not guilty of sin and are not considered to have broken the law of chastity.[16] However, they often feel that they have lost their virtue, which intensifies the feelings of shame and guilt experienced by many victims of rape. 
In the Book of Mormon, it states, "For behold, many of the daughters of the Lamanites have they taken prisoners; and [they] depriv[ed] them of that which was most dear and precious above all things, which is chastity and virtue".[17] In a general conference address, Richard G. Scott explained, "The victim must do all in his or her power to stop the abuse. Most often, the victim is innocent because of being disabled by fear or the power or authority of the offender. At some point in time, however, the Lord may prompt a victim to recognize a degree of responsibility for abuse. 
Within the LDS Church, chastity means more than abstinence from sex. It means to be morally clean in "thoughts, words, and actions." It also means sexual relations are only permitted between a husband and wife. 
The church teaches its members that "no one, male or female, is to have sexual relations before marriage. After marriage, sexual relations are permitted only with our spouse."[1] 
In addition, members are taught to dress modestly, to control their thoughts, and to avoid pornography.[1][2] Dressing immodestly is not a violation of the law of chastity, but "modesty promotes chastity".[16] Members who are married are instructed to "be faithful to your spouse in thought, word, and action. 
Stay away from situations where temptation may develop."[16] 
The LDS Church allows members to identify as gay and participate in temple ordinances, but bans any same-sex sexual activity.[19] 
The LDS Church teaches that same-sex sexual and romantic feelings are not a choice or sin[20] and that members should be supported in identifying with terms like gay, lesbian, or bisexual.[21] Members whose sexual orientation is not strictly heterosexual can participate in temple ordinances and remain in good standing,[22] although, for this they are not allowed to express their sexuality through dating people of the same sex. These teachings leave strictly-homosexually-oriented members with the option of entering a mixed-orientation opposite-sex marriage, or living a celibate lifestyle without any sexual expression (including masturbation).[23]: 11 
On many occasions church leaders have taught that members should not masturbate as part of obedience to the law of chastity.[24][25][26] Salient examples of this include a church guide to stop masturbating produced in the 1970s.[27][28][29][24] Another is the 1990 edition of the church's youth guidelines pamphlet which stated that the "Lord specifically forbids ... masturbation"[30] with the next two editions (including the most current one) alluding to it with statements forbidding anything that "arouses" any sexual feelings or emotions in one's "own body".[31][32] Apostle Spencer W. Kimball, who later served as church president, warned of the "possible damages" and "dangers"[33] of this "common indescretion"[34] on various occasions calling it a "reprehensible sin"[35][36] that grows "with every exercise".[37][38] 
The apostle Boyd K. Packer gave a 1976 general conference address "To Young Men Only" warning young men not to tamper with their little factory (a euphemism for their reproductive system) lest it speed up and become a guilt-and depression-inducing habit that is not easy to resist. 
He gave vigorous exercise as a method to help control thoughts and break the habit of masturbation since it is a "transgression" that is "not pleasing to the Lord".[1][39] The talk was printed as a pamphlet and widely distributed by the church from 1980 to 2016.[40] Since 1985 the church has provided a manual for parents to use in discussing sexuality with their children. The manual includes statements that "prophets have condemned [masturbation] as a sin" and "perversion of the body's passions" that causes one to "become carnal".[41] The most recent explicit mention of masturbation by top leaders in public discourse was by Tad R. Callister who stated in a 2013 speech at BYU-Idaho that God "condemns self-abuse"[42] (a euphemism for masturbation).[43] 
Members of the LDS Church believe that sexuality between man and woman lawfully married is divinely appointed and has two purposes: to "multiply, and replenish the Earth" (Genesis 1:28) as commanded by God to Adam and Eve, and to strengthen the bond between man and woman that they might "become one flesh" (Mark 10:8). A church handbook states that "[p]hysical intimacy between husband and wife is intended to be beautiful and sacred. It is ordained of God for the creation of children and for the expression of love between husband and wife. 
As part of teaching the law of chastity, LDS Church leaders have repeatedly condemned the use of sexually arousing literature[44] and visual material for decades.[45][46] 
The church has made its views clear in many publications and in recent news releases that "marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God".[4] While opposing homosexual behavior, the church advises its leaders and members to reach out with understanding and respect to individuals who are attracted to those of the same gender.[5] 
Sexual relations are deemed proper only between a man and a woman who are legally and lawfully wedded as husband and wife. Any other sexual relations, including those between persons of the same gender, are considered sinful and undermining of the divinely created institution of the family. The church accordingly affirms defining marriage as the legal and lawful union between a man and a woman.[6] 
An LDS Church publication published particularly for young men and women states: "Before marriage, do not participate in passionate kissing, lie on top of another person, or touch the private, sacred parts of another person's body, with or without clothing. Do not do anything else that arouses sexual feelings. Do not arouse those emotions in your own body.” [7] Youth are taught in church classes that sexual relations are sacred, and they should avoid "fondling of bodies, one's own or that of others".[8] Masturbation is "not condoned but is not considered homosexual".[9] 
As of 2007, 80% of all Mormon missionaries were young, single men, 13% were young single women and 7% retired couples.[1] Women who would like to serve a mission must meet the same standards of worthiness and be at least 19 years old. 
Women generally serve as missionaries for 18 months. 
Married retired couples, on the other hand, are encouraged to serve missions, but their length of service may vary from six to 36 months depending on their circumstances and means.[11] Any single retired person may also be called to serve in what is known as senior missionary service. 
In the last two decades, the LDS Church has stepped up its call for senior couple missionaries. 
All missionaries must meet certain minimum standards of worthiness. Among the standards that a prospective missionary must demonstrate adherence to are: regular attendance at church meetings, regular personal prayer, regular study of the scriptures, adherence to the law of chastity (sexual purity), adherence to the Word of Wisdom (code of health and nutrition), payment of tithing, spiritual diligence and testimony of God. 
Missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church)—widely known as Mormon missionaries—are volunteer representatives of the LDS Church who engage variously in proselytizing, church service, humanitarian aid, and community service. 
Mormon missionaries may serve on a full- or part-time basis, depending on the assignment, and are organized geographically into missions. The mission assignment could be to any one of the 399[1] missions organized worldwide. 
Newly called missionaries attend a short training period at one of 10 church Missionary Training Centers (MTCs) worldwide.[17] The largest MTC is located in Provo, Utah,[18] adjacent to Brigham Young University. Missionaries who will not be learning a language in order to serve their missions spend three weeks at an MTC where they practice using proselytizing materials, learn expected conduct, and study the scriptures. Missionaries bound for foreign-language missions spend six to nine weeks at an MTC, depending on the language to be learned. 
The basic standards of missionary service and conduct were previously contained in the Missionary Handbook.[19] The previous Missionary Handbook was commonly and informally referred to as "the white handbook" or "the white bible".[20] As of November 2019, this handbook has been replaced by two new handbooks, Missionary Standards for Disciples of Jesus Christ[21] and Missionary Standards for Disciples of Jesus Christ: Supplemental Information.[22] Missionaries are instructed that following these standards will protect them both physically and spiritually. 
Mission presidents have discretion to adjust some of the standards according to local circumstances.[19]: 1 
Full-time LDS missionaries are required to adhere to a dress code. Previously for men, this included conservative, dark trousers and suit coats, white dress shirts, and conservative ties. For women, modest and professional dresses or blouses and mid-calf length skirts were worn. 
In 2013,[23] the LDS Church updated their grooming standards. Young men were no longer required to wear dark suits or a full suit during regular everyday proselytizing activities. They must, however, remain in professional, conservative attire including a white shirt and tie. 
For instance, a light colored suit is acceptable. They are also allowed to wear a sweater or suit vest over their dress shirt and are encouraged to wear colored ties.[24] 
Sister (female) missionaries may wear skirts and dresses that cover their knees. Young women are encouraged to dress in colors and patterns, and they may wear appropriate jewelry and accessories.[25] In 2018 it was announced that female missionaries could wear dress slacks if they wanted, except when attending the temple and during Sunday worship services, baptismal services, and mission leadership and zone conferences.[26] 
In some areas these standards are altered slightly according to the discretion of the mission president. For example, in hot, humid climates, suit coats are not required, and dress shirts may be short-sleeved. Casual clothes may be worn only in limited circumstances, such as when missionaries provide manual labor or exercise.[27] 
Completing a mission is often described as a rite of passage for a young Latter-day Saint.[5][6][7][8] However, serving a mission is not necessary for continuance in church membership. 
Young men between the ages of 18 and 25 who meet standards of worthiness are strongly encouraged to consider a two-year, full-time proselytizing mission. This expectation is based in part on the New Testament passage "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations" (Matt. 28: 19–20). 
The minimum age had previously been age 19 in most countries until October 6, 2012, when Church President Thomas S. Monson announced that all male missionaries, regardless of nation, could serve from age 18.[9] Prior to the announcement, members from some countries were allowed to serve from the younger age to avoid conflict with educational or military requirements.[10] It was also announced that young women may serve beginning at age 19 instead of 21.[9] In 2007, approximately 30% of all 19-year-old LDS men became Mormon missionaries; from LDS families that are active in the church, approximately 80–90% of 19-year-old men serve a mission.[3] 
Missionaries can be sent home for violating mission rules, and occasionally missionaries choose to go home for health or various other reasons. However, the vast majority of missionaries serve the whole two-year (men) or eighteen-month (women) terms.[citation needed] 
God again commands Jonah to travel to Nineveh and prophesy to its inhabitants.[16] This time he goes and enters the city, crying, "In forty days Nineveh shall be overthrown."[17] After Jonah has walked across Nineveh, the people of Nineveh begin to believe his word and proclaim a fast.[18] The king of Nineveh puts on sackcloth and sits in ashes, making a proclamation which decrees fasting, the wearing of sackcloth, prayer, and repentance.[19] God sees their repentant hearts and spares the city at that time.[20] The entire city is humbled and broken with the people (and even the animals)[21][22] in sackcloth and ashes.[23] 
Displeased by this, Jonah refers to his earlier flight to Tarshish while asserting that, since God is merciful, it was inevitable that God would turn from the threatened calamities.[24] He then leaves the city and makes himself a shelter, waiting to see whether or not the city will be destroyed.[25] God causes a plant (in Hebrew a kikayon) to grow over Jonah's shelter to give him some shade from the sun.[26] Later, God causes a worm to bite the plant's root and it withers.[27] Jonah, now being exposed to the full force of the sun, becomes faint and pleads for God to kill him.[28] 
The Book of Jonah (Yonah יונה) is one of the twelve minor prophets included in the Tanakh. According to one tradition, Jonah was the boy brought back to life by Elijah the prophet in 1 Kings.[29][30] Another tradition holds that he was the son of the woman of Shunem brought back to life by Elisha in 2 Kings[31][32] and that he is called the "son of Amittai" (Truth) due to his mother's recognition of Elisha's identity as a prophet in 2 Kings.[33][32] The Book of Jonah is read every year, in its original Hebrew and in its entirety, on Yom Kippur – the Day of Atonement, as the Haftarah at the afternoon mincha prayer.[34][35] According to Rabbi Eliezer, the fish that swallowed Jonah was created in the primordial era[36] and the inside of its mouth was like a synagogue;[36] the fish's eyes were like windows[36] and a pearl inside its mouth provided further illumination.[36] 
Jonah is mentioned twice in the fourteenth chapter of the deuterocanonical Book of Tobit,[42] the conclusion of which finds Tobit's son, Tobias, rejoicing at the news of Nineveh's destruction by Nebuchadnezzar and Ahasuerus in apparent fulfillment of Jonah's prophecy against the Assyrian capital.[42] 
In the New Testament, Jonah is mentioned in Matthew[43] and in Luke.[44][45] In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus makes a reference to Jonah when he is asked for a sign by some of the scribes and the Pharisees.[46][47] Jesus says that the sign will be the sign of Jonah:[46][47] Jonah's restoration after three days inside the great fish prefigures His own resurrection.[46] 
Jonah or Jonas,[lower-alpha 1] son of Amittai, is a prophet in the Hebrew Bible and the Quran, from Gath-hepher of the northern kingdom of Israel in about the 8th century BCE. Jonah is the central figure of the Book of Jonah, which details his reluctance in delivering God's judgement on the city of Nineveh, and then his subsequent, albeit begrudged, return to the divine mission after he is swallowed by a large sea creature. 
Christian theologians have traditionally interpreted Jonah as a type for Jesus Christ.[55] Jonah being in swallowed by the giant fish was regarded as a foreshadowing of Jesus's crucifixion[56] and Jonah emerging from the fish after three days was seen as a parallel for Jesus emerging from the tomb after three days.[56] Saint Jerome equates Jonah with Jesus's more nationalistic side,[57] and justifies Jonah's actions by arguing that "Jonah acts thus as a patriot, not so much that he hates the Ninevites, as that he does not want to destroy his own people."[57] 
Jonah (Arabic: يُونُس‎, romanized: Yūnus) is the title of the tenth chapter of the Quran. Yūnus is traditionally viewed as highly important in Islam as a prophet who was faithful to God and delivered His messages. 
Jonah is the only one of Judaism's Twelve Minor Prophets to be named in the Quran.[1] In Quran 21:87[71] and 68:48, Jonah is called Dhul-Nūn (Arabic: ذُو ٱلنُّوْن‎; meaning "The One of the Fish").[72] In 4:163 and 6:86, he is referred to as "an apostle of Allah".[72] Surah 37:139-148 retells the full story of Jonah:[72] 
The Quran never mentions Jonah's father,[72] but Muslim tradition teaches that Jonah was from the tribe of Benjamin and that his father was Amittai.[70] 
Jonah is also mentioned in a few incidents during the lifetime of Muhammad. 
Quraysh sent their servant, Addas, to serve him grapes for sustenance.[75] Muhammad asked Addas where he was from and the servant replied Nineveh. 
"The town of Jonah the just, son of Amittai!" 
Muhammad exclaimed. 
Addas was shocked because he knew that the pagan Arabs had no knowledge of the prophet Jonah.[75] He then asked how Muhammad knew of this man. 
"We are brothers," Muhammad replied. 
"Jonah was a Prophet of God and I, too, am a Prophet of God." Addas immediately accepted Islam and kissed the hands and feet of Muhammad.[75] 
Although the creature which swallowed Jonah is often depicted in art and culture as a whale, the Hebrew text actually uses the phrase dag gadol, which means "giant fish". In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the species of the fish that swallowed Jonah was the subject of speculation for naturalists, who interpreted the story as an account of a historical incident. Some modern scholars of folklore say there are similarities between Jonah and other legendary figures, specifically Gilgamesh and the Greek hero Jason. 
Modern restoration of the Adad gate at Nineveh in a photograph taken prior to the gate's total destruction by ISIL in April 2016.[104] The Book of Jonah exaggerates the size of Nineveh far beyond what it actually was historically.[1][22] 
Photograph of a whale shark, the largest known species of fish[124] 
Joseph Campbell suggests that the story of Jonah parallels a scene from the Epic of Gilgamesh, in which Gilgamesh obtains a plant from the bottom of the sea.[147] In the Book of Jonah, a worm (in Hebrew tola'ath, "maggot") bites the shade-giving plant's root causing it to wither;[147] whereas in the Epic of Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh ties stones to his feet and plucks his plant from the floor of the sea.[147][148] Once he returns to the shore, the rejuvenating plant is eaten by a serpent.[147][149] 
Jonah is the central character in the Book of Jonah, in which God commands him to go to the city of Nineveh to prophesy against it "for their great wickedness is come up before me,"[7] but Jonah instead attempts to flee from "the presence of the Lord" by going to Jaffa (sometimes transliterated as Joppa or Joppe), and sets sail for Tarshish.[8] A huge storm arises and the sailors, realizing that it is no ordinary storm, cast lots and discover that Jonah is to blame.[9] Jonah admits this and states that if he is thrown overboard, the storm will cease.[10] The sailors refuse to do this and continue rowing, but all their efforts fail and they eventually throw Jonah overboard.[11] As a result, the storm calms and the sailors then offer sacrifices to God.[12] Jonah is miraculously saved by being swallowed by a large fish, in whose belly he spends three days and three nights.[13] While in the great fish, Jonah prays to God in his affliction and commits to giving thanks and to paying what he has vowed.[14] God then commands the fish to vomit Jonah out.[15] 
SHAREit is a peer to peer file sharing, content streaming and gaming platform that supports online and offline sharing of files and contents.[5][6][7] It allows users access to short format videos and a wide range of games making it a multimedia entertainment app for users. It works on various smartphone platforms allowing users to share files between devices directly.[8] SHAREit was developed as part of Lenovo at its initial stage but was later spun off and operated under a separate Singapore based technology company Smart Media4U Technology Pte. 
SHAREit was first released under Lenovo before its ownership was transferred to Smart Media4U Technology based in Singapore.[9][10] At its initial release, the app was only a peer to peer file sharing facilitator. SHAREit later introduced entertainment features into the app allowing users to watch videos by collaborating with entertainment providers such as Times Music.[11] On 8 May 2018, SHAREit acquired South India OTT platform Fastfilmz app and appointed the founder Karam Malhotra as the Partner & vice president of the company.[12][13] 
In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, SHAREit introduced COVID-19 tracker and video section for tracking infection and sharing of information on the spread of the virus. SHAREit has also participated in “Ingat Angat Bakuna Lahat”, a multimedia campaign in the Philippines aiming to boost vaccine confidence and speeding up economic recovery in the Philippines.[14][15][16] 
Gaming 
Following upgrade of SHAREit from peer to peer file and content sharing app, a separate gaming center was introduced into the app allowing users to play HTML5 games and gaming videos.[17][18][19] 
In 2017, Indian Defence Ministry raised security concern against 42 popular apps including SHAREit, WeChat, Mi Store, Truecaller and ordered its armed forces to uninstall all such apps from their phones and computers.[20] SHAREit refuted the allegation stating that its security metadata integration program with Google ensures that all apps transferred through SHAREit are screened by Google Play and certified malware free before allowing them to be shared between devices through SHAREit app.[21] In June 2020, Indian government announced the ban of 59 apps including SHAREit, TikTok, UC Browser, Weibo, Xender[22] as tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh sparked fatal face-off between the Indian and Chinese armies.[23][24] 
Most recently, the station came under fire from South African record executives and artists alike when YFM CEO Kanthan Pillay called a meeting and introduced a policy that had been put into place. Apparently the policy put together by the management team at YFM stipulated the station would no longer play Kwaito music chart show, which is a rap-similar genre that originated in South Africa but would replace the Kwaito chart show with the English electronic music genre, dubstep chart show. This infuriated the station's listeners and musicians alike as the move was unexpected. 
YFM listeners apparently felt that replacing staple artists like Kabelo Mabalane, Oskido, Brickz, Big Nuz, DJ Tira, DJ Cleo, DJ Black Coffee just to name a few was offensive and disrespectful to both the South African music industry and its artists at large. Some went as far as saying the station's CEO was spitting at people's faces after YFM listeners and kwaito music (which was regarded as the pillar of the station) made YFM what it is today.[3] 
YFM (99.2 FM) is a "Youth" radio station in Johannesburg, South Africa. Established in 1997, the station is formatted to mostly play urban music genres such as Kwaito, Hip Hop, and R&B along with a minority of its airtime being dedicated to talk shows. As noted by the name, the station's core audience consists of young South Africans. 
99.2 YFM is Gauteng’s leading youth radio station.[citation needed] 
YFM characterizes their core audience as "young South Africans who are imaginative, curious and ambitious. They are continuously seeking new ways to improve their lives and their communities so that they are able to lead successful and rewarding lives."[1] 
YFM describes itself as "the soundtrack to an urban life – fast-paced, energetic and uplifting with a mix of a few quiet moments so that you can catch your breath in the middle of Jozi madness." Hip-Hop, house, kwaito, and R&B form the core of YFM’s sound, with occasional rock or pop music thrown in. YFM devotes 80% of airtime to music, but the rest goes to talk radio.[1] 
YFM was one of the first venues for Kwaito artists, and the station owes much of its success to the success of Kwaito. As YFM's DJ Fresh was quoted by BBC World, "A majority of artists who are big right now - we made them they made us."[2] 
YFM started broadcasting in 1995 from the inner-city suburb of Bertrams, Johannesburg, in the face of much skepticism. Within one month of broadcasting 600,000 young South Africans had tuned into YFM. During the mid and late 2000s the number stood at over 1.2 million with more than 500,000 identifying YFM as their favorite radio station.[citation needed]. 
The numbers have since declined and as of October 2016 the listenership stood at 681, 000. The drop in numbers is linked to mass exodus of talent with DJ Mo Flava being the most recent to leave the station. 
In 1998 Yfm contributed to publishing the Y-Mag (which has been converted to a digital platform), a lifestyle magazine targeting the youth of the nation. 
In 2000, Yfm introduced its official website: YWorld.[1] The "Y" in Yfm stands for "Youth" because the station was primarily created for black youth. 
Also, X was the name of the generation fighting in the anti-apartheid period, which had trouble identifying itself in society. So "Y" represents an evolution and defines a new identity for the next generation. 
HIV/AIDS denialism in South Africa Kwaito 
The book recounts how the author, Liz McGregor, was asked while working as a freelance journalist for Poz magazine to write a story about a black celebrity infected with HIV. When Khabzela announced on the radio in April 2003 that he was infected, he seemed to make an ideal subject. McGregor interviewed him, wrote the story for Poz, and then went on to write the biography because, as she put, the story "got under my skin".[3] 
McGregor tells how Khabzela rose to fame in post-apartheid South Africa, enjoying relative fame and wealth and leading a hedonistic and promiscuous lifestyle.[4] Following his infection with HIV, Khabzela initially took antiretroviral medications but then, beset by a "bevy of faith healers and purveyors of magical drugs", he was persuaded to abandon his treatment and pursue quack remedies instead.[5] Khabzela died in January 2004.[6] 
Towards the end of the book, McGregor includes the medical records detailing Khabzela's final days. Shula Marks calls these "stark and terrifying".[7] 
Fish can be prepared in a variety of ways. It can be uncooked (raw) (e.g., sashimi). It can be cured by marinating (e.g., ceviche), pickling (e.g., pickled herring), or smoking (e.g., smoked salmon). 
Or it can be cooked by baking, frying (e.g., fish and chips), grilling, poaching (e.g., court-bouillon), or steaming. 
Many of the preservation techniques used in different cultures have since become unnecessary but are still performed for their resulting taste and texture when consumed.[citation needed] 
Globally, fish and fish products provide an average of only about 34 calories per capita per day. 
However more than as an energy source, the dietary contribution of fish is significant in terms of high-quality, easily digested animal proteins and especially in fighting micronutrient deficiencies.[1] A portion of 150g of fish provides about 50 to 60 percent of an adult's daily protein requirement. Fish proteins are essential in the diet of some densely populated countries where the total protein intake is low, and are particularly important in diets in small island developing States (SIDS).[1] 
It may be classed as either whitefish, oily fish, or shellfish. Whitefish, such as haddock and seer, contain very little fat (usually less than 1%) whereas oily fish, such as sardines, contain between 10–25%. The latter, as a result of its high fat content, contain a range of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) and essential fatty acids, all of which are vital for the healthy functioning of the body."[7] 
Many species of fish are consumed as food in virtually all regions around the world. Fish has been an important source of protein and other nutrients for humans throughout history. 
Eating oily fish containing long-chain omega-3 fatty acids may reduce systemic inflammation and lower the risk of cardiovascular disease.[8][9] Eating about (140 grams (4.9 oz)) of oily fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids twice per week is a recommended consumption amount.[8][9] Increasing intake of omega-3 fatty acids may slightly reduce the risk of a fatal heart attack,[9] but likely has little effect on the overall number of deaths from cardiovascular disease.[10] 
Fish is the most common food to obstruct the airway and cause choking. Choking on fish was responsible for about 4,500 reported accidents in the UK in 1998.[11] 
A seafood allergy is a hypersensitivity to an allergen which can be present in fish, and particularly in shellfish. 
This can result in an overreaction of the immune system and lead to severe physical symptoms.[12] Most people who have a food allergy also have a seafood allergy.[13] Allergic reactions can result from ingesting seafood, or by breathing in vapours from preparing or cooking seafood.[14] The most severe seafood allergy reaction is anaphylaxis, an emergency requiring immediate attention. 
It is treated with epinephrine.[15] 
Some species of fish, notably the puffer fugu used for sushi, and some kinds of shellfish, can result in serious poisoning if not prepared properly. 
These fish always contain these poisons as a defense against predators; it is not present due to environmental circumstances. Particularly, fugu has a lethal dose of tetrodotoxin in its internal organs and must be prepared by a licensed fugu chef who has passed the national examination in Japan. 
Ciguatera poisoning can occur from eating larger fish from warm tropical waters, such as sea bass, grouper, barracuda, and red snapper.[16] Scombroid poisoning can result from eating large oily fish which have sat around for too long before being refrigerated or frozen. This includes scombroids such as tuna and mackerel, but can also include non-scombroids such as mahi-mahi and amberjack.[16] The poison is odourless and tasteless.[2] 
Many fish eat algae and other organisms that contain biotoxins (defensive substances against predators). Biotoxins accumulated in fish/shellfish include brevetoxins, okadaic acid, saxitoxins, ciguatoxin and domoic acid. Except for ciguatoxine, high levels of these toxins are only found in shellfish. 
Both domoic acid and ciguatoxine can be deadly to humans; the others will only cause diarrhea, dizziness and a (temporary) feeling of claustrophobia.[18][19] 
English does not have a special culinary name for food prepared from these animals, as it does with pig vs. pork, and as does Spanish pescado vs. pez. In culinary and fishery contexts, fish may include shellfish, such as molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms; more expansively, seafood covers both fish and other marine life used as food.[citation needed] 
Shellfish are filter feeders and, therefore, accumulate toxins produced by microscopic algae, such as dinoflagellates and diatoms, and cyanobacteria. There are four syndromes called shellfish poisoning which can result in humans, sea mammals, and birds from the ingestion of toxic shellfish. 
These are primarily associated with bivalve molluscs, such as mussels, clams, oysters and scallops.[20] Fish like anchovies can also concentrate toxins such as domoic acid.[21] If suspected, medical attention should be sought. 
The toxins responsible for most shellfish and fish poisonings, including ciguatera and scombroid poisoning, are heat-resistant to the point where conventional cooking methods do not eliminate them.[1] 
Fish products have been shown to contain varying amounts of heavy or toxic metals. Toxicity is a function of solubility, and insoluble compounds often exhibit negligible toxicity. Organometallic forms such as dimethyl mercury and tetraethyl lead can be extremely toxic.[citation needed] 
According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the risk from mercury by eating fish and shellfish is not a health concern for most people.[37] However, certain seafood contains sufficient mercury to harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system. The FDA makes three recommendations for child-bearing women and young children: 
Do not eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish because they contain high levels of mercury. 
Eat up to 12 ounces (2 average meals) a week of a variety of fish and shellfish that are lower in mercury. 
Four of the most commonly eaten fish that are low in mercury are canned light tuna, salmon, pollock, and catfish. Another commonly eaten fish, albacore ("white tuna") has more mercury than canned light tuna. So, when choosing your two meals of fish and shellfish, you may eat up to 6 ounces (one average meal) of albacore tuna per week. 
Check local advisories about the safety of fish caught by family and friends in your local lakes, rivers, and coastal areas. If no advice is available, eat up to 6 ounces (one average meal) per week of fish you catch from local waters, but don't consume any other fish during that week. 
Since 1961, the average annual increase in global apparent food fish consumption (3.2 percent) has outpaced population growth (1.6 percent) and exceeded consumption of meat from all terrestrial animals, combined (2.8 percent) and individually (bovine, ovine, pig, other), except poultry (4.9 percent). In per capita terms, food fish consumption has grown from 9.0 kg in 1961 to 20.2 kg in 2015, at an average rate of about 1.5 percent per year.[1] The expansion in consumption has been driven not only by increased production, but also by a combination of many other factors, including reduced wastage, better utilization, improved distribution channels and growing demand, linked with population growth, rising incomes and urbanization.[1] 
When the ocean conservation organization Oceana examined over 1,200 seafood samples of seafood sold in the U.S between 2010 and 2012, they found one-third were mislabelled. The highest rate of mislabelling occurred with snapper at 87 percent, followed by tuna at 57 percent.[38] 
If fish and shellfish inhabit polluted waters, they can accumulate other toxic chemicals, particularly fat-soluble pollutants containing chlorine or bromine, dioxins or PCBs.[39] Fish that is to be eaten should be caught in unpolluted water. 
Some organisations such as SeafoodWatch, RIKILT, Environmental Defense Fund, IMARES provide information on species that do not accumulate much toxins/metals.[40][41][42][43] 
Parasites in fish are a natural occurrence and common. 
Though not a health concern in thoroughly cooked fish, parasites are a concern when consumers eat raw or lightly preserved fish such as sashimi, sushi, ceviche, and gravlax. The popularity of such raw fish dishes makes it important for consumers to be aware of this risk. 
Raw fish should be frozen to an internal temperature of −20 °C (−4 °F) for at least 7 days to kill parasites. Home freezers may not be cold enough to kill parasites.[48][49] 
Europe, Japan and the United States of America together accounted for 47 percent of the world's total food fish consumption in 1961 but only about 20 percent in 2015. Of the global total of 149 million tonnes in 2015, Asia consumed more than two-thirds (106 million tonnes at 24.0 kg per capita).[1] Oceania and Africa consumed the lowest share. 
The shift is the result of structural changes in the sector and in particular the growing role of Asian countries in fish production, as well as a significant gap between the economic growth rates of the world's more mature fish markets and those of many increasingly important emerging markets around the world, particularly in Asia.[1] 
Traditionally, fish that live all or part of their lives in fresh water were considered unsuitable for sashimi due to the possibility of parasites (see Sashimi article). Parasitic infections from freshwater fish are a serious problem in some parts of the world, particularly Southeast Asia[citation needed]. Fish that spend part of their life cycle in brackish or fresh water, like salmon, are a particular problem. 
A study in Seattle, Washington showed that 100% of wild salmon had roundworm larvae capable of infecting people. In the same study farm-raised salmon did not have any roundworm larvae.[50] 
Since fish is animal flesh, the Vegetarian Society has stated that vegetarian diets cannot contain fish.[51] 
The neologism pescetarians covers those who eat fish and other seafood, but not mammals and birds.[52] Pescatarians may consume fish based solely upon the idea that the fish are not factory farmed as land animals are (i.e., their problem is with the capitalist-industrial production of meat, not with the consumption of animal foods themselves).[53][better source needed] 
A 1999 metastudy combined data from five studies from western countries. The metastudy reported mortality ratios, where lower numbers indicated fewer deaths, for pescetarians to be 0.82, vegetarians to be 0.84, occasional meat eaters to be 0.84. Regular meat eaters and vegans shared the highest mortality ratio of 1.00. 
However, the "lower mortality was due largely to the relatively low prevalence of smoking in these [vegetarian] cohorts".[54] 
Over 32,000 species of fish have been described,[2] making them the most diverse group of vertebrates. In addition, there are many species of shellfish. However, only a small number of species are commonly eaten by humans.[citation needed] 
Fish are aquatic, craniate, gill-bearing animals that lack limbs with digits. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Around 99% of living fish species are ray-finned fish, belonging to the class Actinopterygii, with over 95% belonging to the teleost subgrouping. 
The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. 
Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterparts. 
Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods. 
Most fish are ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature.[1][2] Fish can acoustically communicate with each other, most often in the context of feeding, aggression or courtship.[3] 
Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., cusk-eels and snailfish), although no species has yet been documented in the deepest 25% of the ocean.[4] With 34,300 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.[5] 
Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (in aquaculture). They are also caught by recreational fishers, kept as pets, raised by fishkeepers, and exhibited in public aquaria. Fish have had a role in culture through the ages, serving as deities, religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies. 
Karapınar or Macarköy (Hungarian: Feketeforrás or Magyarfalu (Madzsarköj)) is a Hungarian village in Turkey, at the Aegean shore. Karapınar is the new name of the village. 
In June 2015 it was reported that several sinkholes up to 70 feet deep appeared around the town. Most have been on farmland and are of great concern to the local farmers.[1] It was blamed on recent heavy rains dissolving the limestone underground. 
This village was established 420 years ago. The villagers were settled in the village when part of the Kingdom of Hungary was occupied by the Ottoman Empire. 
Teenagers from polygamous families demonstrate at a pro-plural marriage rally in Salt Lake City in 2006. 
Over 200 supporters attended the event.[1] 
Today, the LDS Church continues to excommunicate members who advocate early Mormon doctrines such as plural marriage, enter into or solemnize plural marriages (whether in the United States or elsewhere), or actively support Mormon fundamentalist or dissident groups. Although some LDS Church members continue to believe in the doctrine of plural marriage without practicing it,[11] Joseph Smith's teachings on plural marriage remain part of the scriptural canon of the LDS Church.[12] The LDS Church prevents any of its members who sympathize with Mormon fundamentalist teachings from entering its temples.[13] 
Mormon fundamentalism (also called fundamentalist Mormonism) is a belief in the validity of selected fundamental aspects of Mormonism as taught and practiced in the nineteenth century, particularly during the administrations of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and John Taylor, the first three presidents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Mormon fundamentalists seek to uphold tenets and practices no longer held by mainstream Mormons (members of the LDS Church). The principle most often associated with Mormon fundamentalism is plural marriage, a form of polygyny first taught in the Latter Day Saint movement by the movement's founder, Smith. 
The LDS Church began prohibiting the contracting of plural marriages within the United States in 1890 after a decree by church president Wilford Woodruff. However, the practice continued underground in the U.S. and openly in Mormon colonies in northern Mexico and southern Alberta. According to some sources, many polygamous men in the United States continued to live with their plural wives with the approval of church presidents Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, and Joseph F. Smith.[6][8] 
They make their argument based upon textual evidence and the fact that the "Manifesto" is not worded in accordance with similar revelations in the LDS scriptures. This argument further holds that after joining the Union, Utah would have had the authority to enact its own laws with respect to marriage, rather than being bound by U.S. territorial laws that prohibited polygamy. Before statehood could be granted in 1896, however, the federal government required Utah to include a provision in its state constitution stating that "polygamous or plural marriages are forever prohibited."[9] Fundamentalists (and many scholars of Mormon history) also believe that a primary impetus for the 1890 Manifesto was the Edmunds–Tucker Act of 1887, a stringent federal law that legally dissolved the LDS Church, disenfranchised women (who had been given the vote in Utah in 1870), and required voters to take an anti-polygamy oath before being permitted to vote in an election. 
With the selection of Latter-day Saint Reed Smoot to be one of Utah's representatives to the U.S. Senate in 1903, national attention was again focused on the continuation of plural marriage in Utah, which culminated in the Reed Smoot hearings. In 1904, church president Joseph F. Smith issued a "Second Manifesto", after which time it became LDS Church policy to excommunicate those church members who entered into or solemnized new polygamous marriages.[10] The seriousness with which this new measure was taken is evinced in the fact that apostle John W. Taylor, son of the church's third president, was excommunicated in 1911 for his continued opposition to the Manifesto. 
Moroni (/məˈroʊnaɪ/), according to the Book of Mormon, was the last Nephite prophet, historian, and military commander who lived in the Americas in the late fourth and early fifth centuries. He is later known as the Angel Moroni, who presented the golden plates to Joseph Smith, who translated the plates upon which the Book of Mormon was originally written. 
According to the Book of Mormon, Moroni was the son of Mormon,[1] the prophet for whom the Book of Mormon is named. Moroni shares a name with Captain Moroni, a much earlier Book of Mormon figure, of whom Mormon wrote highly.[2] 
The Book of Mormon tells that Moroni served under his father, the commander in chief of 23 groups of about 10,000 Nephites each,[3] who battled against the Lamanites. Upon the Nephites' defeat at Cumorah, Moroni was forced to go into hiding and to wander from place to place to avoid being killed by the Lamanites. 
Moroni was the last known survivor of the Nephite nation. 
Moroni had been commanded by his father to complete the Nephite record, which Mormon had abridged from previous records. Moroni is the ascribed author of chapters 8 and 9 of Mormon's record within the larger Book of Mormon, the entire Book of Moroni, and the Title Page of the Book of Mormon. He also added the Book of Ether into the plates, which is primarily an abridgment of Jaredite writings, but also contains extensive commentary by Moroni, especially in Ether 4, Ether 5, Ether 8, and Ether 12. 
Moroni was the last prophet to write in the Book of Mormon. 
Moroni then writes that he had spoken to Jesus and received extensive visions of the future. Speaking directly to modern-day readers of the Book of Mormon, Moroni writes, "Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not. But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I know your doing".[4] 
Afterlife 
On February 16, 1832, while working on translation of the New Testament passage John 5:29 in the upstairs bedroom of the John Johnson home, Smith and Rigdon received what was known to early Latter Day Saints as "the Vision." It detailed a heaven divided into three degrees of glory, the Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial Kingdoms, where resurrected beings would go after the final judgement.[1][7] 
Assignment to a particular kingdom in the resurrection is contingent upon the desires and actions exhibited during mortal and post-mortal life. 
Critically different from Disciple of Christ beliefs was that in Latter Day Saint theology, virtually all would be saved, to include sinners, a distinction that caused some to apostatize from the young church.[1] The LDS Church teaches that these different kingdoms are what Jesus was referring to when he said "[i]n my Father's house are many mansions" (John 14:2).[8] Additionally, that 1 Corinthians[9] speaks of these three degrees of glory, comparing them with the glory of the sun, moon, and stars.[10] 
Christian universalism, or the idea that God would save all of humanity, was a prominent and polarizing religious belief in the 1830s. Many converts to the early church disagreed with Universalism and felt the Book of Mormon justified their views. 
When news of "the Vision" reached the branches of the church, it was not well received by all and seen by many as a major shift in theology towards Universalism.[11] An antagonistic newspaper wrote that with "the Vision" Joseph Smith had tried to "disgrace Universalism by professing ... the salvation of all men."[12][13] 
The branch in Geneseo, New York was particularly apprehensive. Ezra Landon, a leader of the Geneseo branch who had convinced a number of others against the Vision, told visiting missionaries that "the vision was of the Devil & he believed it no more than he believed the devil was crucified ... & that he Br Landing would not have the vision taught in the church for $1000." 
Joseph Smith sent a letter to the branch making clear that disbelief in the Vision was an excommunicable offense, and after refusing to change his position Landon was excommunicated.[1][14] 
Brigham Young said, 
It was a great trial to many, and some apostatized because God was not going to send to everlasting punishment heathens and infants, but had a place of salvation, in due time, for all, and would bless the honest and virtuous and truthful, whether they ever belonged to any church or not. It was a new doctrine to this generation, and many stumbled at it. ... 
My traditions were such, that when the Vision came first to me, it was directly contrary and opposed to my former education. I said, Wait a little. 
I did not reject it; but I could not understand it.[15][16] 
Joseph Young, Brigham's brother, said, "I could not believe it at first. Why the Lord was going to save every body."[17][2] 
"The Vision" was not published until five months after it was received, and after the first two years was rarely mentioned in the 1830s or early 1840s.[1] After the tepid reception of "the Vision", Joseph Smith gave instruction to missionaries to "remain silent" about it, until prospective converts had first believed the basic principles.[2][18] 
The celestial kingdom will be the residence of those who have been righteous, accepted the teachings of Jesus Christ, and made and lived up to all of the required ordinances and covenants.[20] Individuals may accept and receive these ordinances and covenants during their mortal lives. For those who did not have the opportunity while living, they will have the opportunity in the post-mortal spirit world, where they can accept ordinances performed on their behalf by LDS Church members in temples.[21] All children who die before the age of eight automatically inherit the celestial kingdom without the reception of ordinances.[22] The celestial kingdom is the permanent residence of God the Father and Jesus Christ.[23][5] 
Joseph Smith taught that "a white stone is given to each of those who come into the celestial kingdom, whereon is a new name written, which no man knoweth save he that receiveth it."[24] This white stone will become a Urim and Thummim (or seer stone) to the recipient.[25] 
Smith taught that only those individuals who are sealed in celestial marriage to a spouse will be permitted to enter into the highest degree of celestial glory.[26] These individuals will eventually become "exalted".[27] It is believed that this cannot be comprehended in the world; rather, it is said that the learning and understanding of salvation and exaltation will occur even beyond the grave.[28] Like other ordinances, the sealing to a spouse may occur during mortal life or may be accepted by the parties in the afterlife and performed by proxy in a temple. 
In the Mormon theology and cosmology there are three degrees of glory (alternatively, kingdoms of glory) which are the ultimate, eternal dwelling place for nearly all who lived on earth after they are resurrected from the spirit world. 
Smith also taught that the earth will also receive a celestial glory.[29] Smith taught the earth, like the planet where God resides, will be "made like unto crystal and will be a Urim and Thummim to the inhabitants who dwell thereon".[30][3][31] 
The terrestrial kingdom is the middle of the three degrees of glory. It is believed by LDS Church members to correspond to the "bodies terrestrial" and "glory of the moon" mentioned by the apostle Paul in the King James Version translation of 1 Corinthians 15:40–41 The word "terrestrial" derives from a Latin word meaning "earthly".[32][2] 
According to Doctrine and Covenants Section 76, those who will inhabit the terrestrial kingdom include those who lived respectably but "were blinded by the craftiness of men" and thus rejected the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ when it was presented to them.[33] It also includes persons who rejected the "testimony of Jesus in the flesh, but afterwards received it" in the spirit world[34] and those who "are not valiant in the testimony of Jesus" after having received it.[35][4] 
Ultimately, the kingdom of glory (either the celestial or the terrestrial) received by those who accept the testimony of Jesus will be based on God's knowledge of whether they "would have received it with all their hearts" as manifested by their works and the "desire of their hearts".[36][2] 
Those who inherit the terrestrial kingdom "receive of the presence of the Son, but not the fulness of the Father."[37][2] 
Joseph Smith elaborated on Paul's descriptions based primarily upon a vision he received with Sidney Rigdon in 1832 and recorded in Doctrine and Covenants (D&C) Section 76. According to this vision, all people will be resurrected and, at the Final Judgment, will be assigned to one of three degrees of glory, called the celestial, terrestrial, and telestial kingdoms. A small number of individuals who commit the unpardonable sin will not receive a kingdom of glory, but will be banished to outer darkness with Satan where they will be "sons of Perdition". 
The telestial kingdom is the lowest of the three degrees of glory. 
It is believed by LDS Church members to correspond to the "glory of the stars" mentioned by the apostle Paul in the King James Version translation of 1 Corinthians 15:41.[1] “Telestial" is a term with no prior usage, and it was not made clear if the word was meant to be part of the vision or an invention by Smith or Rigdon.[2] Historian Mark Staker points out that Rigdon had elementary experience with Latin and Greek, and that the word reflects the idea of being far off or reaching the end.[3] 
According to the book of Doctrine and Covenants, those who will inhabit the telestial kingdom include those "who received not the gospel of Christ, nor the testimony of Jesus."[39] It will also include "liars, and sorcerers, and adulterers, and whoremongers, and whosoever loves and makes a lie", as well as "murderers, and idolaters".[40] Because of their refusal to accept Jesus as their Savior, these individuals will remain in spirit prison for 1,000 years during the millennial reign of Christ.[41] After the 1000 years, the individuals will be resurrected and receive an immortal physical body and be assigned to the telestial kingdom.[42][19] 
Smith taught that individuals in the telestial kingdom will be servants of God, but "where God and Christ dwell they cannot come, worlds without end";[43] however, they will receive the ministration of the Holy Ghost and beings from the terrestrial kingdom.[44] Despite these limitations, in LDS Church theology being resident in the telestial kingdom is not an unpleasant experience: "the glory of the telestial ... surpasses all understanding".[45][4] 
Smith also taught that just as there are different degrees of glory within the celestial kingdom (D&C 131:1–4), there are different degrees of glory within the telestial kingdom. He stated that "as one star differs from another star in glory, even so differs one from another in the telestial world."[46] In the telestial kingdom, each person's glory will vary depending on their works while on the earth.[47] 
Smith and Rigdon stated, "we saw the glory and the inhabitants of the telestial world, that they were as innumerable as the stars in the firmament of heaven, or as the sand upon the seashore".[48] Bruce R. McConkie suggested that by implication this means that "most of the adult people who have lived from the day of Adam to the present time will go to the telestial kingdom."[49] 
During the original endowment temple ordinance, church members moved between ordinance rooms that represented the three different kingdoms of glory. In most newer LDS temples, the majority of the moves between rooms have been replaced with changes in lighting to represent changes from one degree of glory to the next. 
In some of the church's older temples (e.g., the Salt Lake, Idaho Falls Idaho, Manti Utah, and Cardston Alberta temples), the classic version of the endowment ceremony is still done by moving from room to room. 
Every LDS temple includes a celestial room—representing the celestial kingdom—that is separate from the other ordinance rooms. 
Some, including Mormon historian D. Michael Quinn, have argued that various parts of the plan of salvation were influenced in part by Emanuel Swedenborg's book Heaven and Hell.[1] In Heaven and Hell, Swedenborg wrote that "[t]here are three heavens" that are "entirely distinct from each other."[51] Swedenborg called the highest heaven "the Celestial Kingdom." He also stated that the inhabitants of the three heavens corresponded to the "sun, moon and stars."[51] 
Swedenborgian writings were spread widely in New England in the early 1800s by Swedenborgian missionaries.[52] In 1839 Smith met with a recent Latter Day Saint convert from Swedenborgianims, Edward Hunter, and told him, "Emanuel Swedenborg had a view of the world to come, but for daily food he perished."[50] Others, including Smith's biographer Richard Bushman have argued it is more likely that Smith and Swedenborg developed their ideas independently based on 1 Corinthians chapter 15.[53][54] 
In April 1830, the Church of Christ was organized in upstate New York. 
By October of that year, the church had grown to between seventy and eighty disciples.[1] That fall missionaries were sent west to convert the Native Americans in Missouri. 
They passed through Kirtland, Ohio, where they encountered widespread success among the congregations of Sidney Rigdon, adding hundreds of additional converts.[2] Many of these members, including Rigdon, had formerly been members of the Disciples of Christ led by Alexander Campbell. 
In 1831 Smith and the Latter Day Saints in upstate New York migrated to what had become the center of Church membership in Kirtland.[1] Smith and Rigdon studied and prayed intensively together, and after comparing the Book of Mormon, the Bible and Smith's earlier revelations, they concluded that "God rewarded everyone according to the deeds done in the body" and "the term 'Heaven,' as intended for the Saints' eternal home must include more kingdoms than one."[2][6] 
Brigham Young (/ˈbrɪɡəm/; June 1, 1801 – August 29, 1877)[3] was an American religious leader and politician. He was the second president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1847 until his death in 1877. 
He founded Salt Lake City and served as the first governor of the Utah Territory. Young also led the foundings of the precursors to the University of Utah and Brigham Young University. 
Young had many nicknames, among the most popular being "American Moses"[4] (alternatively, "Modern Moses" or "Mormon Moses"),[5][6] because, like the biblical figure, Young led his followers, the Mormon pioneers, in an exodus through a desert, to what they saw as a promised land.[7] Young was dubbed by his followers the "Lion of the Lord" for his bold personality and commonly was called "Brother Brigham" by Latter-day Saints. 
A polygamist, Young had 55 wives and 56 children. He instituted a ban prohibiting conferring the priesthood on men of black African descent, and led the church in the Utah War against the United States.[8] 
Before his death in Salt Lake City on August 29, 1877,[62] Young was suffering from cholera morbus and inflammation of the bowels.[63] It is believed that he died of peritonitis from a ruptured appendix.[2] His last words were "Joseph! 
Joseph! 
Joseph!", invoking the name of the late Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon faith.[64] On September 2, 1877, Young's funeral was held in the Tabernacle with an estimated 12,000 to 15,000 people in attendance.[65] He is buried on the grounds of the Mormon Pioneer Memorial Monument in the heart of Salt Lake City. 
A bronze marker was placed at the grave site June 10, 1938, by members of the Young Men and Young Women organizations, which he founded.[66] 
Young engaged in a vast assortment of commercial ventures by himself and in partnership with others. These included a wagon express company, a ferryboat company, a railroad and the manufacturing of processed lumber, wool, sugar beets, iron, and liquor. 
Young achieved greatest success in real estate. He also tried to promote Mormon self-sufficiency by establishing collectivist communities, known as the United Order of Enoch.[67]

A century after his death, one writer stated that[68] 
Young had a somewhat mixed view of slavery.[70] In January 1852, he declared in a speech that "no property can or should be recognized as existing in slaves."[71][72] This suggests Young was antagonistic towards the existence of slavery. However, two weeks later he declared himself a "firm believer in slavery."[73][74][75] There is also evidence to suggest Young believed in the racial superiority of white men. 
His manuscript history from January 5, 1852, which was published in the Deseret News, reads: 
The negro . . . should serve the seed of Abraham; he should not be a ruler, nor vote for men to rule over me nor my brethren. The Constitution of Deseret is silent upon this, we meant it should be so. The seed of Canaan cannot hold any office, civil or ecclesiastical. . . . 
The decree of God that Canaan should be a servant of servants unto his brethren (i.e., Shem and Japhet [sic]) is in full force. The day will come when the seed of Canaan will be redeemed and have all the blessings their brethren enjoy. Any person that mingles his seed with the seed of Canaan forfeits the right to rule and all the blessings of the Priesthood of God; and unless his blood were spilled and that of his offspring he nor they could not be saved until the posterity of Canaan are redeemed.[76] 
Young was born the eighth child of John Young and Abigail "Nabby" Howe[9][page needed], a farming family in Whitingham, Vermont. When he was three his family moved to upstate New York settling in Smyrna, New York.[10][page needed] At age 12 he moved with his parents to Aurelius, New York close to Cayuga Lake. 
When he was 14 his mother died of tuberculosis. 
After that he moved with his father to Tyrone, New York. 
As a Seventy, Young served several more missions for the church,[1] including one to New York and Massachusetts with Burr Riggs in 1835 and one to his relatives in the eastern United States with his brother Brigham in 1836.[citation needed] 
Young received his endowment in Nauvoo on February 3, 1844, just months before Joseph Smith was killed.[1] He was selected by Smith as an inaugural member of the Council of Fifty on March 1, 1845.[2] At the time Smith was killed, Young was campaigning on behalf of Smith's bid for the presidency of the United States.[1] 
Like many early Latter Day Saints, Young practiced plural marriage.[1] On January 16, 1846, he was married to Lucinda Allen and Lydia Caroline Hagar, in the Nauvoo Temple. 
Soon to follow was Mary Ann Huntley on February 6, 1846. Later, on 7 April 1868 he married Sarah Jane Snow, and Elizabeth Stevens on November 28, 1868.[4] Young would eventually father a total of twenty-one children.[1] 
Young and his four wives left Illinois in 1846 and settled in Winter Quarters, Nebraska, and later Carterville, Iowa. He and his wives left Carterville in 1850 to join the Latter Day Saints who had followed his brother Brigham to the Salt Lake Valley in Utah Territory. 
Young arrived in Salt Lake City in September 1850.[1] The Youngs travelled in the William Snow/Joseph Young Company, with Young acting as a captain of the group.[2] 
In 1870, Young served a final mission for the church to the British Isles. 
He also served in the Utah Territorial legislature.[1] He died in Salt Lake City on July 16, 1881 at the age of 84.[2] At the time of his death, Young had served as a general authority or a missionary of the church for nearly fifty years. 
Joseph Young (April 7, 1797 – July 16, 1881)[1] was an early convert to the Latter Day Saint movement and was a missionary and longtime general authority of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was an elder brother of Brigham Young. 
Young was born in Hopkinton, Massachusetts on April 7, 1797,[1] the eighth child[citation needed] born to John Young and Abigail Howe.[1] 
In the fall of 1832, Young joined the gathering of Latter Day Saints in Kirtland, Ohio,[1] where he met Joseph Smith, the founder of the church. Shortly after arriving in Kirtland,[citation needed] Smith asked Young to depart on another mission for the church to Upper Canada, which he served over the winter months of 1832 and 1833 with his brother Brigham.[2] 
On February 18, 1834, Young married Jane Adeline Bicknell in Geneseo, New York.[1] The couple would eventually have eleven children,[2] including daughters Jane Adeline, Julia Ann Vilate, and Chloe Eliza, as well as sons Joseph Bicknell, Seymour Bicknell, and Marcus LeGrand.[3]

Release 
The film's trailer was released on YouTube on 25 July 2012, and currently has about ten million views, making it one of the most watched Nollywood trailers.[6][7] It was released in Ghana on 22 September 2012,[8][9] and premiered at the Silverbird Cinema, Victoria Island, Lagos on 28 September 2012.[2] 
The film has a 24% rating on Nollywood Reinvented, which criticized the story direction, and the actors' performances. It concluded by stating, "Cinematography was nearly nonexistent! 
Pascal Amanfo did not do a shabby job - It wasn’t that bad; [However], with a movie like this and a title like Single and Married, I think it’d be a bit far-fetched to watch this movie looking for an amazing storyline. If you go in seeking a magnanimous storyline or to be thrilled, sorry but you will be disappointed. 
So go in to watch people drive fancy cars, live in pretty houses and wear colourful clothes".[10] The Ghanaian Chronicle gave a positive review, commenting: "The storyline raised serious issues about why spouses cheat on their partners and how to stop them. But it was told in a rather subtle, entertaining way. It is indeed a must-see movie".[11] 
Single and Married had ten nominations at the 2012 Ghana Movie Awards, including Best Actress in a Lead Role (English) for Nelson, Best Actor in a Supporting Role (English) for Attoh, Best Picture – African Collaboration, Best Editing, Best Art Direction and Best Music (Original Song). It eventually won Best Picture, Best Directing (English Language), Best Actress in a Support Role (English), and Best Cinematography.

A sequel, Single, Married and Complicated, was released in 2014.[4][5] 
Jay (Chris Attoh), a casanova, to the surprise of his friends, proposes to his girlfriend, Kimora (Yvonne Nelson). Jay's friend, Raymond (Kweku Elliot) a casanova who's now also married to one of Kimora's friends, Paula (Nadia Buari), is indifferent. Andy (Eddie Watson), the "baddest" of the trio, thinks Jay is about to get into a lifetime imprisonment. 
Jay eventually breaks up with her, because she's become too possessive of him; on his way out of her apartment, Jay bumps into Raymond, who's also coming out of a mistress' apartment, thereby discovering each other's secrets. Apparently, Paula, a lawyer, is always busy with work and never finds time for Raymond, while Kimora has also refused to give Jay a blowjob. Paula introduces Raymond to Yolanda (Itz Tiffany), her old friend, and Raymond starts an affair with her as well. 
Vida (Tana Adelana), a friend of Kimora and Paula, is married to Ranesh (Kofi Adjorlolo), a 59-year-old man who leaves her very unsatisfied in bed. She meets her new neighbor Andy, and eventually confesses that she wants to have sex with him, leading to them having an affair. 
Jay speaks out of tune during an argument with Kimora, leading to him confessing his affairs, including the one with Judith. Paula realizes that she's had a very bad sex life with her husband, so she makes a sex timetable; infuriates Raymond and he asks for a divorce. During the divorce deliberation, Paula reveals that she knows about Raymond's affair with Yolanda, and that it was in fact a bet between her and Yolanda. 
Vaginal Davis is often associated with the formation of the Queercore zine movement.[11] From 1982 to 1991, she self-published the zine Fertile La Toyah Jackson,[12] focused on the imaginary adventures of a skateboarding, pregnant Jackson, and hailed by The Advocate critic Adam Block as "A veritable John Waters film of a skinny 'zine."[3] Bruce LaBruce described the zine as "an underground rag that featured SoCal punk scene gossip, photos of hot Huntington Beach surfers and wistful musings by Miss Davis themself."[14] Through Davis' job at UCLA's Placement & Career Planning Center, she was allowed free access to a Xerox machine to publish the zine.[15] Davis went on to develop the zine into a series of videos titled Fertile LaToyah Jackson Video Magazine, Volume 1 and 2.[16] 
Davis was well known for her [1] band ¡Cholita! 
The Female Menudo, where she assumed the persona of a 13-and-a-half year old Latina[2] named Graciela. Band mates included longtime collaborator Alice Bag as Sad Girl and Fertile LaToyah Jackson as Guadalupe, ages 16 and 12-and-a half respectively.[16] 
In 1989, Davis formed the speed metal thrash band Pedro, Muriel, and Esther (PME) with Glen Meadmore.[1] In PME, Davis performs as Clarence, "a white-supremacist militia-man from Idaho complete with ZZ Top beard."[2] Davis had previously sung backup vocals for Meadmore, with RuPaul. 
PME disbanded after releasing a four-song EP on Amoeba records.[18][19] 
In 1995, Pedro, Muriel, and Esther reunited for a performance at the Queercore '95 festival in Chicago.[1] The band later released their first full-length album The White to Be Angry, produced by Steve Albini in 1998 on Spectra Sonic Records.[2] 
In Los Angeles, Davis has hosted and DJ'd a range of performance and music events, one of the most prominent being "Bricktops" (2002–2005), a weekly salon/speak-easy inspired by vaudevillian Ada "Bricktop" Smith.[1] they also hosted and DJed a Sunday afternoon music event called "Sucker" (1994–2000). 
Davis and artist Ron Athey curated and hosted GIMP (2000–2001), a monthly night of performance art. 
Vaginal Davis is an American performing artist, painter, independent curator, composer, filmmaker and writer.[1] Born intersex and raised in South Central, Los Angeles, Davis gained notoriety in New York during the 1980s,[2] where she inspired the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn's prevalent drag scene as a genderqueer artist.[3][4] She currently resides in Berlin, Germany.[5] 
Growing up, Davis lived with her mother, originally from Louisiana, and four older sisters. Her mother was Black Creole, her father was of Mexican and Jewish descent,[6] and her grandfather was of German descent, with Davis stating that he was born in Wannsee and the "black sheep" of the von Hohenzollern dynasty.[2] Davis' mother was a revolutionary feminist and community activist in the South Central area, and planted food gardens in vacant lots to help feed the homeless, impoverished, and marginalized peoples of the area. 
As a young child in the Los Angeles public education system, Davis was accepted into a program for gifted students, where she was first exposed to and developed a love of theater and opera.[2][3] At age 7, Davis saw Mozart's The Magic Flute on a school trip to the opera, and credits this experience as a catalyst for her development as a drag queen.[7] 
Davis' name pays homage to activist Angela Davis, and considers Davis' involvement with the Black Panther Party and activism as a whole to be one of her biggest inspirations, explaining, "They came into the schools, they had guns, and they took over. They were teaching us all these revolutionary songs and chants and what not. 
At that time, when Angela Davis was the most wanted woman in America, I was just fixated with that image of her. By the late '70s I had decided I sort of wanted to sexualize her name and become her, more or less. So I started in the late '70s calling myself Vaginal Davis. 
I started to perform– or tried to perform– at these gay clubs in Los Angeles, in Hollywood. 
The people in these clubs, they would look at me and say, 'Vaginal Davis? Well who are you supposed to be?' 
And I said, 'Well, Angela Davis– it's a homage to that.' 
And they'd say, 'Well who's that?' They didn't know who Angela Davis was."[1] 
Vaginal Davis is one of the founders of the homo-core punk movement. She chooses to exploit herself to engage in rude provocations and "gender-fucking." As a self-labeled "sexual repulsive", she is an icon of the disruptive performance aesthetic known as terrorist drag.[4] 
Vaginal Davis' band the Afro Sisters released their first seven-inch EP Indigo, Sassafras & Molasses, produced by Geza X with Amoeba Records in 1978.[8][9] The Afro Sisters opened for the Smiths on their first American tour, as well as the Happy Mondays.[10] 
Sex Education is a British teen comedy-drama streaming television series created by Laurie Nunn for Netflix. The series follows the lives of the students, staff and parents of the fictitious Moordale Secondary School as they contend with various personal dilemmas, often related to sexual intimacy. 
It features an ensemble cast that includes Asa Butterfield, Gillian Anderson, Ncuti Gatwa, Emma Mackey, Connor Swindells, Kedar Williams-Stirling, Alistair Petrie, Mimi Keene, and Aimee Lou Wood. 
The first series was released on 11 January 2019, the second on 17 January 2020, and the third on 17 September 2021. The series has been renewed for a fourth series.[1] 
Sex Education has received critical acclaim, with particular praise for its ensemble cast, writing, directing, production values, and mature treatment of its themes. The series has been a viewership success, with over 40 million viewers streaming the first series after its debut. Wood won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Female Comedy Performance for her role in the second series. 
In the first series, Otis sets up a sex therapy clinic with Maeve to help the students of Moordale with their sexual problems.[2][3] Their business becomes a success but conflict arises when Otis finds himself becoming attracted to Maeve. 
In the second series, Otis is hit with the pressures of a high school romance after Ola becomes his girlfriend. New students arrive and challenge the status quo at Moordale while a chlamydia outbreak causes the teens to question and struggle with topical issues.[4] 
The removal of the penis was used as a punishment for men in the Heian period in Japan, where it replaced execution. It was called rasetsu 羅切 (らせつ), and was separate from castration which was called kyūkei 宮刑 (きゅうけい).[11][12] Rasetsu was done voluntarily by some Japanese Buddhist priests to ensure celibacy.[13][14] Rasetsu was also known in Edo period Japan.[15] 
The word rasetsu was made out of the components "ra" from "mara" which meant penis, and "setsu", which meant cutting.[16][17] 
The word rasetsu was used in Japanese literature.[18] 
Kyūkei in Japanese law referred to the punishment of castration, which was used for male offenders, and confinement for females.[19][20][21][22][23][24] 
The Arab slave trade provided many eunuchs who were more highly prized, and priced. African boys were generally subject to penis removal, as well as castration.[25] 
A study of penis reattachment in China found that in a group of 50 men, all but one reacquired functionality, even though some involved full reconstructive surgery using tissue and bone. Reportedly some of these men later fathered children.[26] 
If reattachment is not an option (such as the penis not being reattached long after 24 hours),[27][5] doctors can reconstruct a penis from muscle and skin grafted from another part of the body like the forearm. 
However, a penile implant is needed for an erection to be possible, as the reconstructed penis would look strange and would either not be able to ejaculate,[28][29] or ejaculate with less force.[27] Patients are often dissatisfied with the reconstructed penis.[30] Since 2015, Zephyr Surgical Implants produces malleable and inflatable penile implants particularly designed for phalloplasty surgeries.[31] Standing during urination is an advantage offered by a reconstructed penis.[32] If penis reconstruction is not done, the patient will have to squat in order to urinate since doctors reroute the entrance of the urethra to below the scrotum.[28] 
In ancient civilizations, the removal of the human penis was sometimes used to demonstrate superiority or dominance over an enemy. Armies were sometimes known to sever the penises of their enemies to count the dead, as well as for trophies. The practice of castration (removal of the testicles) sometimes involved the removal of all or part of the penis, generally with a tube inserted to keep the urethra open for urination. 
In Russia, men of a devout group of Spiritual Christians known as the Skoptsy were castrated, either undergoing "greater castration", which entailed removal of the penis, or "lesser castration", in which the penis remained in place, while Skoptsy women underwent mastectomy. These procedures were performed in an effort to eliminate lust and to restore the Christian to a pristine state that existed prior to original sin. 
In the modern era, removing the human penis for any such activity is very rare (with some exceptions listed below), and references to removal of the penis are almost always symbolic. Castration is less rare, and is performed as a last resort in the treatment of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer.[1][2][3] 
Some men have penile amputations, known as penectomies, for medical reasons. Cancer, for example, sometimes necessitates removal of all or part of the penis. In some instances, botched childhood circumcisions have also resulted in full or partial penectomies.[4] A man who has his penis removed may have one or more problems with his personality, urination, sex life, and vulnerable testicles; he may also experience a phantom penis (see phantom limb).[2][better source needed] 
The number of sperm in an ejaculation also varies widely, depending on many factors, including the time since the last ejaculation,[13] age, stress levels,[14] and testosterone. Greater lengths of sexual stimulation immediately preceding ejaculation can result in higher concentrations of sperm.[3] An unusually low sperm count, not the same as low semen volume, is known as oligospermia, and the absence of any sperm from the semen is termed azoospermia. 
The first ejaculation in males often occurs about 12 months after the onset of puberty, generally through masturbation or nocturnal emission (wet dreams). This first semen volume is small. The typical ejaculation over the following three months produces less than 1 ml of semen. 
The semen produced during early puberty is also typically clear. After ejaculation this early semen remains jellylike and, unlike semen from mature males, fails to liquefy. A summary of semen development is shown in Table 1. 
Most first ejaculations (90 percent) lack sperm. Of the few early ejaculations that do contain sperm, the majority of sperm (97%) lack motion. 
The remaining sperm (3%) have abnormal motion.[15] 
Ejaculation is the discharge of semen (the ejaculate; normally containing sperm) from the male reproductory tract as a result of an orgasm. It is the final stage and natural objective of male sexual stimulation, and an essential component of natural conception. In rare cases, ejaculation occurs because of prostatic disease. 
Anejaculation is the condition of being unable to ejaculate. Ejaculation is usually very pleasurable for men; dysejaculation is an ejaculation that is painful or uncomfortable. Retrograde ejaculation is the condition where semen travels backwards into the bladder rather than out the urethra. 
As the male proceeds through puberty, the semen develops mature characteristics with increasing quantities of normal sperm. Semen produced 12 to 14 months after the first ejaculation liquefies after a short period of time. Within 24 months of the first ejaculation, the semen volume and the quantity and characteristics of the sperm match that of adult male semen.[1] 
To map the neuronal activation of the brain during the ejaculatory response, researchers have studied the expression of c-Fos, a proto-oncogene expressed in neurons in response to stimulation by hormones and neurotransmitters.[17] Expression of c-Fos in the following areas has been observed:[18][19] 
Although uncommon, some men can achieve ejaculations during masturbation without any manual stimulation. Such men usually do it by tensing and flexing their abdominal and buttocks muscles along with vigorous fantasising. Others may do it by relaxing the area around the penis, which may result in harder erections especially when hyperaroused.[20] 
Perineum pressing results in an ejaculation which is purposefully held back by pressing on either the perineum or the urethra to force the seminal fluid to remain inside. In such a scenario, the seminal fluid stays inside the body and goes to the bladder. 
Some people do this to avoid making a mess by keeping all the semen inside.[21] As a medical condition, it is called retrograde ejaculation.[22] 
In mammals and birds, multiple ejaculation is commonplace.[37][38][clarification needed] During copulation, the two sides of a short-beaked echidna's penis are used sequentially. Alternating between the two sides allows for persistent stimulation to induce ejaculation without impeding the refractory period.[39] 
In stallions, ejaculation is accompanied by a motion of the tail known as "tail flagging".[40] When a male wolf ejaculates, his final pelvic thrust may be slightly prolonged.[41] A male rhesus monkey usually ejaculates less than 15 seconds after sexual penetration.[42] The first report and footage of spontaneous ejaculation in an aquatic mammal was recorded in a wild Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin near Mikura Island, Japan, in 2012.[43] 
In horses, sheep, and cattle, ejaculation occurs within a few seconds, but in boars, it can last for five to thirty[44] minutes.[45] Ejaculation in boars is stimulated when the spiral-shaped penis interlocks with the female's cervix.[46] A mature boar can produce 250–300 ml (8.8–10.6 imp fl oz; 8.5–10.1 US fl oz) of semen during one ejaculation.[45] In llamas and alpacas, ejaculation occurs continuously during copulation.[47] 
The semen of male dogs is ejaculated in three separate phases.[48] The last phase of a male canine’s ejaculation occurs during the copulatory tie, and contains mostly prostatic fluid.[49] 
Premature ejaculation is when ejaculation occurs before the desired time. If a man is unable to ejaculate in a timely manner after prolonged sexual stimulation, in spite of his desire to do so, it is called delayed ejaculation or anorgasmia. An orgasm that is not accompanied by ejaculation is known as a dry orgasm.

Victims of failed circumcisions have reported contemplating suicide due to depression and feeling deprived of their manhood.[10] In December 2014, the world's first successful penis transplant was performed by a team led by Dr Andre van der Merwe. 
The patient was a 21-year-old man who fell victim of complications due to initiation rituals at illegitimate initiation schools.[10][11] On 21 April 2017 a second penis transplant was performed by the same team of doctors led by Dr Andre van der Merwe on a 40-year-old man who lost his penis 17 years prior to the procedure.[12] Doctors have said that due to the circumstances surrounding illegal circumcision schools, South Africa has become one of the countries with the greatest need for penis transplantation.[13] 
Homosexual men in South Africa are still vilified and criticized by their communities. 
The ritual practise of ‘Ulwaluko’ is a highly respected and sacred cultural practice among the Xhosa and some Nguni speaking peoples of South Africa. It has been alleged that the impact of the practice may threaten the self-esteem of a homosexual young man, although it is not compulsory for any person to go to the 'bush'. Some homosexual men who partook in this ritual reported doing so in order to receive personal validation of cultural manhood, the same can be said of heterosexual uncircumcised men. 
Other reasons for partaking in Ulwaluko include fulfilling the desire to meet societal expectations as well as pressure from family to ‘convert’ to heterosexuality through the process of Ulwaluko.[14] The Film ‘The Wound’ premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival and is inspired by Thando Mgqolozana novel ‘A man who is not a man’[15] which focuses on the experiences of homosexual men during ‘Ulwaluko’.[16][17] Xhosa traditional leaders criticized the film as being ‘disrespectful’, ‘undermining Xhosa culture’ as it showcased hidden traditions. 
It in fact reveals nothing of the Xhosa people.[18] The film has been compared to the Oscar winning Moonlight.[19] The practice of 'ulwaluko' is furthermore governed by several pieces of legislation to promote the safety and protection of underage initiates who have fallen victim to unhygienic practices at illegal initiation schools, these laws include the South African Constitution (1996), the Children's Act (2005), the (Eastern Cape) Application of Health Standards in Traditional Circumcision Act (2001), and the Traditional Health Practitioners’ Act (2004). 
Details of the ritual are not supposed to be disclosed to females or non-initiated males; according to the principle of 'what happens in the bush, stays in the bush', according to some sources.[21] Cultural prejudice may be so great that uncircumcised or 'improperly' circumcised men are attacked and beaten for their lack of conformity, it is not clear conformity to what or the link to the short term practice itself.[2] In March 2014 a young man was assaulted after he had spoken out during a community meeting about the complications he sustained through the ritual.[22] 
Ulwaluko, traditional circumcision and initiation form childhood to adulthood, is an ancient initiation rite practised (though not exclusively) by the amaXhosa, and is commonly practised throughout South Africa. The ritual is traditionally intended as a teaching institution, to prepare young males for the responsibilities of manhood.[1] Therefore, initiates are called abakhwetha in isiXhosa: aba means a group, and kwetha means to learn. 
A single male in the group is known as an umkhwetha.[2] A male who has not undergone initiation is referred to as inkwenkwe (boy), regardless of his age, and is not allowed to take part in male activities such as tribal meetings.[3]

Practice 
The initiation ritual is commonly conducted during late June/early July or late November/ early December.[4] During the ritual process the traditional surgeon (ingcibi) surgically removes the foreskin. 
After the cut is made, the period of seclusion that follows lasts about one month and is divided into two phases - but this is rarely the case in modern times and/or in urban areas, where it usually lasts at least 4 weeks. During the first 7 days the initiates are confined to a hut (bhoma) and the use of certain foods, for example meat, is restricted, but this may differ as certain homes have their own beliefs or ways of doing things. Water may also be restricted.[5] This phase culminates in the ukojiswa rite, during which food taboos are released, marking the transition to the second phase that lasts a further two to three weeks. 
During these phases the initiates are looked after by the ikhankatha (traditional attendant). The termination of the period of seclusion commences when the boys are urged to race down to the river to wash themselves, yet again, depending on the location. The hut (Bhoma) and the initiates' possessions are burnt, including their clothing. 
This symbolizes a new outward appearance the initiates must take on. It is even customary for the initiated to dress very formally for a set period of time after the rite. Each initiate receives a new blanket and is now called "ikrwala" (singular) which means new man or amakrwala. (plural) (new men).[6] Non initiated men are called Inkwekwe. 
At least 969 initiates have died from complications resulting from the ritual since 1995. 
Accurate statistics are not available for the number of penile amputations, but it is estimated that their number is roughly twice the number of deaths.[7] Most deaths and complications are the result of incompetence on the part of traditional practitioners.[2] This is the reason why in particular Pondoland is heavily affected by deaths and complications. 
The amaMpondo practised the ritual until King Faku prohibited it in the 1820s after he had lost several of his sons from complications. Initiation schools re-emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, and the ritual is now being practised on a large scale.[8] 
In January 2014, Desmond Tutu urged traditional leadership and government to intervene, and "to draw on the skills of qualified medical practitioners to enhance our traditional circumcision practices." He furthermore emphasised the cultural importance of the ritual as educational institution, preparing initiates "to contribute to building a better society for all."[9] 
Over the summer in 2019 in South Africa, a total of 21 boys died in separate initiation schools throughout the region. 
The majority of the deaths were attributed to dehydration due to the restriction of water. The Health Minister Zweli Mkhize recommended that the schools no longer practice the ritual in summer months.[1] 
A willy warmer (or cock sock) is a novelty garment designed to fit over the penis.[1] 
According to the Croatian knitter Radmila Kus, knitted protectors were traditionally worn by Croatian men, particularly in the Mrkopalj mountain region, as a guard against frostbite.[2] Such garments were also worn in Norway, where they were called forhyse, vænakot, or suspensorium.[3] Several examples are preserved in the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History.[3] Sometimes in Norway they would be made from squirrel fur with the fur side inside, to be worn under leather trousers in the winter.[4][5] On the Faroe Islands such garments are called kallvøttur (man mitten) or purrivøttur (testicles mitten).[5] There was a tradition in Norway and Denmark, particularly on the Faroe Islands, where a girl would present her boyfriend with a forhyse to see how seriously he took their relationship. 
If the gift was rejected, this was seen as evidence that he was not yet ready for marriage.[4] 
Since the 20th century, willy warmers are usually made as novelties and joke gifts rather than to serve a functional purpose.[6] In 1939, while filming Gone with the Wind, Clark Gable received a present of a hand-knitted genitalia warmer from Carole Lombard.[7] In the 1950s Joan Crawford knitted a "cock sock" as a parting present for Porfirio Rubirosa.[8] 
The small penis rule is an informal strategy used by authors to evade libel lawsuits. It was described in a New York Times article by Dinitia Smith in 1998: 
The small penis rule was referenced in a 2006 dispute between Michael Crowley and Michael Crichton. Crowley alleged that after he wrote an unflattering review of Crichton's novel State of Fear, Crichton included a character named "Mick Crowley" in the novel Next. The character is a child rapist, described as being a Washington, D.C.-based journalist and Yale graduate with a small penis.[2] 
Gay pornography is the representation of sexual activity between males. Its primary goal is sexual arousal in its audience. Softcore gay pornography also exists; it at one time constituted the genre, and may be produced as beefcake pornography for heterosexual female and homosexual male consumption.[1] 
Homoerotic art and artifacts have a long history, reaching back to Greek antiquity. Every medium has been used to represent sexual acts between men. However, gay pornography in contemporary mass media is mostly concentrated in the making of home videos (including DVDs), cable broadcast and emerging video on demand and wireless markets, as well as images and movies for viewing on the Internet. 
(For printed gay erotica, see gay pulp fiction). 
The Swimming Hole (1884–85) by the American artist Thomas Eakins (1844–1916) is regarded as a masterpiece of American painting,[2][3] and has been called "the most finely designed of all his outdoor pictures".[4] The painting has been "widely cited as a prime example of homoeroticism in American art".[5] Eakins himself appears in the water at bottom right – "in signature position, so to speak."[6] According to Jonathan Weinberg, The Swimming Hole marked the beginning of homoerotic imagery in American art.[7] 
Homoeroticism has been present in photography and film since their invention. 
During much of that time, any sexual depiction had to remain underground because of obscenity laws. In particular, gay material might constitute evidence of an illegal act under sodomy laws in many jurisdictions. This is no longer the case in the United States, since such laws were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2003 in Lawrence v. Texas.

Aerobic exercise is any physical activity that uses large muscle groups and causes the body to use more oxygen than it would while resting.[1] The goal of aerobic exercise is to increase cardiovascular endurance.[7] Examples of aerobic exercise include running, cycling, swimming, brisk walking, skipping rope, rowing, hiking, dancing, playing tennis, continuous training, and long distance running.[6] Anaerobic exercise, which includes strength and resistance training, can firm, strengthen, and increase muscle mass, as well as improve bone density, balance, and coordination.[6] Examples of strength exercises are push-ups, pull-ups, lunges, squats, bench press. 
Anaerobic exercise also includes weight training, functional training, eccentric training, interval training, sprinting, and high-intensity interval training which increase short-term muscle strength.[6][8] Flexibility exercises stretch and lengthen muscles.[6] Activities such as stretching help to improve joint flexibility and keep muscles limber.[6] The goal is to improve the range of motion which can reduce the chance of injury.[6][9] 
Physical exercise can also include training that focuses on accuracy, agility, power, and speed.[10] 
Types of exercise can also be classified as dynamic or static. 'Dynamic' exercises, such as steady running, tend to produce a lowering of the diastolic blood pressure during exercise due to the improved blood flow. Conversely, static exercise (such as weight-lifting) can cause the systolic pressure to rise significantly, albeit transiently, during the performance of the exercise.[11] 
It is performed for various reasons: to aid growth and improve strength, prevent aging, develop muscles and the cardiovascular system, hone athletic skills, weight loss or maintenance, improve health,[2] or simply for enjoyment. Many individuals choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and improve well-being as well as mental health.[3][4] 
In terms of health benefits, the amount of recommended exercise depends upon the goal, the type of exercise, and the age of the person. Even doing a small amount of exercise is healthier than doing none.[5]

Celestial marriage (also called the New and Everlasting Covenant of Marriage, Eternal Marriage, Temple Marriage or The Principle) is a doctrine that marriage can last forever in heaven. This is a unique teaching of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) or Mormonism, and branches of Mormon fundamentalism.[1] 
Celestial marriage is an instance of the LDS Church doctrine of sealing. Following a celestial marriage, not only are the couple sealed as husband and wife, but children born into the marriage are also sealed to that family. In cases where the husband and wife have been previously married civilly and there are already children from their union, the children accompany their parents to the temple and are sealed to their parents following the marriage ceremony. 
There is substantial doctrinal dispute between the LDS Church and its offshoots as to whether celestial marriage is plural or monogamous. Some critics argue that the official Mormon scripture, Doctrine and Covenants section 132,[1] which describes celestial marriage, specifies that only plural marriages qualify. Others argue that the text indicates "a wife", which would mean that any temple sealing ordinance of marriage could qualify. 
The latter view is supported by the official History of the Church, which indicates that marriage for eternity was monogamous except in "some circumstances":[10] 
He knew the voice of God—he knew the commandment of the Almighty to him was to go forward—to set the example, and establish Celestial plural marriage. He knew that he had not only his own prejudices and pre-possessions to combat and to overcome, but those of the whole Christian world...; but God ... had given the commandment.[11] Nevertheless, it is correct that "celestial marriage" was often used to refer to plural marriage.[12][13][14] 
A concept of celestial marriage was described by Emanuel Swedenborg as early as 1749. Swedenborg's Latin term conjugium coeleste was translated as "celestial marriage" by John Clowes in 1782. Two more recent translators have preferred the term "heavenly marriage."[15][16] In all his authoritative writing,[17] Swedenborg only mentions the term celestial marriage twice.[18][19] 
In Matthew 22:28–30, Jesus is asked about the continuing state of marriage after death and he replies that after the resurrection of the dead "people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven." Mormons do not interpret Jesus' statement as meaning "that marriages will not exist after the Resurrection, but that marriages will not be performed after the Resurrection; for all questions of marital status must be settled before that time."[9] Thus, Mormons believe that only mortals can be the subject of an eternal marriage ordinance; mortals may receive the ordinance for themselves or by proxy for those who have already died. 
Mormonism and Nicene Christianity (often called mainstream Christianity)[1] have a complex theological, historical, and sociological relationship. Mormons express their doctrines using standard biblical terminology and have similar views about the nature of Jesus Christ's atonement, bodily resurrection, and Second Coming as traditional Christianity. Nevertheless, most Mormons do not accept the Trinitarian doctrine of Nicene Christianity, codified in the Nicene and Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creeds of 325 and 381.[2] Although Mormons consider the Protestant Bible as scripture, they do not believe in biblical inerrancy. 
They have also adopted additional scriptures to the Bible that they believe to have been divinely revealed to Joseph Smith,[3][4][5] including the Book of Mormon,[3][4][5] the Doctrine and Covenants,[3] and the Pearl of Great Price.[3] Mormons practice baptism and celebrate the sacrament, but they also participate in other religious rituals. 
Mormons self-identify as Christians.[6] 
The Book of Mormon (1830), which codifies the earliest Mormon doctrine, was intended, in part, to settle ongoing doctrinal disputes among contemporary Christian denominations[23] and to create a single shared theology.[24] Joseph Smith believed in the Bible[25] and shared the Protestant tradition that the Bible (excluding the Apocrypha) was originally revealed by God to humanity[26] and had contained the "fulness of the gospel". 
Nevertheless, Smith believed the Bible of his era had degenerated from its original form. Smith blamed the Catholic Church for the loss of biblical books and for introducing corruptions and obfuscations in the biblical text.[27] Smith said that the Book of Mormon revealed "plain and precious things that had been taken away" from the Bible.[28] Smith also completed an unpublished revision of the Bible in 1833,[29] which he said corrected many of these errors,[30] and added inspired commentary.[31] Smith endowed the Book of Mormon with status equal to the Bible.[32] 
Views on the Nature of God in early Mormonism has been a matter of debate. Thomas G. Alexander argues that early Mormon theology was "essentially trinitarian",[33] A statement in the Lectures on Faith is used to defend this belief: 
There are two personages who constitute the great, matchless, governing, and supreme power over all things, by whom all things were created and made, that are created and made. They are the Father and the Son-the Father being a personage of spirit, glory, and power possessing all perfection and fullness, the Son, who was in the bosom of the Father, a personage of tabernacle.[34] 
It is possible that Joseph Smith simply did not understand the corporeal or physical nature of God at the time the Lectures on Faith were delivered. His knowledge of things-like that of all men and women-was often incremental, and his development in understanding was therefore a "line upon line" development. As a result of the First Vision, the boy prophet knew that the heavens were no longer sealed; that satan was more than myth or metaphor; and that the Father and Son were separate and distinct personages.[35] 
They (The Mormons) believe that the true God is a material being, composed of body and parts; and that when the Creator formed Adam in his own image, he made him about the size and shape of God himself.[36] 
Early Mormon soteriology, although not following a preexisting tradition, was generally Arminian in tendency.[38] Early Mormonism agreed with Methodists and the Disciples of Christ in rejecting Calvinistic doctrines in favor of Christian perfection and free will (called free agency).[39] Also, while the Book of Mormon affirmed the doctrine of original sin,[40] it also agrees with other Arminian denominations that children are incapable of sin and in a state of grace.[41][42] 
Mormonism arose in the 1820s during a period of radical reform and experimentation within American Protestantism, and Mormonism is integrally connected to that religious environment.[1][2][20][21] As a form of Christian primitivism, the new faith was one among several contemporary religious movements that claimed to restore Christianity to its condition at the time of the Twelve Apostles.[12][22] 
After Kosala, Nemade presented a different protagonist, Changadev Patil, through his four novels Bidhar (Marathi: बिढार),[5] Hool (Marathi: हूल), Jarila (Marathi: जरीला) and Jhool (Marathi: झूल). 
Another tetralogy begins with Hindu – Jagnyachi Samruddha Adgal (Marathi: हिंदू – जगण्याची समृद्ध अडगळ) in 2010 having Khanderao, the archaeologist as its protagonist. 
The differences between Sangvikar and Patil are not confined to just their age, profession, habits, and intellectual and emotional perception: While Sangvikar at times keeps the world at bay or even rejects the world, Patil is all for the world and is forever engaged in confronting and understanding it. Sangvikar is mercurial, Patil is more realistic, whereas Khanderao's consciousness moves across 5000 years to Indus Valley culture in the Hindu tetralogy. 
As a critic, Nemade's contribution rests in initiating Deshivad, a theory that negates globalisation or internationalism, asserting the value of writers' native heritage, indicating that Marathi literature ought to try to revive its native base and explore its indigenous sources. Nemade antagonised his contemporaries by contending that the short story is a genre inferior to that of the novel. 
Nemade won the prestigious Jnanpith Award in February 2015. He was the fourth laureate receiving the award for work in Marathi language.[6] 
Winner of the Sahitya Akademi Award, he was conferred with Padma Shri in 2011 by Government of India.[7] 
This was followed by a tetralogy consisting of novels Bidhar, Hool, Jareela and Jhool. In 2013, Nemade published his magnum opus titled Hindu: Jagnyachi Samruddha Adgal (Marathi: हिंदू: जगण्याची समृद्ध अडगळ) which is regarded as his masterpiece. Nemade is a recipient of the Sahitya Akademi Award as well as the Jnanapith Award, the highest literary honour in India. 
Nemade was born on 27 May 1938 in the village of Sangavi in the Khandesh region of Maharashtra. After doing his matriculation, he moved to Pune, and received his BA from Fergusson College in Pune and MA in Linguistics from Deccan College in Pune and English Literature from the Mumbai University in Mumbai. He received PhD and D.Lit. degrees from North Maharashtra University.[2] 
Nemade worked as a college teacher in several parts of Maharashtra. He spent a year in London teaching Marathi at the School of Oriental and African Studies. 
From 1973 to 1986, he taught English at Marathwada University in Aurangabad. In 1987, he was appointed as professor and head of department of English at Goa University. In 1991, he joined Mumbai University,[1] from where he retired as the Gurudeo Tagore Chair for comparative literature studies.[3] During 1960s, Nemade edited Marathi magazine Vacha.[citation needed] 
Nemade wrote his first novel Kosala (Marathi: कोसला)[4] in 1963. It is a fictitious autobiographical novel of one Pandurang Sangvikar, a youth from rural Maharashtra who studies in a college in Pune; but it is loosely based on Nemade's own life in his youth. 
Sizwe Banzi Is Dead (originally produced and published as: Sizwe Bansi is Dead) is a play by Athol Fugard, written collaboratively with two South African actors, John Kani and Winston Ntshona, both of whom appeared in the original production. 
Its world première occurred on 8 October 1972 at the Space Theatre, Cape Town, South Africa. Its subsequent British première won a London Theatre Critics Award for the Best Play of 1974.[citation needed] Its American première occurred at the Edison Theatre, in New York City, on 13 November 1974.[1] It has been ranked among the best plays ever made by The Independent, where it was described as a "deceptively light and humane play that outlasts the apartheid era."[2] 
The genesis of Sizwe Bansi Is Dead can be traced to Fugard’s experiences as a law clerk at the Native Commissioner’s Court in Johannesburg. At that time it was required that every black and colored citizen over the age of sixteen carried [sic] an identity book that restricted employment and travel within the country. In court, Fugard saw the repercussions of this law: blacks were sent to jail at an alarming rate. 
Although these restrictions are specifically South African, critics have noted that the play’s greater theme of identity is universal. Critics and scholars have also observed that Sizwe Bansi Is Dead contains elements of absurdism, especially its sparse setting and surreal subject matter.[3] 
The play opens in the photography studio of a man named Styles. The studio is located in New Brighton, Port Elizabeth, South Africa. 
After reading a newspaper article on an automobile plant, Styles tells a humorous story to the audience about an incident that occurred when he worked at the Ford Motor Company. 
In the letter, Sizwe tells his wife that Sizwe Banzi is dead. He writes that when he arrived in Port Elizabeth from their home in King William’s Town, he stayed with a friend named Zola who tried to help Sizwe find a job. His employment search was unsuccessful; as a result, he was told by the authorities that he must leave in three days. 
The play returns to the present time. 
Staying at Buntu’s house, Sizwe tells Buntu about his problems — unless a miracle happens, he will have to leave town in three days. Buntu is sympathetic to the problem and suggests he work in the mines in King William’s Town. 
Sizwe rejects the idea as too dangerous. Buntu decides to take him out for a treat at Sky’s place, a local bar. 
The focus switches back to Sizwe as he continues to compose the letter to his wife. He describes his experiences at Sky’s shebeen, where he was served alcohol by a woman in a respectful manner. 
Sizwe finishes dictating the letter to his wife. In it, he tells her that Buntu is helping him get a lodger’s permit. The scene shifts back to Styles’ photography studio; Sizwe is getting his picture taken. 
Articles relating to Western culture, the heritage of social norms, ethical values, traditional customs, belief systems, political systems, artifacts and technologies of the Western world. The term also applies beyond Europe to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to Western Europe by immigration, colonization, or influence. For example, Western culture includes determinated countries in the Americas and Oceania. 
Ndebele house painting is a style of African art practised by the Southern Ndebele people of South Africa. It is predominantly practised by the Ndebele women when painting homes. 
These very simple-looking painted houses are really a complex system of tradition and creation. This painted tradition is still alive today. As every generation passes it down little changes begin to exist. 
This is their way of communication and expression through their home. The women work long and hard to finish these walls and are noticed by the outside community because of their talent and expression.[citation needed] 
The loss of the war brought on a harsh life and horrible punishments for the Ndebele. Through those hard times expressive symbols were generated by the suffering people expressing their grief. These symbols were the beginning of the African art form.[citation needed] 
Although sharing the same name, they should not be confused with (Mzilikazi's) Northern Ndebele people of modern Zimbabwe, a breakaway from the Zulu nation, with whom they came into contact only after Mfecane. Northern Ndebele people speak the Ndebele language.[1] Mzilikazi's Khumalo clan (later called the Ndebele) have a different history (see Zimbabwean Ndebele language) and their language is more similar to Zulu and Xhosa.[2] Southern Ndebele mainly inhabit the provinces of Mpumalanga, Gauteng and Limpopo, all of which are in the northeast of the country. 
The Constitution of South Africa stipulates that all South Africans have a right to identify with their own language, and points out that tribal affiliations or "ethnicity" is identifiable mostly through a common language; hence the recognition of groups such as, for example the Xhosas who are united by isiXhosa; Zulus who are united by isiZulu; Vendas who are united by Tshivenda; and the Sothos who are united by Sesotho. The various groups who speak the Xitsonga language or one of its dialects are therefore also united by the language and take its name from it, hence Constitutionally they are the Tsonga people (Vatsonga). There are also other Tsonga groups in parts of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Swaziland. 
The Tsonga traditional economy is based on mixed agriculture and pastoralism. Cassava is the staple; corn (maize), millet, sorghum, and other crops are also grown. Women do much of the agricultural work, while men and teenage boys take care of domestic animals (a herd of cows, sheep, and goats) although some men grow cash crops. 
The Tsonga people (Tsonga: Vatsonga) are a Bantu ethnic group native mainly to Southern Mozambique and South Africa (Limpopo and Mpumalanga). 
They speak Xitsonga, a Southern Bantu language. A very small number of Tsonga people are also found in Zimbabwe and Northern Eswatini. 
The Tsonga people of South Africa share some history with the Tsonga people of Southern Mozambique; however they differ culturally and linguistically. 
Tsonga men traditionally attend the initiation school for circumcision called Matlala (KaMatlala) or Ngoma (e Ngomeni) after which they are regarded as men. Young teenage girls attend an initiation school that old Vatsonga women lead called Khomba, and initiates are therefore called tikhomba (khomba- singular, tikhomba- plural). Only virgins are allowed to attend this initiation school where they will be taught more about womanhood, how to carry themselves as tikhomba in the community, and they are also readied for marriage. 
The Tsonga people originated from Central and East Africa somewhere between AD 200 and 500, and have been migrating in-and-out of South Africa for over a thousand (1,000) years. 
Initially, the Tsonga people settled on the coastal plains of Northern Mozambique but finally settled in the Transvaal Province and around parts of St Lucia Bay in South Africa from as early as the 1300s.[2] One of the earliest reputable written accounts of the Tsonga people is by Henri Philipe (HP) Junod titled "Matimu ya Vatsonga 1498-1650" which was formally published in 1977, and it speaks of the earliest Tsonga kingdoms. Before this, the older Henri Alexandri (HA) Junod released his work titled "The life of a South African Tribe" which was first published under two volumes in 1912-1913 and re-published in 1927.

Mingles were a type of mint chocolates made by Bendicks and sold in the UK from 2002. 
The chocolates were all made in the UK in a factory in Winchester. In April 2009 August Storck confirmed it was shutting the factory at the end of July and relocating production to Ohrdruf, its Eastern German plant. This would result in a loss of more than 80 jobs although it would continue to employ over 30 staff in Winchester to support marketing and sales of its brands in the UK. 
The varieties of Mingles were changed for Christmas 2007, and were then: 
They could either be bought in a standard carton box, or a tall cylindrical tin. All of which were green. 
The Gokwe Region consists of the land in the area around Gokwe centre that was formerly under the control of the Shangwe people,[1][2] a Shona-speaking group, which lay in the northern part of the Midlands province of northwestern Zimbabwe, and is now broken up into Gokwe South District and Gokwe North District. A number of other groups live in the area, including the Tonga, and Ndebele.[3] 
Nkayi North District lies to the south. A researcher noted in 1998, that the Nkayi-Gokwe border had hardened even before independence when Shona-speaking auxiliary forces had been recruited in Gokwe and used against Nkayi in explicitly tribal attacks.[4] 
Kwekwe High School is a high school in the city of Kwekwe, in the Midlands Region of Zimbabwe. It was known until 1982 as Que Que High School. The school motto is Non Sibi Sed Omnibus (not for one but for us all). 
Kwekwe High is an co-ed interracial school that offers education from Form 1 up to Form 6 and offers sports such as rugby, cricket, tennis, basketball, swimming, field hockey, netball and volleyball. The school was founded in the early twentieth century, and was a combined primary and secondary school until the late 1920s when it was separated. At its inception the school mainly served the children of white employees of the Globe and Phoenix Gold Mine and of industries based on nearby deposits of iron and chromite, along with the children of local white farmers and ranchers. 
The school was opened to students of all races in 1980. It has some 1,500 students and 50 teachers, with six of them teaching mathematics. The class sizes are usually between 40 and 43 students per class.[1] 
In 2004, the school hosted finals of both the National Association of School Heads (NASH) middle and high school soccer tournament [2] and the Olivine Industries Schools National Netball Tournament.[3] The current headmaster is Mr. Shumba. 
The school has 2 hostels (Davern Port and Davey House) which accommodate approximately 300 termly boarding students. Davern Port is the girls hostel and the current hostel mistress is Mrs Mukwananzi and Davey House is the boys hostel and the current hostel master is Mr P. Muchechemera. The school is located just opposite Fitchlea suburb; it is situated along Kwekwe - Gweru highway. 
Born in Lagos, Nigeria and raised in London, he played collegiately for the Pacific Tigers in Stockton, California. Olowokandi was selected as the first overall pick of the 1998 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Clippers. He played professionally until 2007, when he was forced to retire due to severe hernia and knee injuries. 
In 2001, Olowokandi and his Clippers teammates participated in the BasketBowl Challenge at Keystone Lanes in Norwalk, to raise funds for the Los Angeles Clippers Foundation and Children's Hospital Los Angeles.[43] 
During Thanksgiving of 2006, Olowokandi volunteered his time at the Boston Children's Hospital and served meals for over 200 homeless people at the Pine Street Inn in Boston.[44] He has also donated to various charities and hospitals, including over $100,000 to the Children's Hospital Los Angeles for a new incubator for premature newborn infants. Many of Olowokandi's charitable projects were undisclosed and done privately without his teams' affiliations.[45] 
Due to his underwhelming career, he is considered one of the biggest draft busts in NBA history.[1] 
Olowokandi was born in Lagos, Nigeria, as the oldest of five children.[2] His father, Ezekiel, was a Nigerian diplomat.[2][3] His family moved to London when he was 4. Olowokandi has Nigerian citizenship and did not hold a British passport as of 2004.[4] 
Olowokandi then entered Brunel University as a mechanical engineering major, where he was an athlete in track and field, cricket, and rugby union.[1][7] He had a tryout with the Thames Valley Tigers of the Budweiser Basketball League but did not receive a contract.[8] 
Baby food is any soft, easily consumed food other than breastmilk or infant formula that is made specifically for human babies between four and six months and two years old. The food comes in many varieties and flavors that are purchased ready-made from producers, or it may be table food eaten by the family that has been mashed or otherwise broken down. 
As of 2011, the World Health Organization, UNICEF and many national health agencies recommended waiting until six months of age before starting a child on food;[1] individual babies may differ greatly from this guideline based on their unique developmental progress. Baby food can be given when the child is developmentally ready to eat. Signs of readiness include the ability to sit without help, loss of tongue thrust, and the display of active interest in food that others are eating. 
Babies may be started directly on normal family food if attention is given to choking hazards; this is called baby-led weaning. Because breastmilk takes on the flavor of foods eaten by the mother,[9] these foods are especially good choices.[10] 
Cereals On a typical day about half of American babies aged four and five months old are fed infant cereal. 
The baby may have eaten as little as one small bite of infant cereal, or even as little as one small bite of a food that contains infant cereal mixed with other foods. Other types of grain-based foods are rare at that age. 
About 90% of babies aged six to twelve months eat some type of grain, although only half eat infant cereal. 
The others eat rice, bread, crackers, pasta, or cereal designed for older children.[11] Fruits On any given day, about 20% of babies aged four and five months eat some type of fruit, usually a prepared baby food.[11] As with all of these, this may represent as little as one small bite of fruit or a food partly composed of fruit. Two-thirds of babies aged six to nine months, and between 75% and 85% of babies and toddlers older than nine months, eat some type of fruit. 
At age six to nine months, half of babies are eating prepared baby food fruits, but toddlers aged 12 months and older primarily eat non-baby food fruits, such as fresh bananas or canned fruits. Apple and bananas are common fruits for babies of all ages. 
Fruit juice, primarily apple and grape juice, is usually introduced later than fruit, and about half of older babies and toddlers drink some type of 100% fruit juice.[11] Vegetables In a typical day, about a quarter of babies aged four and five months eat some type of vegetable at least once, almost always prepared baby food, and usually a yellow or orange vegetable like carrots, pumpkin, sweet potatoes, and winter squash.[11] At age six to nine months, about 60% of babies and about 70% older babies and toddlers eat vegetables, with baby food vegetables rapidly being replaced by cooked vegetables after about nine months. 
Raw vegetables are uncommon for all babies and toddlers. 
By the first birthday, almost a third of babies eat potatoes on a given day.[11] Meat Very few four- and five-month-old American babies eat meat or other protein source (excluding milk).[11] Six- to nine-month-old babies mostly eat meat as part of a baby food that contains a small amount of meat along with vegetables or grains. 
About three-quarters of nine- to twelve-month-old babies are given either meat or another protein source, such as eggs, cheese, yogurt, beans, or nuts. 
More than 90% of babies aged 12 to 18 months old, and nearly all toddlers older than that, are given a protein source at least once a day. 
Almost three-quarters of these toddlers are given a non-baby food meat; prepared baby food meat (by itself) is uncommon at any age.[11] Sweet and salty foods Sweet and salty foods are uncommon for babies.[11] Compared to a prior study in 2002, the number of babies under age nine months that received any sort of sweetened food, snack, or beverage, had dropped by nearly half. 
At age nine to twelve months, fewer than half of babies are given sweetened foods like cookies, ice cream, or fruit-flavored drinks. 
Prepared baby food desserts are uncommon at any age, but are given to almost 12% of babies age nine to twelve months.[11] 
Some commercial baby food companies have expanded their lines to produce specialty foods for toddlers from the age of about 12 months to two and a half years old.[1] These include juice, cereal, small microwaveable meals, baked goods, and other foods that have been formulated and marketed for toddlers. 
Parents and/or caregivers may perceive up to half of toddlers as being "picky" or "faddy", with the peak around 24 months.[14][15] Adults who hold this opinion often stop offering new foods to the child after only three to five attempts, rather than continuing to offer the food until the child has tasted it eight to fifteen times. They may also engage in counterproductive behaviors, such as offering appetite-suppressing milk or other favorite foods as an alternative, or trying to force or bribe the child into eating.[16] 
Baby food varies from culture to culture. In many cultures, pastes of a grain and liquids are the first baby food. In human history and presently with many cultures around the world, babies are fed food premasticated by the caretaker of the baby in order to pulverise the food and start the digestion process.[17] An infant's first bite of solid food is ceremonial and holds religious importance in many cultures. 
An example of this is annaprashan, a Hindu ritual where the infant is fed a sweetened rice porridge, usually blessed, by an elder family member. Similar rites of passage are practiced across Asia, including the Bengal region, Vietnam, and Thailand.[citation needed] 
As a global public health recommendation, the World Health Organization recommends that infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. Most six-month-old infants are physiologically and developmentally ready for new foods, textures and modes of feeding.[2] Experts advising the World Health Assembly have provided evidence that introducing solids earlier than six months increases babies' chances of illness, without improving growth.[3] 
Some commercial baby foods have been criticized for their contents and cost.[27] 
Over the decades, there have been multiple recalls of baby foods because of concerns about contamination or spoilage. In 1984 and 1986, Gerber was involved in a scandal over glass baby food jars breaking in transit, which dramatically affected its sales and profitability, although the US Food and Drug Administration later concluded that the company was not at fault.[1] In 1987, Beechnut paid US$25 million to resolve charges of selling adulterated apple juice in the early 1980s.[12] In 2011, Nestlé France decided to recall a batch of P'tit pot baby food as a precautionary measure after a customer reportedly found glass shards in one of their jars. 
An investigation into the incident's scope led the company to conclude that it had been an isolated occurrence and that the rest of the batch had not been affected.[28] 
Commercial baby food in the United States is dominated by Gerber, which had about 70% of the American market share in 1996.[1] Beechnut had about 15% of the market, and Heinz had about 10%. Heinz's Earth's Best, the largest brand of organic baby food, had about 2% of the American market share.[12] 
In Canada sodium content in infant food is regulated; strained fruit, fruit juice, fruit drink, and cereal cannot be sold if sodium has been added (excluding strained desserts). Foods naturally containing sodium are limited to 0.05 - 0.25 grams per 100 grams of food, depending on the type of infant food.[4] 
If there is a family history of allergies, one may wish to introduce only one new food at a time, leaving a few days in between to notice any reactions that would indicate a food allergy or sensitivity. This way, if the child is unable to tolerate a certain food, it can be determined which food is causing the reaction.[citation needed] 
Early Christian writers have sometimes focused on the spilling seed, and the sexual act being used for non-procreational purposes. This interpretation was held by several early Christian apologists. Jerome, for example, argued: 
The papal encyclical Casti connubii (1930) invokes this Biblical text in support of the teaching of the Catholic Church against contracepted sex. 
Making reference to Onan's offense to identify masturbation as sinful, in his Commentary on Genesis, John Calvin wrote that "the voluntary spilling of semen outside of intercourse between a man and a woman is a monstrous thing. Deliberately to withdraw from coitus in order that semen may fall on the ground is double monstrous."[11][12] Methodism founder John Wesley, according to Bryan C. Hodge, "believed that any waste of the semen in an unproductive sexual act, whether that should be in the form of masturbation or coitus interruptus, as in the case of Onan, destroyed the souls of the individuals who practice it".[13] He writes his Thoughts on the Sin of Onan (1767), which was reproduced as A Word to Whom it May Concern on 1779, as an attempt to censor a work by Samuel-Auguste Tissot.[14] In that writing, Wesley warns about "the dangers of self pollution", the bad physical and mental effects of masturbation,[15][14] writes many such cases along with the treatment recommendations.[16] 
After Onan's brother Er was slain by God, his father Judah told him to fulfill his duty to his brother by entering into a levirate marriage with his brother's widow Tamar to give her offspring. Religion professor Tikva Frymer-Kensky has pointed out the economic repercussions of a levirate marriage: any son born to Tamar would be deemed the heir of the deceased Er, and able to claim the firstborn's double share of inheritance. However, if Er were childless, or only had daughters, Onan would have inherited as the oldest surviving son.[3] 
When Onan had sex with Tamar, he withdrew before he ejaculated[4] and "spilled his seed on the ground", since any child born would not legally be considered his heir.[5] The next statement in the Bible says that Onan did evil and that God slew him.[6] 
One opinion expressed in the Talmud argues that this was where the death penalty's imposition originated.[7] However, the Levitical regulations concerning ejaculation, whether as a result of sexual intercourse[8] or not,[9] merely prescribe a ritual washing, and remaining ritually impure until the next day began on the following evening. 
Adultery (from Latin adulterium) is extramarital sex that is considered objectionable on social, religious, moral, or legal grounds. Although the sexual activities that constitute adultery vary, as well as the social, religious, and legal consequences, the concept exists in many cultures and is similar in Christianity, Judaism and Islam.[1] Adultery is viewed by many jurisdictions as offensive to public morals, being a mistreatment of the marriage relationship.[2][3] 
However, even in jurisdictions that have decriminalised adultery, it may still have legal consequences, particularly in jurisdictions with fault-based divorce laws, where adultery almost always constitutes a ground for divorce and may be a factor in property settlement, the custody of children, the denial of alimony, etc. Adultery is not a ground for divorce in jurisdictions which have adopted a no-fault divorce model. 
Kiwifruit by species A = A. arguta, C = A. chinensis, D = A. deliciosa, E = A. eriantha, I = A. indochinensis, P = A. polygama, S = A. setosa. 
Kiwifruit (commonly shortened to kiwi in North America and continental Europe) or Chinese gooseberry is the edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.[1][2] The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa 'Hayward')[3] is oval, about the size of a large hen's egg: 5–8 centimetres (2–3 inches) in length and 4.5–5.5 cm (1+3⁄4–2+1⁄4 in) in diameter. It has a thin, fuzzy, fibrous, tart but edible light brown skin and light green or golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft texture with a sweet and unique flavour. 
In 2018, China produced half of the world total of kiwifruit. 
Kiwifruit is native to central and eastern China.[1] The first recorded description of the kiwifruit dates to the 12th century during the Song dynasty.[4] In the early 20th century, cultivation of kiwifruit spread from China to New Zealand, where the first commercial plantings occurred.[1] The fruit became popular with British and American servicemen stationed in New Zealand during World War II, and later became commonly exported, first to Great Britain and then to California in the 1960s.[1][5] 
Early varieties were described in a 1904 nursery catalogue as having "...edible fruits the size of walnuts, and the flavour of ripe gooseberries",[6] leading to the name Chinese gooseberry.[1] In 1962, New Zealand growers began calling it "kiwifruit" for export marketing, a name commercially adopted in 1974.[1] In New Zealand and Australia, the word "kiwi" alone refers to the kiwi bird or is used as a nickname for New Zealanders; it is almost never used to refer to the fruit.[3][7] Kiwifruit has since become a common name for all commercially grown green kiwifruit from the genus Actinidia.[1] In the United States and Canada, the shortened name kiwi is commonly used when referring to the fruit.[8][9] 
Music by year. 
Der Diktator (The Dictator) is a tragic opera in one act with words and music by Ernst Krenek, his Op. 49 and the first of three one-acters (with Das geheime Königreich and Schwergewicht, oder Die Ehre der Nation) which premiered on 6 May 1928 at the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden as part of the Festspiele Wiesbaden.[1] The score is inscribed with the date of completion, 28 August 1926. 
The title character is loosely based on Benito Mussolini, although the story is not deliberately political; Krenek later described it as "an anecdote from the private life of the 'strong man'.[2] "Only from the irrational does he retreat, not so much out of fear but because he can do nothing with it, he cannot dominate it."[3] 
Maria is admiring the summer evening from the hospital, when the Dictator walks a courier out of the hotel, instructing him to deliver a declaration of war. Maria shrinks from his gaze, but he is fascinated. Charlotte comes out, upset at the news: "You already have too many enemies"; he tells her that her fears for him are a form of jealousy and toasts a coming victory while the women join in a trio, Maria complaining about his unbearable eyes and Charlotte singing that when his luck has run out he will be hers again. 
All go inside, and the officer is wheeled out, crying for air and light. He tells Maria, who follows, the story of his blinding by poison gas. She promises to avenge him by killing his commander and they sing a duet: "..and these hands, forced to shed so much innocent blood, let me dip them in the blood of the guilty one." (see example below)

After Majeed's death 15 years later, his wife Rabea Begum established a charitable trust in the name of herself and their two sons.[8] 
Hamdard Laboratories India has launched two ready to drink variants in India namely RoohAfza Fusion and RoohAfza Milkshake.[15][16][17][18] 
Rooh Afza (Hindi: रूह अफ़ज़ा; Urdu: روح افزا‎; Bengali: রূহ আফজা) (Soul Refresher) is a concentrated squash.[1] It was formulated in 1906 in Ghaziabad, British India by Hakim Hafiz Abdul Majeed,[2][3][4] and launched from Old Delhi, India. Currently, Rooh Afza is manufactured by the companies founded by him and his sons, Hamdard Laboratories, India, Hamdard Laboratories (Waqf) Pakistan and Hamdard Laboratories (WAQF), Bangladesh. 
Since 1948, the company has been manufacturing the product in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.[2] 
In 1906, he wanted to create a herbal mix that would help Delhi's people stay cool in the summer. He selected herbs and syrups from traditional Unani medicine and created a drink that would help counter heat strokes and prevent water loss in people. An artist, Mirza Noor Ahmad, designed the labels of Rooh Afza in many colours in 1910. 
Progress in development and refining the original recipe continued all along until the final drink emerged.[1] 
His period is not certain[1] but he probably flourished in or after the 6th century CE. Some scholars such as A. S. Altekar, K. P. Jayaswal and Sten Konow theorized that Vishakhadatta was a contemporary of Chandragupta II, and lived in late 4th century to early 5th century. But this view has been challenged by other scholars, including Moriz Winternitz and R. C. Majumdar.[2] 
Mudrārākṣasa ("Rákshasa's Ring") is Vishakhadatta’s only surviving play, although there exist fragments of another work ascribed to him.[3] Vishakhadatta has stressed upon historical facts in the Mudrarakshasa, a play dealing with the time of the Maurya Dynasty.[4] 
The titles of Vishakhadatta’s father and grandfather do indicate one point of interest: that he came from a princely family, certain to have been involved in political administration at least at a local level. It seems very possible, in fact, that Vishakhadatta came to literature from the world of affairs. 
Buruuli (place) is a general term used to refer to the area where the Baruuli live. It is located in the district of Nakasongola, as well as in Bugerere Kayunga District. The Baruuli speak the Ruruuli language, a Bantu language closely related to Lunyala, a language spoken by the Banyala of Kayunga District. 
The Baruuli are ruled and governed by Ssabaluuli Mwogezi, who was crowned as their Kabaka by the president of Uganda Yoweri Kaguta Museveni. 
Buruuli is a semi desert area where Lake Kyoga is their main source of food, employment and wealth. The Baruuli people are herdsmen, farmers, fishermen and charcoal burners. 
They too carry out trade with the neighborhood in fish, charcoal and food. Their staple food is sweet potatoes and matooke. They too grow millet, peanuts, yams, cassava, and other kinds of vegetables. 
Their land is very dry almost all months but they do farming near the shores of their cherished lake Kyoga. 
They are a Bantu speaking tribe with riddles and parables and are very sociable people. Sometimes, these Bantu speaking people refer to themselves-and by others as Baduuli which means “Boasters”. 
This is a term that has been used for long ever since the creation of their territories. 
Every family had a banana plantation and cows and this made them very happy and boastful to the other tribes they associated and lived with. All they cherished was their long-horned cows similar to the Nsagala-long horned cows of the Banyankole of Bushenyi and Mbarara Districts in the Western Uganda. 
These cows were a source of wealth both to a family and their relatives. They used to exchange cows for other breeds of cattle, sheep and goats. 
They were also used in the marriage ceremonies as the groom was supposed to pay four cows to the family of the bride. Lake Kyoga remains their cherished asset because it is regarded as their heart. Without it, they can not get sauce, money and other necessities of life. 
Commercially, the Baruuli people of Nakasongola district trade with the neighbors who include the Langi, Acholi, Baganda, Banyoro and Bakenyi and Basoga. Exchange of fish for boats, cows for other necessities were carried out, but is extinct now. 
Mormon Enigma: Emma Hale Smith, Prophet's Wife, "Elect Lady," Polygamy's Foe is a biography of Emma Hale Smith, wife of Joseph Smith Jr., written by Linda King Newell and Valeen Tippetts Avery. 
Generally accepted as a groundbreaking biography, the book places Emma Smith into a context that has better explained the trials and sacrifices of the members of the early Latter Day Saint church. The work made possible, along with other more recent historical works, a major reinterpretation of the formative period of Mormonism. 
The book won the 1984 Best Book Award for interpretive history by the Mormon History Association.[1] 
Early leaders in Utah castigated Emma from their pulpits for opposing Brigham Young and the practice of polygamy, and for lending support to the Reorganization. As these attitudes filtered down through the years, Emma was virtually written out of official Utah histories. In this biography, we have attempted to reconstruct the full story of this remarkable and much misunderstood woman's experiences.[citation needed]

Te'udat Bagrut (Hebrew: תעודת בגרות‎, lit. "maturity certificate", Arabic: شهادة بجروت) is a certificate that attests that a student has successfully passed Israel's high school matriculation examination. Bagrut is a prerequisite for higher education in Israel.[1] 
In order to receive a "full" matriculation certificate, the student must take and pass at least one subject matter exam at the 5-unit level of difficulty and earn a total of at least 21 combined study units in all bagrut exams taken. Correspondingly, the make-up of students' classes during their high school years is matched to the students' expected units of study in which they will be tested in their bagrut exams. So for example, a student who is planning to take the 5-unit mathematics exam will take mathematics courses specifically designed for a 5-unit level of difficulty all throughout his or her high school career. 
65.5% of Israeli high school 2014 graduates, or other individuals studying for the 2014 exam (usually post-compulsory military service persons completing Bagrut requirements later in life in order to apply for higher education) had passed the requirements to be eligible to receive a Bagrut certificate. Of the overall population who was of high school graduation age in 2019, 76.1% were eligible to receive a Bagrut certificate.[5] 
A copy of the 2010 mathematics exam (in the four and five units levels) was leaked to students, but a teacher reported it to authorities and all tests were replaced.[6] 
A Bagrut certificate is awarded by the Israeli Ministry of Education to students who pass the ministry's required written (and in some cases oral) subject-matter examinations with a passing mark (55% or higher) in each exam. The Bagrut certificate however should not be confused with a high school diploma (te'udat g'mar tichon, Hebrew: תעודת גמר תיכון‎، Arabic: شهادة انهاء الثانويّة), which is a certificate awarded by the Ministry of Education attesting that a student has completed 12 years of study. Bagrut scores are one of the criteria examined in applications to elite military units and Israeli academic institutions.[2] Other criteria include students' high school grades and the Psychometric Entrance Test. 
Bagrut examinations assess knowledge on subjects studied in high school. 
The process of matriculation in Israel is supervised by the country's Ministry of Education. The exams of all compulsory subjects and most elective subjects are designed and written by the Ministry, thereby creating a standard measure of the students' knowledge throughout the country. In academically oriented high schools, the last two years of studies are geared to preparing students for the bagrut exams. 
Compulsory subjects[3] 
The Nyangatom also known as Dongiro and pejoratively as Bumé are Nilotic agro-pastoralists inhabiting the border of southwestern Ethiopia and southeastern South Sudan and in the Ilemi Triangle with populations residing in both countries.they are mixed farmers [2] They speak the Nyangatom language. 
The Nyangatom are members of the Ateker or Karamojong cluster that also contains the Turkana, Toposa, Karamojong, and Jie who speak closely related languages. They number approximately 30,000 [1] with populations in both South Sudan and Ethiopia. 
Many Nyangatom are nomadic, residing in mobile livestock villages that may migrate several times a year. A substantial number of Nyangatom also reside in semi-permanent villages. It is common for individuals to move between mobile cattle camps and semi-permanent villages.[2] 
The Nyangatom have intermittent conflict with many of their neighbors, especially the Turkana, Dassanetch, and Suri.[3] The Kenyan government provides some military support to the Turkana in these conflicts.[3] Despite the risk of intergroup conflict, many Nyangatom have bond friends with members of other groups and there are trade relationships between the Nyangatom and many of their neighbors. 
Along with other groups in the Lower Omo Valley, the Nyangatom face challenges to their future subsistence and cultural traditions due to large-scale agricultural projects occurring in their territory.[4][5] 
The traditional Indian meal was roti and beans, but the roti tended to fall apart as a take-away item. To solve this, they[who?] hollowed the centre portion of a loaf of white bread and filled it with curry, then capped the filling with the portion that was carved out.[7] The vegetarian version of the meal is sometimes known as a "beans bunny".[6] An alternate, albeit unlikely etymology is derived from a mondegreen of "bun" and "achar" (Indian pickles), though the latter are not usually included in the dish (unless as an accoutrement).[6] 
Bunny chows are popular amongst Indians and other ethnic groups in the Durban area. Bunny chows are commonly filled with curries made using traditional recipes from Durban: mutton or lamb curry, chicken curry, trotters & beans curry and beans curry. Other varieties found across the country using less traditional Durban-Indian food include chips with curry gravy, fried sausage, cheese, eggs and polony. 
These are all popular fillings; the original bunny chow was vegetarian. Bunny chows are often served with a side portion of salad containing grated carrot, chilli and onion salad. Commonly known as sambals, this includes chopped tomatoes, onions, and green chilies served with white vinegar. 
Other sides include Indian pickles, such as mango pickle, lime or lemon pickle, vegetable pickles and other seasonal varieties which are pickled. A key desirable characteristic of a bunny chow is seen when gravy from the curry fillings soaks into the walls of the bread. Sharing a single bunny chow is not uncommon. 
Bunny chows come in quarter, half and full loaves. When ordering a bunny chow in Durban, the local slang dictates that you need only ask for a "quarter mutton" (or flavour and size of your choice); colloquially, people would say, "Can I have a quarter mutton bunny?" Bunny chows are mainly eaten using the fingers; it is unusual to see locals use utensils when eating this dish. 
Bunny chows were historically packaged in the previous day's newspaper. This is no longer common, and takeaway bunnies are more typically sold in "bunny boxes" which retain heat and prevent leaks from the curry. 
Each year, the "Bunny Chow Barometer" is held in September on the south bank of the Umgeni River, just above Blue Lagoon (a popular Sunday picnic spot for Durban Indians), attracting numerous entrants from across the Durban Metro region to compete for the title of top bunny maker.[8] 
Bunny chow, often referred to simply as a bunny,[1] is a South African fast food dish consisting of a hollowed-out loaf of white bread filled with curry. 
It originated among Indian South Africans of Durban.[2] Throughout various South African communities one can find different versions of the bunny chow, which uses only a quarter loaf of bread and depending on which part of the country you are in, is sometimes called a scambane, kota ("quarter") or Shibobo; it is a name that it shares with sphatlho, a South African dish that evolved from the bunny chow.[3] 
The Bunny chow was created in Durban, South Africa. It is home to a large community of people of Indian origin. 
The precise origins of the food are disputed, although its creation has been dated to the 1940s.[4] It was also sold in Gwelo, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) during World War II and is still sold in the nearby town of Kadoma, formerly known as Gatooma. 
Stories of the origin of bunny chow date as far back as the migrant Indian workers' arrival in South Africa. One account suggests that said Indian laborers who came to work the sugar cane plantations of KwaZulu-Natal (Port Natal) required a way of carrying their lunches to the field; a hollowed-out loaf of bread was a convenient way to transport their vegetarian curries.[5] Meat-based fillings came later. The use of a loaf of white bread can also be ascribed to the lack of the traditional roti bread as well as its weak structure; thus the cheap loaf, widely available at local stores, would be an optimal substitute vessel for the curry. 
One story claims that a South African restaurant run by Banias (an Indian caste) first created the dish at a restaurant-café, called Kapitan's, on the corner of Victoria and Albert streets in Durban.[1] Another tale opines that the origin of this handheld dish was due to Indian golf caddies not being allowed to publicly carry sharp cutlery like knives during apartheid.[2] "Chow" in South African English is simply slang for "food" as well as the verb "to eat". 
Russell Marion Nelson Sr. (born September 9, 1924) is an American religious leader and retired surgeon who is the 17th and current president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).[4] Nelson was a member of the LDS Church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for nearly 34 years, and was the quorum president from 2015 to 2018. As church president, Nelson is accepted by the church as a prophet, seer, and revelator.[5] 
In August 2003, Nelson became the first member of the Quorum of the Twelve to visit Kazakhstan.[60] While there, Nelson visited government officials, was interviewed by Yuzhnaya Stalitsa television, and dedicated that country for the preaching of the gospel.[60] 
Nelson served in a variety of lay LDS leadership positions during his surgical career, beginning locally in Salt Lake City and then as the LDS Church's Sunday School General President from 1971 to 1979.[7] In 1984, Nelson and the American jurist Dallin H. Oaks were selected to fill two vacancies in the LDS Church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. LDS apostles serve full-time for life, and so Nelson retired from all of his prior professional positions. 
Russell M. Nelson was born on September 9, 1924, in Salt Lake City, Utah, to Marion Clavar Nelson (1897–1990)[8] and Floss Edna Nelson (née Anderson; 1893–1983).[9] He had two sisters, Marjory E. (1920–2016) and Enid (1926–2019), and a brother, Robert H. (1931–2014). Nelson's father was a reporter for the Deseret News and later became general manager of Gillham Advertising, Utah's earliest advertising agency.[10][11] His parents were not active in the Latter-day Saint faith while he was a youth, but they did send him to Sunday School,[12] and he was baptized a member of the LDS Church at age 16.[13] 
Malakal Airport (IATA: MAK, ICAO: HJMK) is an airport serving Malakal,[1] a city in Malakal County in the Eastern Nile[3] state of South Sudan. The airport is located just north of the city's central business district, adjacent to the main campus of Upper Nile University. Malakal is near the international border with the Republic of Sudan and the border with Ethiopia. 
Malakal is the smaller of two international airports in South Sudan. 
The largest, Juba International Airport, lies approximately 521 kilometres (281 NM) to the south in the capital city of Juba. 
As part of the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), the airport was a major staging point for United Nation operations to South Sudan and will continue to do so under the new United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) mandate.[4] 
The airport resides at an elevation of 1,291 feet (393 m) above mean sea level.[1][5] It has one runway designated 05/23 with an asphalt surface measuring 2,000 by 38 metres (6,562 ft × 125 ft).[1][6] 
Penile discharge is fluid that comes from the urethra at the end of the penis that is not urine, precum or semen.[2][3] 
A swab of the discharge is usually performed.[1] Other investigations may include tests for HIV, hepatitis and syphilis.[2] 
Treatment depends on the cause and any antibiotic prescribed depends on which infection is found.[1] Spread of infection is reduced by informing sexual partners so that they can also be treated, and not having sex (including oral or anal) until tests are completed and seven days have passed after treatment.[6] 
Common causes include infections due to gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis.[1] In gonorrhea the discharge may be white, yellow, or green.[4][5] 
A swab of the discharge is usually performed.[1] 
Treatment depends on the cause. 
Spread of infection is reduced by also treating sexual contacts.[1] 
Risk factors include being sexually active men under the age of 25, having a recent new sexual partner, or having unprotected sex.[1] 
Penile discharge is liquid from the urethra at the end of the penis that is not urine or semen.[1] The dripping of clear fluid when sexually excited is normal.[2] 
There may be pain or burning when passing urine, soreness inside the penis or feeling of wanting to pass urine frequently.[6] 
It is important to remember that these are general categories of sex crimes and may be defined in different ways and called by different terms varying by jurisdiction. Different types of sexual abuse involve: 
Violence is the exertion of physical force so as to kill, injure or abuse, such as murder or forceful human destruction of property or injury to persons or animals, usually intentional, and forceful verbal and emotional abuse that harms others. 
This category content related to gender 
Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between femininity and masculinity. 
Depending on the context, this may include sex-based social structures (i.e. gender roles) and gender identity.[1][2][3] Most cultures use a gender binary, having two genders (boys/men and girls/women);[4][5][6] those who exist outside these groups may fall under the umbrella term non-binary. Some societies have specific genders besides "man" and "woman", such as the hijras of South Asia; these are often referred to as third genders (and fourth genders, etc.). Most scholars agree that gender is a central characteristic for social organization.[7] 
Sexologist John Money is often regarded as the first to introduce a terminological distinction between biological sex and "gender role" (which, as originally defined, includes the concepts of both gender role and what would later become known as gender identity) in 1955[8][9] although Madison Bentley had already in 1945 defined gender as the "socialized obverse of sex",[10][11] and Simone de Beauvoir's 1949 book The Second Sex has been interpreted as the beginning of the distinction between sex and gender in feminist theory.[12][13] 
This category is for articles that describe gender as a social issue (cultural, political, etc.), and interactions between gender and the larger society. 
A society is a grouping of individuals, which is characterized by common interest and may have distinctive culture and institutions. Society can also be explained as an organized group of people associated together for religious, benevolent, cultural, scientific, political, patriotic, recreational, or other purposes. 
Articles relating to conspiracy theories, explanations for events or situations that invoke a conspiracy by sinister and powerful groups, often political in motivation, when other explanations are more probable. The term has a negative connotation, implying that the appeal to a conspiracy is based on prejudice or insufficient evidence. 
A theory provides an explanatory framework for some observation, and from the assumptions of the explanation follows a number of possible hypotheses that can be tested in order to provide support for, or challenge, the theory. 
For purposes of article inclusion, this category specifically only includes articles where the subject is mentioned in their article as actively promoting one of the conspiracy theories listed in the articles under Category:Conspiracy theories, and the promotion is a non-trivial, defining characteristic of the person. For example, the article Area 51 appears under Category:Conspiracy theories (C:CT), so someone who actively promotes conspiracy theories mentioned in that article would be classified here as a Conspiracy theorist. Theories without corresponding C:CT articles will not count for inclusion here. 
Conspiracy theories in North America. 
The Eye of Providence, or the all-seeing eye of God, seen here on the US$1 bill, has been taken by some to be evidence of a conspiracy involving the founders of the United States and the Illuminati.[1] 
A conspiracy theory can be local or international, focused on single events or covering multiple incidents and entire countries, regions and periods of history.[1] According to Ruseell Muirhead and Nancy Rosenblum, historically, traditional conspiracism has entailed a "theory", but over time, "conspiracy" and "theory" have become decoupled, as modern conspiracism is often without any kind of theory behind it.[59][60] 
A conspiracy theory is an explanation for an event or situation that invokes a conspiracy by sinister and powerful groups, often political in motivation,[2][3] when other explanations are more probable.[4][5] The term has a negative connotation, implying that the appeal to a conspiracy is based on prejudice or insufficient evidence.[6] A conspiracy theory is not the same as a conspiracy; instead, it refers to a hypothesized conspiracy with specific characteristics, such as an opposition to the mainstream consensus among those people (such as scientists or historians) who are qualified to evaluate its accuracy.[6][7] 
Articles relating to fake news, false or misleading information presented as news. It often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue. 
After high school, Webb attended an Indianapolis community college on a scholarship until his family moved to Cincinnati. He then transferred to nearby Northern Kentucky University.[6] 
Webb's first major investigative work appeared in 1980, when the Cincinnati Post published "The Coal Connection," a seventeen-part series by Webb and Post reporter Thomas Scheffey.[10] The series, which examined the murder of a coal company president with ties to organized crime, won the national Investigative Reporters and Editors Award for reporting from a small newspaper.[11] 
Gary Stephen Webb (August 31, 1955 – December 10, 2004) was an American investigative journalist. 
He began his career working for newspapers in Kentucky and Ohio, winning numerous awards, and building a strong reputation for investigative writing. Hired by the San Jose Mercury News, Webb contributed to the paper's Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of the Loma Prieta earthquake. 
The first detailed article on the series's claims appeared in The Washington Post in early October.[31] In their front-page article, reporters Roberto Suro and Walter Pincus wrote that "available information" did not support the series's claims and that "the rise of crack" was "a broad-based phenomenon" driven in numerous places by diverse players. The article discussed Webb's contacts with Ross's attorney and prosecution complaints of how Ross's defense had used Webb's series.[32] 
The Department of Justice Inspector-General's report was released on July 23, 1998. According to the report's "Epilogue," the report was completed in December 1997 but was not released because the DEA was still attempting to use Danilo Blandón in an investigation of international drug dealers and was concerned that the report would affect the viability of the investigation. When Attorney General Janet Reno determined that a delay was no longer necessary, the report was released unaltered.[57] 
The CIA Inspector-General's report was issued in two volumes. The first one, "The California Story," was issued in a classified version on December 17, 1997, and in an unclassified version on January 29, 1998. The second volume, "The Contra Story," was issued in a classified version on April 27, 1998, and in an unclassified version on October 8, 1998. 
The House Intelligence Committee issued its report in February 2000.[61] According to the report, it used Webb's reporting and writing as "key resources in focusing and refining the investigation." Like the CIA and Justice Department reports, it also found that neither Blandón, Meneses, nor Ross were associated with the CIA.[62] 
After his resignation from The Mercury News, Webb expanded the "Dark Alliance" series into a book that responded to the criticism of the series and described his experiences writing the story and dealing with the controversy. It was published in 1998 as Dark Alliance: The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion. A revised version was published in 1999 that incorporated Webb's response to the CIA and Justice Department reports. 
The February 2000 report by the House Intelligence Committee in turn considered the book's claims as well as the series' claims.[63] Dark Alliance was a 1998 Pen/Newman's Own First Amendment Award Finalist, 1998 San Francisco Chronicle bestseller, 1999 Bay Area Book Reviewers Award Finalist, and 1999 Firecracker Alternative Booksellers Award Winner in the Politics category. 
Webb was found dead in his Carmichael home on December 10, 2004, with two gunshot wounds to the head. His death was ruled a suicide by the Sacramento County coroner's office. According to a description of Webb's injuries in the Los Angeles Times, he shot himself with a .38 revolver, which he placed near his right ear. 
After a local newspaper reported that Webb had died from multiple gunshots, the coroner's office received so many calls asking about Webb's death that Sacramento County Coroner Robert Lyons issued a statement confirming Webb had died by suicide.[71] When asked by local reporters about the possibility of two gunshots being a suicide, Lyons replied: "It's unusual in a suicide case to have two shots, but it has been done in the past, and it is in fact a distinct possibility." News coverage noted that there were widespread rumors on the Internet at the time that Webb had been killed as retribution for his "Dark Alliance" series, published eight years before. 
Webb's ex-wife Susan Bell told reporters that she believed Webb had died by suicide.[1] "The way he was acting it would be hard for me to believe it was anything but suicide," she said. 
According to Bell, Webb had been unhappy for some time over his inability to get a job at another major newspaper. He had sold his house the week before his death because he was unable to afford the mortgage.[71] 
After Webb's death, a collection of his stories from before and after the "Dark Alliance" series was published. The collection, The Killing Game: Selected Stories from the Author of Dark Alliance, was edited by Webb's son, Eric. 
Deception is the act of propagating a belief that is not true, or is not the whole truth (as in half-truths or omission). Deception can involve dissimulation, propaganda, and sleight of hand, as well as distraction, camouflage, or concealment. 
There is also self-deception, as in bad faith. It can also be called, with varying subjective implications, beguilement, deceit, bluff, mystification, ruse, or subterfuge. 
Fazze is an influencer marketing agency. 
It is a subsidiary of AdNow, a Russian-based marketing firm. The agency was behind a multi-country campaign to spread COVID-19 disinformation online.[1][2][3] Fazze, a Russian marketing firm affiliate, maintained a network of 65 fake Facebook and 243 fake Instagram accounts as part of a disinformation campaign targeting Western-made vaccinations, according to a Facebook investigation.[4][5] 
The variable contained a 1024-bit public key; such keys are used in public-key cryptography for encryption and authentication. Because of the name, however, it was speculated that the key would allow the United States National Security Agency (NSA) to subvert any Windows user's security. Microsoft denied the speculation and said that the key's name came from the fact that NSA was the technical review authority for U.S. cryptography export controls. 
Microsoft claimed the third key was only in beta builds of Windows 2000 and that its purpose was for signing Cryptographic Service Providers.[5] 
It is in fact possible under certain circumstances to obtain an export license for software invoking cryptographic functions through an API. For example, Microsoft's implementation of the Microsoft Cryptographic API (CryptoAPI) specification was approved for export from the US, even though it implements an API by which third parties, including third parties outside the US, can add separate modules ("Cryptographic Service Providers" or CSPs) implementing cryptographic functionality. This export approval was presumably made possible because a) the CryptoAPI implementation requires third party CSPs to be digitally signed by Microsoft and rejects attempts to call CSPs not so signed; b) through this signing process Microsoft can ensure compliance with the relevant US export control regulations (e.g., they presumably would not sign a CSP developed outside the US that implements strong cryptography); and c) Microsoft's CryptoAPI implementation is available only in executable form, and thus is presumed to be reasonably resistant to user tampering to disable the CSP digital signature check.[7] 
Microsoft stated that the second key is present as a backup to guard against the possibility of losing the primary secret key. Fernandes doubts this explanation, pointing out that the generally accepted way to guard against loss of a secret key is secret splitting, which would divide the key into several different parts, which would then be distributed throughout senior management.[8] He stated that this would be far more robust than using two keys; if the second key is also lost, Microsoft would need to patch or upgrade every copy of Windows in the world, as well as every cryptographic module it had ever signed. 
It was possible to remove the second _NSAKEY.[1] 
There is good news among the bad, however. It turns out that there is a flaw in the way the "crypto_verify" function is implemented. 
Because of the way the crypto verification occurs, users can easily eliminate or replace the NSA key from the operating system without modifying any of Microsoft's original components. Since the NSA key is easily replaced, it means that non-US companies are free to install "strong" crypto services into Windows, without Microsoft's or the NSA's approval. Thus the NSA has effectively removed export control of "strong" crypto from Windows. 
In September 1999, an anonymous researcher reverse-engineered both the primary key and the _NSAKEY into PGP-compatible format and published them to key servers.[9] 
Microsoft requires all cryptography suites that interoperate with Microsoft Windows to have a digital signature. Since only Microsoft-approved cryptography suites can be shipped with Windows, it is possible to keep export copies of this operating system in compliance with the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which are enforced by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). 
During a presentation at the Computers, Freedom and Privacy 2000 (CFP2000) conference, Duncan Campbell, senior research fellow at the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), mentioned the _NSAKEY controversy as an example of an outstanding issue related to security and surveillance.[citation needed] 
In addition, Dr. Nicko van Someren found a third key in Windows 2000, which he doubted had a legitimate purpose, and declared that "It looks more fishy".[3] 
Microsoft denied the backdoor speculations on _NSAKEY and said "This speculation is ironic since Microsoft has consistently opposed the various key escrow proposals suggested by the government." According to Microsoft, the key's symbol was "_NSAKEY" because the NSA was the technical review authority for U.S. cryptography export controls, and the key ensured compliance with U.S. export laws.[4][2] 
National Economic Security and Recovery Act (NESARA) was a set of proposed economic reforms for the United States suggested during the 1990s by Harvey Francis Barnard. Barnard claimed that the proposals, which included replacing the income tax with a national sales tax, abolishing compound interest on secured loans, and returning to a bimetallic currency, would result in 0% inflation and a more stable economy. The proposals were never introduced before Congress. 
Barnard became aware of Goodwin's description of NESARA before his death in 2005. He denied that NESARA had been enacted into law or even assigned a tracking number, and condemned Goodwin's allegations as a disinformation campaign.[20] Goodwin, for her part, dismisses the NESARA Institute as a disinformation front for the Bush family.[citation needed] 
Critics consider NESARA to be a cult. 
Pointing to the fact that Goodwin, Lee, and Nidle frequently solicited donations from their readers, they accuse these leaders of being primarily interested in securing a steady stream of income for themselves.[21][22][23] Goodwin, who also asked readers to donate their frequent flyer miles,[24] claimed that she needed and had used the funds to travel to various locations around the world to secretly meet with high-level government officials about getting NESARA announced.[24][25] 
NESARA supporters often tell their readers that the NESARA announcement is going to happen in a matter of days. According to the documentary Waiting For NESARA, the claim was also made prior to March 2003 that George Bush was planning the war with Iraq only to further delay the NESARA announcement. It was prophesied that spiritual beings and UFOs would intervene with Bush's plans and prevent the war.[1] 
A June 2006 complaint to the Washington consumer protection division accused Goodwin of using the NESARA story to defraud a 64-year-old San Francisco woman of at least $10,000. The woman's daughter said the actual amount is much larger, in the hundreds of thousands.[1] 
NESARA has since become better known as the subject of a cult-like conspiracy theory promoted by Shaini Candace Goodwin, also known as "Dove of Oneness", who claimed that the act was actually passed with additional provisions as the National Economic Security and Reformation Act, and then suppressed by the George W. Bush administration and the Supreme Court. Goodwin's conspiracy emails have been translated into several languages and have a large following online.[1] 
Harvey Francis Barnard (1941–2005), a Louisiana State University graduate in systems philosophy, and an engineering consultant and teacher, created the NESARA proposal during the late 1980s and early 1990s.[2] He printed 1,000 copies of his proposal, titled Draining the Swamp: Monetary and Fiscal Policy Reform (1996), and sent copies to members of Congress, believing it would pass quickly on its merits. Based on a theory that debt is the number one economic factor inhibiting the growth of the economy, and compound interest the number one "moral evil" and reason for debt, Barnard made several other attempts during the 1990s to draw political attention to the problems he saw in the US economy, and his suggested economic recovery proposal based on the root causes he determined. After these did not succeed, he decided in 2000 to release the proposal to the public domain and publish it on the internet. 
Soon after Barnard released NESARA on the internet, a user known as "Dove of Oneness" began posting about it in internet forums. 
"Dove of Oneness" was later identified as Shaini Candace Goodwin, a former student of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment, referred to in the media as a "cybercult queen".[1] According to Goodwin's website, the NESARA bill languished in Congress before finally being passed by a secret session in March 2000 and signed by President Bill Clinton. It is claimed that the new law was to be implemented at 10 a.m. on September 11, 2001, but that the computers, and data (of the beneficiaries of the trillions of dollars of "Prosperity funds") were destroyed on the second floor of one of the World Trade Center towers in New York City during the terrorist attacks. 
Supposedly an earlier gag order issued by the Supreme Court had prohibited any official or private source from discussing it, under penalty of death.[1] Goodwin referred to "White Knights," most of them high-ranking military officials, who have since been struggling to have the law implemented despite opposition by President George W. Bush. Goodwin allegedly believes and purports that Bush orchestrated the September 11 attacks and the Iraq War as distractions from NESARA.[4][5] Goodwin's description of NESARA goes far beyond Barnard's proposal by cancelling all personal debts, abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, declaring world peace, and requiring new presidential and congressional elections. Goodwin often claimed that Bush officials were attempting to hack into and bring down her web site to prevent her from publicizing the law.[6] 
Goodwin began commenting on NESARA in connection with Omega Trust, a fraudulent investment scheme whose creator, Clyde Hood, was on trial at the time. According to Goodwin, Omega Trust investors would receive their returns after NESARA was announced.[1][7] Goodwin repeatedly predicted that the NESARA announcement would occur in the very near future,[8][9][10] although in later years she became more reserved in these predictions.[11] 
Neave transferred his territorial commission to the Royal Engineers on 2 May 1938[5] and following the outbreak of war he was mobilised. Sent to France in February 1940 with 1st Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery, he was wounded and captured by the Germans at Calais on 23 May 1940. He was imprisoned at Oflag IX-A/H near Spangenberg and in February 1941 moved to Stalag XX-A near Thorn in German-occupied western Poland. 
In April 1941 he escaped from Thorn with Norman Forbes. 
They were captured near Ilow while trying to enter Soviet-controlled Poland and were briefly in the hands of the Gestapo.[7] In May, they were both sent to Oflag IV-C (often referred to as Colditz Castle because of its location).[8] 
Neave made his first attempt to escape from Colditz on 28 August 1941 disguised as a German NCO. He did not get out of the castle as his hastily contrived German uniform (made from a Polish army tunic and cap painted with scenery paint) was rendered bright green under the prison searchlights.[9] Together with Dutch officer Anthony Luteyn he made a second attempt on 5 January 1942, again in disguise. 
Neave stood for the Conservative Party at the 1950 election in Thurrock and at Ealing North in 1951. He was elected for Abingdon in a by-election in June 1953, but his career was held back by a heart attack he suffered in 1959. 
He was a Governor of Imperial College between 1963 and 1971 and was a member of the House of Commons select committee on Science and Technology between 1965 and 1970. 
He was on the governing body of Abingdon School from 1953 to 1979.[24] 
Neave was author of the new and radical Conservative policy of abandoning devolution in Northern Ireland if there was no early progress in that regard, and concentrating on local government reform instead. This integrationist policy was hastily abandoned by Humphrey Atkins, who became Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the role Neave had shadowed. 
Campbell said that the agent was ready to give his name and the New Statesman was going to print the story. Benn, however, discounted the validity of the story, writing in his diary: "No one will believe for a moment that Airey Neave would have done such a thing."[25] The magazine printed the story on 20 February 1981, naming the agent as Lee Tracey. Tracey said he had met Neave, who asked him to join a team of intelligence and security specialists which would "make sure Benn was stopped". 
A planned second meeting never took place because Neave was killed.[26] 
During World War II he was the first British prisoner-of-war to succeed in escaping from Oflag IV-C at Colditz Castle, and later worked for MI9. After the war he served with the International Military Tribunal at the Nuremberg trials. He later became Conservative MP for Abingdon. 
Airey Neave was critically wounded on 30 March 1979 when a magnetic car bomb fitted with a tilt-switch exploded under his Vauxhall Cavalier[27] at 14:58 as he drove out of the Palace of Westminster car park.[28] He lost both legs in the explosion and died of his wounds at Westminster Hospital an hour after being rescued from the wrecked car. 
He was 63. 
The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) afterwards claimed responsibility for the assassination. Neave had been pressing within Conservative Party circles and in Parliament throughout the Troubles for the British Government to abandon its strategy of containment (including "Ulsterisation") of Irish republican paramilitarism within Northern Ireland, and switch to one of pursuing its military defeat. It is believed that this is what led to his being targeted.[29] 
Neave's death came two days after the vote of no confidence which brought down Callaghan's government and a few weeks before the general election, which brought about a Conservative victory and saw Thatcher come to power as Prime Minister. Neave's wife Diana, whom he married on 29 December 1942, was subsequently elevated to the House of Lords as Baroness Airey of Abingdon. 
Neave's biographer Paul Routledge met a member of the Irish Republican Socialist Party (the political wing of INLA) who was involved in the killing of Neave and who told Routledge that Neave "would have been very successful at that job [Northern Ireland Secretary]. He would have brought the armed struggle to its knees".[33] 
As a result of Neave's assassination the INLA was declared illegal across the whole of the United Kingdom on 2 July 1979.[34] 
Neave was assassinated in a car bomb attack at the House of Commons. The Irish National Liberation Army claimed responsibility. 
Neave was buried in the graveyard of St. Margaret's Church at Hinton Waldrist, in Oxfordshire.[35] 
Whilst working in the House of Commons as Paddy Ashdown's research assistant, Kevin Cahill claims to have had around six conversations with the security staff there. The most frequent remark was that "everyone knew" the story behind Neave's death but no one could talk about it in detail, because it would have been too dangerous. Cahill claims they did not believe INLA killed Neave. 
Instead, it was an "inside job". Cahill concluded that Neave was killed by MI6 agents working with the CIA because Neave sought to prosecute senior figures in the intelligence establishment for corruption.[36] 
Another person who did not accept the generally accepted version of events was Enoch Powell, the Ulster Unionist MP. Powell claimed in an interview with The Guardian on 9 January 1984 the Americans had killed Neave, along with Lord Mountbatten and Robert Bradford MP. He claimed the evidence came from a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary with whom he had a conversation.[37] 
On 18 October 1986, Powell returned to the subject of Neave's death in a speech to conservative students in Birmingham. 
He told them the INLA had not killed Neave, but rather, he had been assassinated by "MI6 and their friends". Powell said Neave's Northern Ireland policy had been one of integration with the rest of the UK and that the Americans feared that this process, if implemented by Neave, would have been irreversible. His killing, alleged Powell, was intended to make the British government adopt a policy more acceptable to America in her aim of a united Ireland within NATO.[38] 
In 2014, 35 years after Neave's death, it was reported that a fictionalised account of Neave's murder was to be used in a Channel 4 drama. The drama, Utopia, portrays Neave as a drinker who colluded with spies and portrays his assassination as perpetrated by MI5. This led to condemnation of the broadcaster, with Norman Tebbit (a friend and political colleague of Neave) saying "To attack a man like that who is dead and cannot defend himself is despicable".[39] 
Neave was the son of Sheffield Airey Neave CMG, OBE (1879–1961),[1] an entomologist, who lived at Ingatestone, Essex, and his wife Dorothy (d. 
1943), the daughter of Arthur Thomson Middleton. His father was the grandson of Sheffield Neave, the third son of Sir Thomas Neave, 2nd Baronet (see Neave baronets). 
The family came to prominence as merchants in the West Indies during the 18th century and were raised to the baronetage during the life of Richard Neave, Governor of the Bank of England. Neave spent his early years in Knightsbridge in London, before he moved to Beaconsfield. 
Neave was sent to St. Ronan's School, Worthing, and from there, in 1929, he went to Eton College. He went on to read Jurisprudence at Merton College, Oxford.[2]

Society by location. 
Cattle mutilation (also known as bovine excision[1] and unexplained livestock death[2]) is the killing and mutilation of cattle under unusual, usually bloodless, and anomalous circumstances. Worldwide, sheep, horses, goats, pigs, rabbits, cats, dogs, bison, deer and elk have been reported mutilated with similar bloodless excisions; often an ear, eyeball, jaw flesh, tongue, lymph nodes, genitals and rectum are removed. 
Many cases of mutilation have been reported worldwide since the 1967 Snippy incident, chiefly in the Americas and Australia. In South America, an estimated 3,500 incidents have occurred since 2002, when around 400 cases were reported.[13] Mutilation investigators assert that a large number of cases are never reported to authorities, perhaps no more than one in ten.[14] 
In the summer of 2019, five bulls were mutilated at the Silvies Valley Ranch in Oregon. It is estimated that each 2,000 pound bull was worth US$6,000. The FBI has made no comment on if there is an investigation or not on this particular event but the Silvies Valley Ranch offered a $25,000 reward for information on the topic.[15] 
In most cases, mutilation wounds appear to be clean and carried out surgically. Mutilated animals are sometimes, though not always,[16] reported to have been drained of blood and show no sign of blood in the immediate area or around their wounds. 
According to Howard Burgess, nearly 90 percent of mutilated cattle are between four and five years old.[17] 
The earliest known documented outbreak of unexplained livestock deaths occurred in early 1606 "...about the city of London and some of the shires adjoining. Whole slaughters of sheep have been made, in some places to number 100, in others less, where nothing is taken from the sheep but their tallow and some inward parts, the whole carcasses, and fleece remaining still behind. Of this sundry conjectures, but most agree that it tendeth towards some fireworks." 
The outbreak was noted in the official records of the Court of James I of England.[4] Charles Fort collected many accounts of cattle mutilations that occurred in England in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 
John Keel mentioned investigating animal mutilation cases in 1966 (while with Ivan T. Sanderson) that were being reported in the Upper Ohio River Valley, around Gallipolis, Ohio.[5] The phenomenon remained largely unknown outside cattle-raising communities until 1967, when the Pueblo Chieftain in Pueblo, Colorado, published a story about a horse named Lady near Alamosa, Colorado, that was mysteriously killed and mutilated. 
The story was republished by the wider press and distributed nationwide; this case was the first to feature speculation that extraterrestrial beings and unidentified flying objects were associated with mutilation.[6] 
In 1974, a few months after the first spate of alleged mutilations in the US, multiple farmers in Nebraska claimed to witness UFOs on the nights their cattle were harmed. One claimed he saw an object which "looked as if it had a little bluish-green light on each side with a glow surrounding it." The sightings were hailed by UFO researchers as the first physical evidence of extraterrestrial life.[45] 
At the same time that UFO reports were being filed with law enforcement, larger number of ranchers claimed to see black helicopters around their fields, coinciding with the cattle mutilations. Although some initially thought these were used by cattle rustlers, suspicion soon pointed toward a military operation running out of Fort Riley, Kansas. 
By 1975, the problem was so prevalent, that some ranchers formed armed vigilante groups to patrol their fields at night. 
Authorities ran ads in Colorado urging ranchers to not shoot at their survey helicopters.[46][2] 
Senator Floyd K. Haskell contacted the FBI asking for help in 1975 due to public concern regarding the issue. He claimed there had been 130 mutilations in Colorado alone, and further reports across nine states.[10] A 1979 FBI report indicated that, according to investigations by the New Mexico State Police, there had been an estimated 8,000 mutilations in Colorado, causing approximately $1,000,000 damage.[11] 
Local folklore has attributed the mutilations to chupacabras or similar creatures.[49] 
In May 2001, 200 goats were mutilated in Panggang District of Gunung Kidul Regency, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.[12]

Zethu Matebeni is a sociologist, activist, writer, documentary film maker, Professor and South Africa Research Chair in Sexualities, Genders and Queer Studies at the University of Fort Hare. She has held positions at the University of the Western Cape and has been senior researcher at the Institute for Humanities in Africa (HUMA) at UCT.[1] She has been a visiting Professor Yale University and has received a number of research fellowships including those from African Humanities Program, Ford Foundation, the Fogarty International Centre and the National Research Foundation.[2] 
Matebeni was born on May 1, 1978 in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. 
She studied Sociology at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University) and completed her Master of Arts in Sociology at the University of Pretoria [3] and an interdisciplinary Phd[4] completed at the Witwatersrand Institute for Social and Economic Research (WISER). Her published doctoral project is entitled Black Lesbian Sexualities and Identity in South Africa.[5] 
Zethu has been involved in LGBTQ activism since the early 1990s. Having been part of Uthingo Womyn's group (one of the few lesbian feminist collectives in South Africa) and later part of Free Gender, a black lesbian organisation in Khayelitsha Cape Town. 
Within the academic space she has been involved with the #RhodesMustFall movement at the University of Cape as well as one of the founding members of the Black Academic Caucus at the same institution. Her films and curated works including Jo'burg TRACKS: Sexuality in the City, and a book project Reclaiming Afrikan: queer perspectives on sexual and gender identities similarly engage with LGBT activism. Her first co-production Breaking Out of the Box: Stories of black lesbians (2011) has been shown both within South Africa and abroad. 
She has published on queer issues, sexuality, gender, race, HIV and AIDS, African film, cinema and photography. She is an active member of the Black Academic Caucus through which she published a few thought pieces, some of which are listed below. 
In 1975 the Norwegian trawler Rairo reported snagging her nets on an undersea obstruction in the area where the Gaul was lost. In 1977, however, the UK government decided against launching a search based on this (and other similar) information, despite being confident that this was indeed Gaul. It was argued that such an investigation would add little new information in aid of safety at sea to justify the cost.[13] 
In 1997 a TV crew, with help from Norwegian experts located the wreck exactly where Rairo had reported the snagging of her nets. 
She was discovered to be located some 70 nautical miles (130 km; 81 mi) off the northern coast of Norway and lying in 919 feet (280 m) of water.[14] 
On 17 December 2004 the RFI concluded that these open chutes, doors and hatches had compromised the ship's watertight integrity and, combined with a following (and as already noted) heavy sea led to flooding on the factory deck. The RFI also postulated that an attempted emergency manoeuvre by the Gaul's officer of the watch (a perfectly logical move to try to turn 'into the sea') caused 100 tonnes of floodwater to surge across to the starboard side of the ship leading to capsize and a catastrophic loss of stability. Further flooding then took place through open doors, chutes and hatches until the Gaul lost her reserves of buoyancy, she then sank very rapidly, stern first.[16] 
The report of the RFI dismissed the notion that Gaul was involved in espionage or that she was in a collision. It found that she was not fishing at the time of her loss, which indicated that no snagging (of the nets) could have occurred. 
The fishing vessel Gaul was a deep sea factory ship based at Hull, United Kingdom. She was built in 1972 by Brooke Marine of Lowestoft for the Ranger Fishing company and registered at North Shields as Ranger Castor, SN18 but renamed when Ranger Fishing was bought by British United Trawlers and re-registered at Hull as Gaul, H243.[2] She sank some time on the night of 8-9 February 1974 in storm conditions in the Barents Sea, north of Norway. No distress signal was received and her loss was not realised until 10 February after she twice failed to report in. 
An extensive search operation was launched but no trace of the ship was found, apart from a lifebuoy recovered three months later. All thirty-six crew were lost. The president of the British Trawler Federation described the loss of the Gaul as "the worst ever single-trawler tragedy".[3] 
In February 2014, a memorial service was held on St. Andrew's Quay, Hull, to mark the 40th anniversary of the loss of the Gaul.[18] 
Maurice Spurgeon joined the crew on the 28th at Tromsø and Gaul arrived at the fishing grounds off the north coast of Norway the following day. On 8 February the sea state became severe. Reports from the skippers of other trawlers in the area give the wave height at between 6.5 and 9m, wind between 7 and 10 on the Beaufort scale.[4] 
At 09:30 Gaul reported to British United Trawlers that she was "laid and dodging[5] off the North Cape Bank". At 10:30, as was company policy, she reported to the Orsino on the "Skipper's Freezer Schedule" - a summary of position, weather conditions, catch etcetera. A further report was due at 16:30 but Gaul, alone of the 17 British United Trawlers ships in the area at the time, failed to report.[6] 
The aircraft carrier HMS Hermes was in the area and was ordered to commence searching. The search involved four other British ships, three Norwegian ships and 19 trawlers, coordinated by the Hermes. No evidence of the missing Gaul was found and the search was called off on the afternoon of 15 February.[3][8][9] 
The original Formal Investigation in 1974 concluded that the most likely reason for her loss was that she was overwhelmed by a succession of very large waves in heavy seas and capsized.[10][11][12] The preliminary investigation had also found deficiencies in the maintenance of chutes, doors and hatches on Gaul's sister ship Kurd, but the relevance of this fact was downplayed at the formal inquiry. 
Fingering the vagina is often performed in an effort to stimulate an area which may be termed the G-spot. 
The G-spot is reportedly located roughly 5 cm (2.0 in) up on the anterior wall of the vagina, forwards toward the navel. It is described as being recognized by its ridges and slightly rougher texture compared to the more cushion-like vaginal cavity walls around it. Fingering this spot, and in effect possibly stimulating the Skene's gland, is commonly cited as a method that may lead to female ejaculation.[13] 
Some women have cited the "come hither" approach as a significant catalyst to orgasm. This technique involves the middle finger, sometimes additionally the index or ring finger, making a hand gesture like "come here" with the palm facing upwards towards her pubic bone. Medical professionals suggest washing the hands before contact with the vagina, to ensure proper hygiene, especially when moving between different orifices.[14] 
Anus 
Anal fingering may be pleasurable because of the large number of nerve endings in the anal area, and because of the added stimulation gained from stretching the anal sphincter muscles while inserting the finger. A good quality personal lubricant is advisable to both increase the pleasurable sensation and aid insertion. Some people prefer to simply stimulate the outer ring of the anus, while others will follow this by inserting one or more fingers. 
Anal fingering is also an effective way of stimulating the prostate in males, and thus may bring the receiver to orgasm.[15][16][17] 
How digital penetration without consent is classified legally depends on the jurisdiction. For example, penetration without consent of the vagina or anus with a finger is called "rape" in Australia[18] and "forcible rape" in the US.[19] In Scotland, the term "rape" is only used for penetration with a penis,[20] whereas penetration with a finger can be "sexual assault by penetration".[21] 
Fingering is typically the use of fingers or hands to sexually stimulate the vulva (including the clitoris), vagina, or anus.[1] [2] Vaginal fingering is legally and medically called digital penetration or digital penetration of the vagina. 
Fingering may be performed on oneself (masturbation) or by or with a sexual partner. When performed on the vulva or vagina by a sexual partner, it is a form of mutual masturbation, and is analogous to a handjob (the manual stimulation of the penis).[3][4] It may be used for sexual arousal or foreplay, constitute an entire sexual encounter,[4] or be used as a form of non-penetrative sexual activity.[5] 
Parts of the vulva, especially the clitoris, are erogenous zones.[6] Massage of the vulva, and in particular the clitoris, is the most common way for a woman to achieve an orgasm.[7][8][9] Studies indicate that 70-80% of women require direct clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm.[9][10] The clitoral glans or shaft may be massaged, usually through the skin of the clitoral hood, using up-and-down, side-to-side, or circular motions.[11] The rest of the genitals are also stimulated by fingering.[11] 
Vagina 
While the vagina is not especially sensitive as a whole, its lower third (the area close to the entrance) has concentrations of the nerve endings that can provide pleasurable sensations when stimulated during sexual activity.[1][2][12] 
Most male birds (e.g., roosters and turkeys) have a cloaca (also present on the female), but not a penis. 
Among bird species with a penis are paleognathes (tinamous and ratites)[3] and Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans).[4] A bird penis is different in structure from mammal penises, being an erectile expansion of the cloacal wall and being erected by lymph, not blood.[5] It is usually partially feathered and in some species features spines and brush-like filaments, and in flaccid state curls up inside the cloaca. The lake duck (also called Argentine blue-bill) has the largest penis in relation to body size of all vertebrates; while usually about half the body size (20 cm), a specimen with a penis 42.5 cm long is documented. 
The lake duck is notable for possessing, in relation to body length, the longest penis of all vertebrates; the penis, which is typically coiled up in flaccid state, can reach about the same length as the animal himself when fully erect, but is more commonly about half the bird's length.[7][8] It is theorized that the remarkable size of their spiny penises with bristled tips may have evolved in response to competitive pressure in these highly promiscuous birds, removing sperm from previous matings in the manner of a bottle brush. The lake duck has a corkscrew shaped penis.[9] 
As with any other bodily attribute, the length and girth of the penis can be highly variable between mammals of different species.[13][14] In many mammals, the size of a flaccid penis is smaller than its erect size. 
In mammals the penis is divided into three parts:[1] 
A penis (plural penises or penes /-niːz/) is the primary sexual organ that male animals use to inseminate females (or hermaphrodites) during copulation.[1][page needed] Such organs occur in many animals, both vertebrate and invertebrate, but males do not bear a penis in every animal species, and in those species in which the male does bear a so-called penis, the penises in the various species are not necessarily homologous. 
The term penis applies to many intromittent organs, but not to all. As an example, the intromittent organ of most cephalopoda is the hectocotylus, a specialized arm, and male spiders use their pedipalps. Even within the Vertebrata there are morphological variants with specific terminology, such as hemipenes. 
The human penis is an external sex organ of male humans. It is a reproductive, intromittent organ that additionally serves as the urinal duct. 
The main parts are the root of the penis (radix): It is the attached part, consisting of the bulb of penis in the middle and the crus of penis, one on either side of the bulb; the body of the penis (corpus); and the epithelium of the penis consists of the shaft skin, the foreskin, and the preputial mucosa on the inside of the foreskin and covering the glans penis. 
The human penis is made up of three columns of tissue: two corpora cavernosa lie next to each other on the dorsal side and one corpus spongiosum lies between them on the ventral side. The urethra, which is the last part of the urinary tract, traverses the corpus spongiosum, and its opening, known as the meatus /miːˈeɪtəs/, lies on the tip of the glans penis. 
It is a passage both for urine and for the ejaculation of semen. 
In males, the expulsion of urine from the body is done through the penis. The urethra drains the bladder through the prostate gland where it is joined by the ejaculatory duct, and then onward to the penis. 
PVC and jelly-rubber toys are problematic because they contain unsafe phthalates, softeners added to many plastics that are also found in some jewelry, food containers, and other soft rubber toys. Phthalates are linked to health problems such as cancer and prenatal defects. Products made of PVC or jelly rubber cannot be sterilized. 
Initially expensive, the cost of silicone dildos has dropped over time. Silicone is resistant to accidental damage, non-porous, and can be sterilized easily, making silicone dildos more durable and sanitary than dildos made of other soft materials. Silicone dildos conduct vibration well, and can be used in combination with a vibrator. 
A 5.5-inch (14 cm) clear jelly dildo 
A dildo is a sex toy, often explicitly phallic in appearance, intended for sexual penetration or other sexual activity during masturbation or with sex partners. Dildos can be made from a number of materials and shaped like an erect human penis. They are typically about the average length of an erect penis, 4–6 inches (10–15 cm), but some may be longer. 
A dildo's circumference is typically 4–5 inches (10–13 cm). 
An olisbos (pl. olisboi) is a classical term for a dildo, from Greek ὄλισβος,[15] i.e. a dildo that was usually made of leather.[citation needed] A godemiché is a dildo in the shape of a penis with scrotum.[citation needed] 
Dildos in one form or another have existed widely in history. 
Artifacts from the Upper Paleolithic of a type called bâton de commandement have been speculated to have been used for sexual purposes.[16] Few archaeologists consider these items as sex toys, but archaeologist Timothy Taylor put it, "Looking at the size, shape, and—some cases—explicit symbolism of the ice age batons, it seems disingenuous to avoid the most obvious and straightforward interpretation. 
But it has been avoided."[17][18] 
Dildos were not just used for sexual pleasure. Examples from the Eurasia Ice Age (40,000-10,000 BCE) and Roman era are speculated to have been used for defloration rituals. This is not the only example of dildos being used for ritual ceremonies, as people in 4000 BCE Pakistan used them to worship the god Shiva.[1] 
Many references to dildos exist in the historical and ethnographic literature. Haberlandt,[25] for example, illustrates single and double-ended wooden dildos from late 19th century Zanzibar. With the invention of modern materials, making dildos of different shapes, sizes, colors and textures became more practical.[26] 
Dildos may be seen in some examples of ancient Greek vase art. Some pieces show their use in group sex or in solitary female masturbation.[27] One vessel, of about the sixth century BCE, depicts a scene in which a woman bends over to perform oral sex on a man, while another man is about to thrust a dildo into her anus.[28] 
They are mentioned several times in Aristophanes' comedy of 411 BCE, Lysistrata. 
LYSISTRATA And so, girls, when fucking time comes… not the faintest whiff of it anywhere, right? 
From the time those Milesians betrayed us, we can't even find our eight-fingered leather dildos. 
At least they'd serve as a sort of flesh-replacement for our poor cunts… So, then! 
Would you like me to find some mechanism by which we could end this war?[29] 
METRO I beg you, don't lie, dear Corrioto: who was the man who stitched for you this bright red dildo?[30] 
This ballad was subsequently added to by other authors, and became so popular that Signor became a term for a dildo.[1] In the epilogue to The Mistaken Husband (1674), by John Dryden, an actress complains: 
To act with young boys is loving without men. 
What will not poor forsaken women try? 
When man's not near, the Signior must supply.[35] 
Some include penis-shaped items clearly designed for vaginal penetration, even if they are not true approximations of a penis. An anal dildo is intended for repeated anal penetration, to be distinguished from a butt plug which is flanged with the intent of remaining in place. People of all genders and sexual orientations use these devices for masturbation or other sexual activity. 
Rubber dildos, usually incorporating a steel spring for stiffness, became available in the 1940s. This arrangement was unsatisfactory because of the potential for injury from cuts by the spring if the rubber cracked and came apart. Later, PVC dildos with a softer PVC filler became popular.

Nguni people are a group of closely related Bantu ethnic groups that reside in Southern Africa. They predominantly live in South Africa. 
Swazi people live in both South Africa and Eswatini, while Ndebele people live in both South Africa and Zimbabwe. 
A group of the Nguni living in present day Malawi and Zambia and are known as the Ngoni. Both the Ndebele of Zimbabwe and the Ngoni migrated northwards out of South Africa in the early 19th century. 
Within the Nguni nations, the clan, based on male ancestry, formed the highest social unit.[citation needed] Each clan was led by a chieftain.[citation needed] Influential men tried to achieve independence by creating their own clan.[citation needed] The power of a chieftain often depended on how well he could hold his clan together.[citation needed] From about 1800, the rise of the Zulu clan of the Nguni, and the consequent Mfecane that accompanied the expansion of the Zulus under Shaka, helped to drive a process of an alliance between and consolidation among many of the smaller clans.[citation needed] 
In South Africa, the historic Nguni kingdoms of the Ndebele, Swazi, Xhosa and Zulu are in the present-day provinces of Eastern Cape, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and Mpumalanga. 
The most notable of these kingdoms are the Zulu Kingdom, which was ruled by Shaka, a powerful warrior king whose conquest took place in the early nineteenth century, and the Xhosa Kingdom, that was notorious not only for its victories in pre-colonial tribal wars but for the wars it fought against Britain and colonialists which lasted for 100 years. In Zimbabwe the Ndebele people live primarily in the provinces of Matabeleland .[2] 
Most of what is believed about ancient Nguni history comes from oral history and legends. 
Traditionally, their ancestors are said to have migrated to Africa's Great Lakes region from the North.[3] According to linguistic evidence—alone—and historians (including John H. Robertson, Rebecca Bradley, T Russel, Fabio Silva and James Steele) the ancestors of the Nguni people migrated from west of the geographic Centre of Africa[4] towards modern-day South Africa 7000 years ago (5000 BC).[5][6][7][8] Nguni people had migrated within South Africa to KwaZulu-Natal by the 1st century AD, and were also present in the Transvaal region at the same time.[9][10][11][12] Nguni people brought with them sheep, cattle, goats and horticultural crops, many of which had never been used in South Africa at that time.[13][10] 
Other provinces in present-day South Africa, such as Eastern Cape, saw the emergence of Nguni speakers at around the same time.[14] Some groups split off and settled along the way, while others kept going. 
Thus, the following settlement pattern formed: the southern Ndebele in the north, the Swazi in the northeast, the Xhosa in the south and Zulu towards the east. Owing to the fact that these people had a common origin, their languages and cultures show marked similarities. The ancestors of the Nguni eventually met and merged with San hunters, which accounts for their use of "click" in their languages.[15] 
The South African Ndebeles (Southern Ndebele people) were the first group to separate from other Nguni clans, after entering present-day South Africa and settling in the Transvaal region from around the year 1500. The remaining Nguni clans moved further south. Those that moved south-west ended up calling themselves Xhosas, and most of the clans that moved south-east ended up being forcibly united under the Zulus when Shaka (whose Zulus had been a minor clan under the Mthethwa confederacy led by Dingiswayo, Shaka's overlord) defeated the Ndwandwe confederacy under Zwide kaLanga. 
Before their defeat by Shaka Zulu they lived in the area north of the Umhlathuze River and south of the Pongola. After their defeat, they moved to the headwaters of the Nkomati river, among other areas (with one of Zwide's generals, Zwangendaba kaJele going as far as Malawi/Tanzania). Mzilikazi, chief of the Khumalo clan, became one of Shaka's top generals after the unification of the clans. 
Returning from a raid with his impi, he kept some of the stolen cattle for himself rather than handing them over to his overlord, Shaka, as was the custom. Such conduct was punishable by death. 
A regiment was sent to punish this general, which resulted in him fleeing with hundreds of his followers, eventually ending up in the Transvaal region where they came into contact with the (unrelated) Manala Ndebeles.[16] The Manala Ndebeles had been weakened by their separation from the Nzunza Ndebele after almost two to three centuries of their settlement in the Transvaal region. The separation led to the majority of the nation going with Nzunza and the minority with Manala. The Nzunza Ndebele moved north, and the Manala Ndebele, who were predominantly composed of women, remained in present-day Pretoria. 
When Mzilikazi arrived, he killed the Manala Ndebele king, King Silamba, and they settled there for a while before moving further north, ending up in present-day Zimbabwe around 1839. By the time they arrived in present-day Zimbabwe, Mzilikazi's Khumalo clan (which had been joined by other ethnic groups, such as the Sotho, Tswana and other displaced Ngunis in South Africa) was known as the Ndebele. Further conquests and assimilation of Zimbabwean groups (such as the Kalanga and Rozwi) meant that the original Khumalos from Zululand was eventually a minority in this large ethnic group, which was united by a common Nguni language, isiNdebele. 
Many tribes and clans are said to have been forcibly united under Shaka Zulu. Shaka Zulu's political organisation was efficient in integrating "conquered" tribes, partly by the age regiments, where men from different villages bonded with each other.[citation needed] 
"Dlamini" is a very common clan name among all documented Nguni languages (including Swati and Phuthi),[citation needed] associated with AbaMbo cultural identity.[clarification needed] 
Uhlsport GmbH is a German sporting goods manufacturer. 
Originally established in 1948 as "Haase & Uhl OHG" and later renamed "Karl Uhl GmbH", the company became "uhlsport GmbH" in 1994. It is an international company which has its permanent headquarters in Balingen in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. 
Uhlsport is the official equipment supplier to 1. 
FC Köln and 1. 
FC Magdeburg,[4] As official ball sponsor uhlsport supports the French Ligue 1 and the French Ligue 2.[5] The goalkeepers Alphonso Areola, Oliver Baumann, Odysseas Vlachodimos, Lukas Hradecky, Ron-Robert Zieler and others play with uhlsport gloves.[6] 
The company was founded in 1948 by Karl Uhl. Early production focussed on the manufacture of leather studs for football boots, and in 1953 uhlsport also began to produce football boot soles for sports shoe manufacturers.[1] In the years which followed more products were added, including shin guards, sports bandages, footballs and goalkeeper gloves, until finally uhlsport GmbH had developed a full range of football equipment. Since 2002, the company has been operating a multi-brand strategy for football and handball. 
The brand "uhlsport" specialises in football, especially goalkeeper equipment.[3] Since 2002, handball equipment has been marketed through the company's own "Kempa" brand. 
The German company operates an indirect distribution strategy with subsidiaries in France, Spain, and Sweden and with country managers in UK, Benelux, and Switzerland. Uhlsport has a further 80 distribution partners across the world. In 1998, the company was sold by the Uhl family to the Daiss family. 
LenovoEMC (formerly Iomega),[3][2][3] sometimes styled Lenovo | EMC², was a producer of external, portable, and networked storage products. Established in the 1980s in Roy, Utah, United States as Iomega, LenovoEMC sold more than 410 million digital storage drives and disks. 
It was formerly a public company.[6] The Zip drive was Iomega's most notable product.[7] In 2018, Lenovo discontinued the LenovoEMC product line.[8] 
On April 8, 2008, EMC Corporation announced plans to acquire Iomega for US$213 million.[13] The acquisition was completed in June 2008,[14] making Iomega the SOHO/SMB arm of EMC. EMC kept the Iomega brand name alive with products such as the StorCenter NAS line, ScreenPlay TV Link adapter, and v.Clone virtualization software.[3] 
Lenovo announced the construction of a research and development facility near São Paulo, Brazil, in November 2013. This facility would be dedicated to enterprise software and supporting LenovoEMC's development of high-end servers and cloud storage. 
Construction would cost $100 million and about 100 would be employed at the facility. It would be located in the University of Campinas Science and Technology Park, about 60 miles from São Paulo.[9] 
Iomega started business in Roy, Utah, U.S. in 1980 (the firm moved its headquarters to San Diego, California in 2001).[10] For many years, the firm was a significant name in the data storage industry. Iomega's most famous product, the Zip Drive, was revolutionary as it offered relatively large amounts of storage on easily portable compact cartridges. The original Zip disk's 100MB capacity was a huge improvement over the 1.44MB limitation of floppy disks. 
Without the revenue from its proprietary storage cartridges, Iomega's sales and profits declined considerably. Iomega's stock price, which was over $100 at its height in the 1990s, dipped to around $2 in the mid-2000s. Trying to find a niche for itself, Iomega released devices such as the HipZip MP3 player, the FotoShow Digital Image Center, and numerous external hard drives, optical drives, and NAS products. 
In 2012, reporter Vincent Verweij of Dutch broadcaster Katholieke Radio Omroep revealed that the contents of at least 16,000 Iomega NAS devices were publicly available on the internet. This was due to the devices being sold with password security disabled by default. 
Among those affected were KLM, ING Group, and Ballast Nedam, who all had confidential material leaked in this manner. Iomega USA acknowledged the problem and said future models (starting February 2013) would come with password security enabled by default. The company said it would clearly instruct users about the risks of unsecured data.[12] 
Olokun is an orisha in the religion of Santería. Olokun is an androgynous orisha, meaning Olokun is a man and a woman, depending on if it is the Olokun of Ifá or the Olokun of Ocha.[2][7] 
As Olokun did this to drown the humans, the orishas went to Orunmila to ask him what to do. Orunmila told them that Ogun needed to create the longest chain he could possibly create. It was ultimately Obatala who had the responsibility of imprisoning Olokun in her/his domain. 
Yoruba people Bini people 
Olokun is revered as the ruler of all bodies of water and for the authority over other water deities. Olokun is highly praised for their ability to give great wealth, health, and prosperity to their followers. Communities in both West Africa and the African diaspora view Olokun variously as female, male, or androgynous.[1][2][3] 
Water deities are "ubiquitous and vitally important in southern Nigeria";[4] Olókun worship is especially noted in the cities of the Edo people in southwest Nigeria. In West African areas directly adjacent to the coast, Olokun takes a male form among his worshipers while in the hinterland, Olokun is a female deity.[2] 
According to Yoruba traditions about their divine dynasty, Olokun - in her female incarnation - was the senior wife of Emperor Oduduwa. Her rivalry with one of his other wives is said to have led to her manifesting the Atlantic Ocean.[5] 
In May 2019, Mkhwebane's report into the Vrede Dairy Project was declared unconstitutional and set aside, with the Gauteng High Court finding that the Public Protector had failed in her duties to investigate the project.[34] The Public Protector's office was ordered to pay the costs of the challenge, with some of the costs awarded against Mkhwebane personally.[35] 
Mkhwebane was born in Bethal in Mpumalanga on 2 February 1970, matriculating from Mkhephula Secondary School in 1988. She graduated with a BProc followed by an LLB from the University of the North (now the University of Limpopo). Subsequently, she obtained a diploma in corporate law and a higher diploma in tax from the Rand Afrikaans University (now the University of Johannesburg).[2] In 2010 she completed a Masters in Business Leadership at the University of South Africa.[3] 
NXT has Arbitrary Messages which can be used to send encrypted or plain text as well as data (up to 1000 bytes of data permanently or 42 kilobytes of data for a limited amount of time). As a result, it can be used to build file-sharing services, decentralized applications, and higher-level NXT services. 
NXT allows the holders of the currency or NXT-Assets to vote in a cryptographically proven and externally verifiable way. This can be used for deciding on future development decisions or for shareholder voting, and It can also be applied to public elections and community-based decision making. 
NXT Plugins allow external developers to add features or usability enhancements. The plug-ins are not contained in a sandbox. 
NXT is an open source cryptocurrency and payment network launched in 2013 by anonymous software developer BCNext.[1] It uses proof-of-stake to reach consensus for transactions—as such there is a static money supply. 
Unlike Bitcoin, there is no mining.[2][3] NXT was specifically conceived as a flexible platform around build applications and financial services, and serves as basis for ARDR (Ardor), a blockchain-as-a-service multi-chain platform developed by Jelurida, and IoTeX (cryptocurrency)[4] the current steward of Nxt as of 2021.[5] NXT has been covered extensively in the "Call for Evidence" report by ESMA.[6] 
NXT was created with a total of one billion coins.[7] On 28 September 2013, Bitcointalk.org member BCNext created a forum thread announcing the proposed launch of NXT as a second generation cryptocurrency and asked for small bitcoin donations to determine how to distribute the initial stake. 
On 18 November 2013, fundraising for NXT was closed. 
The initial coin offering collected 21 bitcoins that were worth US$17,000.[8] 
In July 2016, NXT launched Smart Transaction templates, which were meant to serve as building blocks for businesses to construct Blockchain solutions for particular problems.[9] 
The core infrastructure of NXT is complex, which, compared to the leaner and simpler Bitcoin, creates more potential for flaws or mistakes.[10] However, this allows third parties to contribute to the blockchain with ease. 
NXT's Asset Exchange is a peer-to-peer exchange allowing decentralized trading of shares and crypto assets. Since the blockchain is an unalterable public ledger of transactions, it can provide a trading record for items other than NXT. To do this, NXT allows the designation or "coloring" of a particular coin, which builds a bridge from the virtual cryptocurrency world to the physical world. 
The WWE domains occur in two functional classes of proteins, namely those associated with ubiquitination and those associated with poly-ADP ribosylation (PARP). Hence, WWE domains hold an important function in signal transduction, protein degradation, DNA repair and apoptosis.[1] 
The WWE domain is named after three of its conserved residues, W and E residues (tryptophans and glutamate respectively), and is predicted to mediate specific protein-protein interactions in ubiquitin and ADP ribose conjugation systems (Poly ADP ribose polymerase). This domain is found as a tandem repeat at the N-terminal of Deltex, a cytosolic effector of Notch signalling thought to bind the N-terminal of the Notch receptor.[2] It is also found as an interaction module in protein ubiquination and ADP ribosylation proteins.[2] 
Within each WWE module, the residues form two similar structures vital to its stability. The two WWE modules interact and form a large cleft suitable for binding of extended polypeptides. The two WWE modules adopt compact structures mostly composed of beta strands, with a single three turn alpha helix in both modules and an additional short helical segment in the second WWE module. 
The two WWE modules hold a two-fold rotation axis.[1] 
Muho Asllani is a former Albanian politician of the Albanian Party of Labour (PPSh). He was a member of the Politburo, a representative in the Albanian Parliament for many years, First Secretary of Party in several districts, and member of the Cabinet of Albania during 1976-79. 
Asllani was born on 17 October 1937 in Bërdicë, near Shkodër, in a poor family.[1] After attending the agricultural technical school in Shkodër, he studied during 1961-1964 at the Agricultural Institute, now the Agricultural University of Tirana (Alb: Universiteti Bujqësor Tiranës). 
The 6th Congress of the PPSh in 1968 found him following the "V.Lenin" Party School in Tirana. In that congress, he became a member of the Central Committee of the Party, although he was not previously a candidate. The next year he served as Secretary of the Party in Shkodër, switching with Prokop Murra.[1]

The network has a bandwidth capacity of 5.5 Tbit/s with peak traffic about 2.5 Tbit/s and reports uptime of 99.9999%[5] 
In 1998, Leaseweb acquired its first servers and set up their first office in Utrecht. By 2005 the company owned 5,000 servers, a number that had doubled to 10,000 two years later. 
In 2007, Leaseweb relocated the company headquarters to the Amsterdam area.[citation needed] In 2010, Leaseweb acquires German hosting provider Netdirekt.[1] In 2016, Leaseweb acquires the Illinois based Nobis Technology Group, and its Ubiquity Hosting operations.[2] In 2018, Leaseweb USA acquires ServInt, a Northern Virginia-based web hosting and managed hosting services for cloud IT operations.[3] 
The company operates eighteen data centers in Europe, Asia and the United States. Leaseweb peers with Internet exchanges in Amsterdam, Stockholm, Warsaw, Budapest, Vienna, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Zurich, Brussels, Paris, Luxembourg, London, Madrid, Washington DC, New York, Miami, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Palo Alto, Seattle, San Jose, Hong Kong and Singapore. 
Early life

Prior to the events in Sharpville, Chiba was an activist in the Transvaal Indian Congress in the late 1950s and the South African Communist Party in 1960.[1][2] After the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, he concluded that peaceful protest had failed and military action was necessary, so he joined the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) in 1961.[3] 
He was a platoon commander in 1962 and a member of the group's High Command by 1963.[1] He was captured and tortured after a failed attempt to sabotage a railway line.[3] He and the rest of the group were sentenced as members of a banned organisation and sent to Robben Island.[3] Released in 1982, he continued the work of the ANC as a member of the United tic Front.[3] In 1983, he became one of the vice-presidents of the Transvaal Indian Congress.[2] He was rearrested in July 1985 and released without a trial in March 1986, after which he went into hiding so he could continue his work for the ANC.[2] 
Upon the ANC's legalization in 1990, he became the president of its Lenasia branch.[1] He was elected to South Africa's parliament in 1994 and 1999.[3] In 2004 he was named a member of the Order of Luthuli.[3] He was a board member of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation.[2] 
Chiba died on the 8 December 2017.[4] He is survived by wife Luxmi, three daughters - Gita, Kailash, and Yaswanti, seven grandchildren, and four great grandchildren.[2][4]

Oloibiri is a small community in Ogbia LGA located in Bayelsa State, in the eastern Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The inhabitants of Oloibiri community are mainly fishermen and farmers. This is the first place Oil was first discovered in Nigeria. 
Oloibiri is a historic town to the oil and gas industry in Nigeria. Nigeria's first commercial oil discovery in Oloibiri town by Shell Darcy on January 15, 1956. 
The discovery of oil in Oloibiri hasn't helped most Nigerians and only has led to destruction of the environment and the way of life of indigenous people of the Niger Delta.[citation needed] And with an initial production of 5,000 barrels of oil per day (which would later become as much as 2,000,000), Nigeria became the 6th largest oil producer on the chart of the Organisation of petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC. 
Oloibiri well was the first commercial oil well in Nigeria. Oloibiri Oilfield was the first commercial oil field in Nigeria as well as West Africa. 
Nigeria exported its first crude oil in February 1958 from the Oloibiri oil field. Nigeria's first crude oil export came from Oloibiri field in February 1958. Nigeria's first crude oil pipeline was laid from Oloibiri oil field to Port Harcourt on the Bonny River (Bonny Export Terminal). 
Inasmuch as Oloibiri town was the 'birthplace' of oil in Nigeria, it is a sight for sore eyes.[clarification needed][1] The place is under-developed, the people are poor peasants, the epidemic rate is off the charts,[clarification needed][2] the unemployment rate is alarming,[clarification needed][3] and their land has suffered deadly blows from oil spills. 
The oil in Oloibiri has since dried up but there is nothing to show that it was the place where Nigeria's oil breakthrough started. In plain terms, it could be said that the town of Oloibiri was used and 'dumped' after the oil explorers found no more use for it. The Federal Government of Nigeria once promised to build a museum in Oloibiri, but till date, that promise has not been fulfilled.

Halata & Spathe (1997) reported; "the glans penis contains a predominance of free nerve endings, numerous genital end bulbs and rarely Pacinian and Ruffinian corpuscles. 
Merkel nerve endings and Meissner's corpuscles are not present."[11] 
Yang & Bradley argue; "the distinct pattern of innervation of the glans emphasizes the role of the glans as a sensory structure".[1] Some researchers have suggested that the glans has evolved to become acorn, mushroom or cone shaped so that during copulation it acts to remove any semen still there from previous sex partners, but this is not supported when looking at primate relatives who have different mating behaviors.[12][13] 
The epithelium of the glans penis is mucocutaneous tissue. Birley et al. report that excessive washing with soap may dry the mucous membrane which covers the glans penis and cause non-specific dermatitis.[citation needed] 
Edwards reported that it is generally more common in males who have poor hygiene habits or have not been circumcised. It has many causes, including irritation, or infection with a wide variety of pathogens. Careful identification of the cause with the aid of patient history, physical examination, swabs and cultures, and biopsy are essential in order to determine the proper treatment.[citation needed] 
Meatal stenosis is a late complication of circumcision, which occurs in about 2 to 20 percent of circumcised boys.[14][15] 
Male felids are able to urinate backwards by curving the tip of the glans penis backward.[16][17] In cats, the glans penis is covered with spines, but in dogs, the glans is smooth. Penile spines also occur on the glans of male and female spotted hyenas.[16] 
In male dogs, the glans penis consists of two parts called the bulbus glandis and pars longa glandis.[18] The glans of a fossa's penis extends about halfway down the shaft and is spiny except at the tip. 
In comparison, the glans of felids is short and spiny, while that of viverrids is smooth and long.[19] The shape of the glans varies among different marsupial species.[20][21][22] In most marsupials, the glans is divided, but male macropods have an undivided glans penis.[23] The glans penis is also divided into two parts in platypuses and echidnas.[24][25] 
In Thomasomys ucucha the glans penis is rounded, short, and small and is superficially divided into left and right halves by a trough at the top and a ridge at the bottom. Most of the glans is covered with spines, except for an area near the tip.[28] 
When erect, the glans of a horse's penis increases by 3 to 4 times. The urethra opens within the urethral fossa, a small pouch at the distal end of the glans.[30] Unlike the human glans, the glans of a horse's penis extends backwards on its shaft.[31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39] 
Clitoris Corona of glans penis Corpus cavernosum penis Foreskin Frenulum of prepuce of penis Hirsuties papillaris genitalis 
The glans penis, commonly referred to as the glans, is a structure at the distal end of the penis in male mammals. It is the sensitive bulbous structure at the end of the human penis, and is anatomically homologous to the clitoral glans of the human female. The glans penis may be smooth, spiny, elongated, or divided in other mammals. 
Typically, the glans is completely or partially covered by the foreskin in humans, except in those who have been circumcised. The foreskin can generally be retracted over and past the glans, and may automatically retract during an erection. The glans is more commonly known as the "head" or the "tip" of the penis. 
In humans 
It is moulded on the rounded ends of the corpora cavernosa penis, extending farther on their upper than on their lower surfaces. At the summit of the glans is the slit-like vertical external urethral orifice. The circumference of the base of the glans forms a rounded projecting border, the corona glandis, overhanging a deep retroglandular sulcus (the coronal sulcus), behind which is the neck of the penis. 
The proportional size of the glans penis can vary greatly. On some penises it is much wider in circumference than the shaft, giving the penis a mushroom-like appearance, and on others it is narrower and more akin to a probe in shape.[citation needed] The soft cushiony texture of the glans absorbs impact during rigorous instances of copulation.[2] 
The foreskin maintains the mucosa in a moist environment.[3] Circumcised penises have a glans which is permanently exposed and dry. 
Several studies have suggested the glans is equally sensitive in both circumcised and uncircumcised penises,[4][5][6] while others have reported it is more sensitive in people who are not circumcised.[7][8] 
John Taylor (1 November 1808 – 25 July 1887) was an English-born religious leader who served as the third president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1880 to 1887. He is the first and so far only president of the LDS Church to have been born outside the United States. 
Taylor is reported to have had a marvelous singing voice. At the request of Hyrum Smith, he twice sang the song "A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief" in Carthage Jail just before the Smith brothers' murder.[13] 
Taylor wrote the lyrics to several hymns, some of which are still used by the LDS Church. In 2005, Taylor's hymn "Joseph the Seer" was sung at the LDS Church's celebration of the 200th anniversary of Joseph Smith's birth. The 1985 English-language edition of the LDS Church hymnal includes two hymns with lyrics by Taylor, "Go Ye Messengers of Glory" (no. 
262) and "Go, Ye Messengers of Heaven" (no. 
Following Brigham Young's death in 1877, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles governed the church, with John Taylor as the quorum's president. Taylor became the third president of the church in 1880. He chose as his counselors Joseph F. Smith and George Q. Cannon, the latter being the nephew of his wife, Leonora. 
The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, with Wilford Woodruff as president of the quorum, assumed leadership during this interim period. In the April 1889 church general conference, the First Presidency was reorganized with Wilford Woodruff as the president. Six months later, in the October general conference, Anthon H. Lund was called to fill Woodruff's vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. 
Taylor was born in Milnthorpe, Westmorland (now part of Cumbria), England, the son of James and Agnes Taylor. He had formal schooling up to age fourteen, and then he served an initial apprenticeship to a cooper and later received training as a woodturner and cabinetmaker. He claimed that as a young man, he had a vision of "an angel in the heavens, holding a trumpet to his mouth, sounding a message to the nations"—which he would later identify as the angel Moroni.[3] He was christened in the Church of England, but joined the Methodist church at sixteen. 
Taylor's parents and siblings emigrated to Upper Canada (present-day Ontario) in 1830. Taylor stayed in England to dispose of the family property and joined his family in Toronto in 1832. He met Leonora Cannon from the Isle of Man while attending a Toronto Methodist Church and, although she initially rejected his proposal, married her on 28 January 1833. 
Taylor's teachings as an apostle were the 2003 course of study in the LDS Church's Sunday Relief Society and Melchizedek priesthood classes. 
Between 1834 and 1836, John and Leonora Taylor participated in a religious study group in Toronto. The group discussed problems and concerns with their Methodist faith, and quickly became known as the "Dissenters." Other members included Joseph Fielding and his sisters Mary and Mercy, who later also became prominent in the Latter Day Saint movement. 
Taylor and his wife first came in contact with the Church of the Latter Day Saints in 1836 after meeting Parley P. Pratt, an apostle in the church, in Toronto. 
Leonora was the first to join the church and she persuaded Taylor to continue his studies with Pratt. 
After the couple's baptism into the church, they were active in preaching and the organization of the church in Upper Canada. Taylor for a time presided over six branches in the Toronto area. 
In July 1837 he was closely involved in coordinating Joseph Smith's visit to the Toronto area.[4] They then moved to Far West, Missouri, where Taylor was ordained an apostle on 19 December 1838. He assisted other church members as they fled frequent conflicts to Commerce, Illinois (soon after renamed Nauvoo). 
Thomas Sankara was born Thomas Isidore Noël Sankara[23] on 21 December 1949 in Yako, French Upper Volta as the third of ten children to Joseph and Marguerite Sankara. His father, Joseph Sankara, a gendarme,[24][25] was of mixed Mossi–Fulani (Silmi–Moaga) heritage while his mother, Marguerite Kinda, was of direct Mossi descent.[26] He spent his early years in Gaoua, a town in the humid southwest to which his father was transferred as an auxiliary gendarme. 
As the son of one of the few African functionaries then employed by the colonial state, he enjoyed a relatively privileged position. 
The family lived in a brick house with the families of other gendarmes at the top of a hill overlooking the rest of Gaoua.[23] 
Sankara attended primary school at Bobo-Dioulasso. 
He applied himself seriously to his schoolwork and excelled in mathematics and French. 
He went to church often, and impressed with his energy and eagerness to learn, some of the priests encouraged Thomas to go on to seminary school once he finished primary school. 
Despite initially agreeing, he took the exam required for entry to the sixth grade in the secular educational system and passed. 
Thomas's decision to continue his education at the nearest lycée Ouezzin Coulibaly (named after a preindependence nationalist) proved to be a turning point. 
This step got him out of his father's household since the lycée was in Bobo-Dioulasso, the country's commercial centre. 
At the lycée, Sankara made close friends, including Fidèle Too, whom he later named a minister in his government; and Soumane Touré, who was in a more advanced class.[1] 
His Roman Catholic parents wanted him to become a priest, but he chose to enter the military. 
The military was popular at the time, having just ousted a despised president. 
It was also seen by young intellectuals as a national institution that might potentially help to discipline the inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy, counterbalance the inordinate influence of traditional chiefs and generally help modernize the country. 
Besides, acceptance into the military academy would come with a scholarship; Sankara could not easily afford the costs of further education otherwise. 
He took the entrance exam and passed.[1][27] 
Moreover, he outlawed female genital mutilation, forced marriages and polygamy.[17] He appointed women to high governmental positions and encouraged them to work outside the home and stay in school, even if pregnant.[2][3] Sankara encouraged the prosecution of officials accused of corruption, counter-revolutionaries and "lazy workers" in Popular Revolutionary Tribunals.[15] As an admirer of the Cuban Revolution, Sankara set up Cuban-style Committees for the Defense of the Revolution.[4] Such programs led to criticism by Amnesty International and other non-governmental organizations for violations of human rights, who alleged that there were extrajudicial executions and arbitrary detentions of political opponents.[19] 
His revolutionary programmes for African self-reliance made him an icon to many of Africa's poor.[18] Sankara remained popular with most of his country's citizens.[20][21] However, his policies alienated and antagonised several groups, which included the small but powerful Burkinabé middle class, the tribal leaders who were stripped of their long-held traditional privileges of forced labour and tribute payments, and the governments of France and its ally the Ivory Coast.[4][22] Opposition parties and unions were banned and media freedoms curtailed. 
Striking teachers were fired and replaced by young people with no experience.[6] On 15 October 1987, Sankara was assassinated by troops led by Blaise Compaoré, who assumed leadership of the state shortly after having Sankara killed. 
Early life 
Thomas Isidore Noël Sankara (French pronunciation: ​[tɔma sɑ̃kaʁa]; 21 December 1949 – 15 October 1987) was a Burkinabé military officer and socialist revolutionary who served as the President of Burkina Faso from his coup in 1983 to his deposition and killing in 1987. 
A Marxist–Leninist and pan-Africanist, he was viewed by supporters as a charismatic and iconic figure of revolution and is sometimes referred to as "Africa's Che Guevara".[1][2][3][4] 
After being appointed Prime Minister in 1983, disputes with the sitting government led to Sankara's eventual imprisonment. 
While he was under house arrest, a group of revolutionaries seized power on his behalf in a popularly-supported coup later that year.[1][6] 
Aged 33, Sankara became the President of the Republic of Upper Volta. 
He immediately launched programmes for social, ecological and economic change and renamed the country from the French colonial name Upper Volta to Burkina Faso ("Land of Incorruptible People"), with its people being called Burkinabé ("upright people").[7][8] His foreign policies were centred on anti-imperialism, while he rejected aid from organizations such as the International Monetary Fund. 
Sankara welcomed foreign aid from other sources but tried to reduce reliance on aid by boosting domestic revenues and diversifying the sources of assistance.[3] 
His domestic policies were focused on preventing famine with agrarian self-sufficiency and land reform, prioritising education with a nationwide literacy campaign and promoting public health by vaccinating more than 2 million children against meningitis, yellow fever and measles. 
Between 18,000 and 50,000 children who died annually of measles and meningitis lived.[10][11][12] Burkinabe built for the first time scores of schools, health centers, water reservoirs, and nearly 100 km of rail, with little or no external assistance. 
Total cereal production rose by 75% between 1983 and 1986.[4][5] 
Other components of his national agenda included planting over 10 million trees to combat the growing desertification of the Sahel, redistributing land from private landowners, suspending rural poll taxes and domestic rents and establishing a road and railway construction programme.[14][2][15] On the local level, Sankara called on every village to build a medical dispensary and had pharmacies built in 5,384 out of 7,500 villages.[16] From 1982 to 1984 the infant mortality rate dropped from 208 per 1,000 births to 145.[16] School attendance under Sankara increased from 6% to 22%.[15] 
Jethro Mohlala, commonly known as Lovers Mohlala, (born 26 April 1975) is a South African former footballer who played professionally as a left-fullback in Greece and South Africa. He earned nine caps for the South African national team, and was named to the squad for the 2002 COSAFA Cup.[4] 
Born in Alexandra, Mohlala turned professional with Wits University in 1992. After five seasons with Wits, he joined Mamelodi Sundowns.[5] Following a failed move to F.C. Copenhagen, Mohlala forced a move to AmaZulu. Shortly after, he re-signed with Wits, before moving to Jomo Cosmos.[6] 
In January 2004, Mohlala signed with Superleague Greece side Aris Thessaloniki, but he made just two league appearances for the club before returning to South Africa six months later.[7] He would play for Jomo Cosmos, Silver Stars, Moroka Swallows, AmaZulu and Black Leopards before retiring in 2009.[2] 
Mohlala represented South Africa at all age levels. He made his senior debut in a 1999 COSAFA Cup match against Botswana.[8] 
Mathibe Rebecca Mohlala is a South African politician. She was elected as a Member of Parliament in the National Assembly for the Economic Freedom Fighters party in 2019.[2][3] 
Since becoming an MP, she has served on the Standing Committee on Finance.[4] 
General Siphiwe Nyanda SSA, SBS, CLS, DMG, MMS, MMM (born 1950)[1] is a former South African military commander and politician. He served as Chief of the South African National Defence Force from 1998 to 2005, Minister of Communications from 2009 to 2010 and appointment as a board member of Denel in May 2018. 
At the same time as the allegations surrounding his living arrangements came to light, Nyanda's private business was under scrutiny. 
A company, in which Nyanada's family owned 45%, called GNS Risk Management Services (subsequently renamed Abalozi Security Risk Advisory Services) was accused of impropriety in a tender process in March 2010. Amongst its numerous clients were several parastatals, including Transnet Freight Rail, passenger train company Metrorail, state bus company Autopax, and the Gauteng provincial government.[5] 
It later emerged that Transnet Freight Rail had been involved in the awarding of tenders without following the correct procedures. Amongst the tenders that were questioned was one security contract valued at ZAR 55 million, awarded to GNS Risk Management Services.[6] Transnet's CEO, Siyabonga Gama, was dismissed when the allegations came to light. 
However, Nyanda was not reprimanded.[7] 
In October 2010, Nyanda came under fire for the suspension of communications director general Mamodupi Mohlala. It was reported that in July 2010, on the day that Nyanda axed Mohlala, she had reported tender irregularities worth ZAR 70 million to the police for a fraud investigation and had reportedly called for disciplinary action against several senior civil servants.[8] 
Nyanda fervently denied the allegations, labeling them "false, spurious and malicious".[9] However, shortly after the story regarding the removal of Mohlala came out, Nyanda was removed from his position as Minister of Communications.[10] Despite the numerous suggestions of political impropriety, Nyanda was subsequently appointed as a parliamentary counselor to ex-President Jacob Zuma.[11][when?] 
Nyanda joined Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the military wing of the African National Congress, in 1974, and served as a field commander during the liberation struggle against the South African government in the 1980s. He was appointed MK Chief of Staff in 1992, and served on the Transitional Executive Council which oversaw the change of government in 1994. 
In 1999, Nyanda was awarded the Star of South Africa, Gold.[3] 
Nyanda was a controversial figure throughout the 18 months that he was minister of communications. 
Dubbed the "minister of luxury" by South Africa's Mail & Guardian, Nyanda was alleged to have spent hundreds of thousands of rands living in a luxurious Cape Town hotel throughout his tenure because he was unhappy with the ministerial house allocated to him.[4] 
During the sacrifices traditional beer is made and an animal (goat/chicken/cow) has to be a slaughtered. Some blood of the slaughtered animal together with some beer is poured on the legandelo (sacrificial platform) as offering to the spirits. The senior most member of the clan present at the sacrifice calls out the names of the ancestors according to hierarchy accompanied by the clapping of hands of the other members of the clan. 
Traditional medicine has been and still is a specialty of Mapulana. This could be attributed to the rich sub tropical climate of Mapulaneng making herbs to grow in abundance. Traditional medicine is dispensed by Dingaka (traditional doctors). 
To become a traditional doctor one has to undergo rigorous and lengthy training under a Gobela (Guru). A traditional doctor-in-training is called a letwasane (Sangoma). Rainmaking was also Mapulana's specialty. 
The practices of initiation schools are marked by secrecy. Boys who have undergone initiation together will belong to the same mphato/moroto (regiment). An elaborate system is in place to distinguish a regiment from another based on when the regiment was initiated. 
The uninitiated cannot "visit" an initiation school when it is in session. 
The names of Mephato ya badika are Matuba, Mangana, Magakwa, Madingwane, Mankwe, Maakwa, .Madisha, Makgola, Madikwa, Manala, Magolopo. As can be expected women do not have regiments. 
There are those who come from Kgorong e kgolo (higher clan) or Kgorong ea nyana (lower clan). Those from Kgorong e kgolo are of royal blood or are born from the senior wife and are expected to be dikata-pele (leaders) during initiation ceremonies. This system is also used in the go loma maraka (festival of first harvest) and during the planting season. 
Both Mashego and Malele are chiefs in the Bushbuckridge area, Chilwane is the chief in the Acornhoek and Pilgrem's Rest area and Mogane and Nonyane in the Graskop and Sabie area and bagaMashile in the Matibidi to Lydenburg areas. Mapulana have two senior chiefs bagaChiloane and Mashego Masoyi. Legendary chief of a section of Mapulana is buried in Mmadiokane (Manaledi )Village in Botswana after relocating from Mmalebogo with his clan of Ba ga Mogoma of his uncle Kgosi Disikalala. 
A boy's family used to identify a family from which a boy was supposed to marry. The boy then wooed the girl who meets his fancy in that chosen family. In some cases the boy identified his own girl. 
For all purposes, the marriage was arranged as the families gave their blessings behind the scenes. The boy's family negotiated on dikgomo tsa bogadi which had to be paid to the girl's family. Polygamy was practiced. 
The Pulana or Mapulana, are a low-veld Sotho-Tswana ethnic group found in the northeastern part of the Mpumalanga and southeastern Limpopo provinces. Their language is called Sepulana (SeKutswe and Pai) and is considered dialect of the Northern Sotho language group. 
When children are born "ba ya relela" (they get the name of their ancestor). When somebody's name is Thadishe, for instance, he may well be Thadishe the 6th. The paternal grandmothers and aunts know which name to grant a child. 
This was usually done after consulting with the Ngaka who will tell them who is being reincarnated by the child's birth. When a baby is sleepless or sickly, he/she is pointed to the moon by his grandmother or aunt. The grandmother will chant out: "mogwera wa go ke yela, gola o reme diphate, o tshware lerumo or lwe dintwa!" 
(There is your friend/ Your friend is the moon, grow and cut trees (for wood), grow, pick up the spears and fight wars!). In essence, grow and be strong. 
Leruo (livestock) and Mashemo (land under cultivation) used to distinguish a rich man from a poor man. Land belonged to all the residents of an area and the Chief allocated the cultivation space. Grazing land was communal. 
The calendar of Mapulana works in lunar months, with the dawning of the full moon being the first day of the month. In SePulane the word kgwedi (moon) also means month. The shape and brightness of the moon can be read to determine when rains are going to fall. 
Planting used to be done according to the family's seniority, dikgoro tse kgolo starting first and others junior clans follow. Mabele (maize and millet) get planted first, Dintlu (jugobeans) last. Other crops like Mjumbula (cassava), Mathape (colocasia), Matlapala etc. being planted at any time of the year. 
When plants are ready for harvesting, the elder of a clan will pick a small selection of the harvest. He or she will call out the names of the ancestors and dedicate the harvest to them. Every member of that clan will be made to nibble from the small pickings. 
The name MaPulana refers to a common ancestor named Lepulana, his name referring to legendary accounts of his rainmaking abilities. Lepulana was also known as Chiloane. 
The area where the Pulana live is called Mapulaneng, it stretches from Crocodile River in the south to the Swazi border (Mapulana of Mashego ) from Crocodile to Olifants River in the north, Lebombo Mountains in the east and also includes the whole town of Hazyview, Lepunama (Nelspruit), Sabie, Graskop, Hoedspruit, Barberton, Lydenburg and Dullstroom in the west. In the Pulana language or Sepulana, Mapulaneng means "Place of the Mapulana people"; the tribe derive their name from their founding leader, Lepulana who later changed his name to Chiloane. 
Mapulana are descendants of Morolong and their origin can be traced back to the Kgalagadi before they settled in Thaba Chueu, in what is today eastern Lesotho and Shakwaneng (Carolina) in the 1500s. Mapulana of Matshwe I got their name from their leader Pulane and they are offshoots of Amazizi and they are of Nguni origin. 
The totem symbol of the MaPulana is the lion. 
Most MaPulana live in the area from Hoedspruit to Hazyview and their surrounds. This greater area is often referred to as "Mapulaneng" which means "Place of the people of Pulana (Lepulana)". Their ancestral lands historically, however stretched from Klaserie (north of Hoedspruit in the north to as far south as Mbombela (Nelspruit) including present day Graskop, Sabie and Ohrigstad. 
There are also a significant number of MaPulana living in Mabopane, Winterveld and Klipgat north west of Pretoria as well as in Daveyton east of Johannesburg where there is a street named after the MaPulana. Other Villages of Mapulana include [[Chochocho]Lilydale, Cottondale, Dwarsloop, Mariti, Mgandusweni, Manyeleti, Lephong, Moloro, Matibidi, Leroro, Greenvalley, GaJosefa, Jerusalema, Oakley, Rolle, Wales,[1]] 
David Nyathi – Soccer player.

The origin of the MaPulana and the history of how long they have been living in the greater Mapulaneng area is a topic of hot debate. Research shows that there are three groups of Mapulana, Mapulana of Mohlomi who are Bakwena and the first Mapulana to settle at Thaba Chueu, Mapulana of Matshwe I, of Pulane who are Amazizi and used to live along the Tugela River and later joined the other Mapulana at Thaba Chueu. The Mapulana of Chiloane who are Barolong by origin and left the main Barolong tribe during the reign of Tau. 
A bitter quarrel erupted between the two brothers over a young woman who happened to be their cousin and the conflict was concealed by the royal family and told the people that the brothers fought over a grain barn (seshego sa mabele) After realising that the people were supporting the elder brother, Mashego left with his followers and settled along some Bakwena in what is present day Swaziland and detached himself from the main Mapulana tribe. Chiloane and Mashego were both recognized as Mapulana kings with Chiloane being the senior. The Mapulana of Chiloane used to live in Phageng (Empakeni) south east of Nelspruit and along the Lepunama River (Nelspruit) while Mapulana of Mashego lived at Motsheteng (Emjindini, Barberton where Masoyi II grandson of Mashego was buried) MaPulana historian Moses Mashego tells us "They had two kings, Mashego and Chiloane, the rest were subjects and chiefs." 
In December 1864, the MaPulana defeated the Swazis at the battle of Moholoholo under the leadership of four chiefs, Maripe Mashile, Chiloane and Mohlala, with Sekakole Maatjie who was a brave warrior and a magician. The BaPedi under King Sekhukhune refused to help and the Mapulana defended their stronghold of Moholoholo mountains against a Swazi invasion sent by King Mswati II. The Swazi's were annihilated and the first to meet their death at the top of the mountain was the Swazi king's younger brother Zimase. 
There are legendary tales among the MaPulana about the bravery and cleverness of Sekakole (who was already and old man) at the Battle of Moholoholo. It is said that he wielded guns that he had traded for, and performed many magic spells to best the Swazi soldiers with one notable tale telling of how he turned himself into an anthill to confuse his enemy and escape. 
Xolisile Shinars Qayiso (born 8 February 1962) is a South African politician and a member of the National Assembly of South Africa. He is a member of the African National Congress. 
Qayiso was born on February 8, 1962. 
He started school at Byelkanderkoms Primary School in Bloemfontein West in 1972 and matriculated from Moemedi High School in 1984.[1] After a year of training and receiving a certificate, he was employed as an enrolled nursing assistant. 
He then did some short courses at the University of South Africa and earned a certificate in knowledge management.[1] Qayiso is currently fulfilling a course on Basic Principle of Labour Law at the University of the Free State.[1] 
As a trade unionist, Qayiso was a member of National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union and a shop steward.[1] He was the provincial treasurer of NEHAWU at one stage. 
He also served as the provincial chairperson and deputy provincial chairperson of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) in the Free State.[1] 
Qayiso was also a branch office bearer and worked as a regional paralegal coordinator. He was a member of the Mangaung Advice Centre in the early 1990s.[1] 
Qayiso joined the African National Congress in 1992 and later the South African Communist Party. He was a branch executive member tasked with political education.[1] He is currently a member of the provincial executive committee of the ANC.[1] 
Qayiso stood as an ANC parliamentary candidate from the Free State in the 2019 national elections,[2] and was subsequently elected to the National Assembly and sworn in on 22 May 2019.[3][4] 
Kathleen Dibolelo Mahlatsi (born 12 June 1984) is a South African politician and a Member of the National Assembly of South Africa from the Free State. Mahlatsi is a member of the African National Congress. 
In April 2021, Mahlatsi criticised the United Democratic Movement leader, Bantu Holomisa's call for the dissolution of the national government and the appointment of an interim one until the next general elections in 2024, calling it misinformed, misguided and opportunistic.[10] 
Mahlatsi was born on 12 June 1984 in Bloemfontein. She attended Brebner High School before going on to study at the Central University of Technology and the University of the Free State. Before she was elected to parliament in 2019, Mahlatsi worked for the Free State Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport and the Free State Department of Social Development. 
In December 2018, she was elected as the second deputy national secretary of the Young Communist League of South Africa.[2] 
In 2019, Mahlatsi stood for election to the South African National Assembly as 5th on the ANC's list of Free State National Assembly candidates.[3] The ANC dominated in the Free State, winning 8 out of the 11 list seats.[4] Mahlatsi was elected in the election and was sworn into office at the first sitting of the new National Assembly on 22 May 2019.[5] 
On 27 June 2019, she was named to the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development.[6] On 21 August 2019, she became a non-voting member of the Ad Hoc Committee to Amend Section 25 of the Constitution.[7] Mahlatsi became a voting member on 10 February 2020.[7] 
Mahlatsi supports land expropriation without compensation. During the debate on the 2020 State of the Nation Address on 18 February 2020, Mahlatsi said: "As the ANC, we are looking at land, not property ... 
Hon. Speaker, the poor must be given means of production in order to defeat poverty. Land must be used as economic asset."[8] In June 2020, she voted to re-establish the Ad Hoc Committee to Amend Section 25 of the Constitution after its term had expired. She said that the "land was stolen and must be returned" and that the ANC had considered the legal, economic and political implications of expropriation without compensation.[9] 
Matshidiso Melina Gomba is a South African politician who has been a Member of Parliament (MP) for the African National Congress since 2019.[1] 
She is currently the Chair of the Portfolio Committee on Tourism.[2] 
He holds a Master Degree in Public Administration (MPA) with MANCOSA[32] & is a certificated HTML coder[33] & practitioner. 
He was MMC responsible for Finance & Economic Development when the council received three consecutive "clean" audit outcomes. In 2011/12, 2012/13, 2013/14, one of only two municipalities out of 256 in SA to have accomplished this standard and improved its standing. Also, improving on the independent Local Economic Development Maturity Assessment from 14th position in 2011 to 1st in 2014 out of 30 municipalities in the Western Cape. 
As Western Region Campaign Manager in the 2014 national elections, involving 10 Municipal Constituencies, the Democratic Alliance improved with 23% support compared to the previous National election in 2009 and the Swartland Constituency – the 65% DA support of the 2011 local government elections was increased to 67% – retaining the reputation as a top-performing constituency in South Africa in local, provincial and national election outcomes. In the 2016 Local Government Elections, he was responsible for target tracking in the Western Region, which saw an increase of 19% over the 2011 election results. As a ward councilor in Swartland Local Municipality, Hunsinger improved support for the Democratic Alliance in ward 10 from 68% in 2006 to 93% in 2014 with a 73% voter participation. 
While serving as Constituency Head for Matzikama, the Democratic Alliance won 7 out of the 8 wards in the 2016 LGE. Before this, he also served as Constituency Head for Phillipi during which time profitable gains were recorded in support for the DA. Since February 2017, he serves as Political Leader and Constituency Head for Bergrivier, one of the only local government regions under DA governance, in full control of all wards of the Constituency since January 2019.[34] 
In 2006, Hunsinger was honored with the International Blue Heart Award in Berlin, Germany, for his contribution towards promoting various international youth partnerships between South Africa and Germany since 1997 – and in particular for the establishment of the annual International Sondeza Youth Camp[35] in Ganzekraal, South Africa,[36] in 2004. He was the 14th international and first African recipient of this prestigious prize and remains personally involved in volunteer projects and programs, which kicked off in 2005. Teenagers from the mainly rural Western Region of Western Cape have participated annually among 20 invited countries in leadership development programs at the Eurocamp in Kiez-Harz,[37] Güntersberge, Germany, Belgium, and South Africa since 1999, benefitting more than a thousand teenagers. 
Chris Hunsinger (born 23 October 1962) is a South African politician,[2] a Member of the South African Parliament[3] since 2014, Caucus Whip[4] and Treasurer[5] with the Democratic Alliance (South Africa).[6] He was appointed by the then Leader of the Opposition Mmusi Maimane on 5 June 2019 and retained by the current Leader of the Opposition John Steenhuisen in October 2019[7] and again in December 2020,[8] as The Shadow Minister of Transport. 
Hunsinger was re-elected to Parliament on 6 June 2019. He speaks and writes about issues related to consumer and commodity needs in transport, including safety,[9] planning, finance and management with South African road,[10] rail,[11] maritime,[12] and aviation service providers.[13] 
Hunsinger earned recognition[14] for his key role in the dramatic consolidation of all opposition parties in the last sessions of Parliament in Dec 2018 during consideration of the 'RABS Bill'. 
Referred to as; "...a stunning turnaround" (Times Live)[15] this speech [16]in the National Assembly of Parliament in RSA[17] highlighted the deficiencies of the Road Accident Benefit Scheme Bill, 2017 & presented a strong case of irrational design & manipulated process in the 2nd Reading Debate on 4 December 2018, whereas RABS intended to replace the Road Accident Fund Act 56 of 1996. With all other opposition parties following the paragon, the approval did not succeed on the day & was finally defeated a second time on 6 December 2018 & a further attempt (5 December 2018) was successfully stemmed via crafty application of NA Rules.[18] Despite amendments to the Bill tabled by Hunsinger being ‘negatived’ at the sitting,[19] all opposition parties walked out – rendering the House inquorate & unable to vote on its second reading & the Bill lapsed as a result.[20] In the early stages of being reintroduced during the 6th Parliament "Hunsinger convinced the Committee"[21] not to proceed with the RABS Bill. 
A rare achievement, which was ratified by Parliament on 3 September 2020.[22] 
The Bergrivier Local Government have achieved five consecutive clean audit outcomes since Hunsinger's appointment as constituency head in February 2017 and in 2019 the municipality was placed 8th in South Africa, 3rd in Western Cape Province, and 2nd in the Western Region[23] in the Good Governance Africa Performance Index conducted amongst 213 municipalities, using data on 15 indicators across three themes: administration, economic development & service delivery. 
Member of the National Assembly Portfolio Committee on Transport[24] covering:

Hunsinger was an entrepreneur in the retail and financial services industry. He was nominated as SA Best Practice Top 10 Finalist in 2009 and won the Celestis Best Practice Award of the Western Cape Province in the same year[30] 
In Atlas of Human Sex Anatomy (1949) by Robert Latou Dickinson, the typical clitoris is defined as having a crosswise width of 3 to 4 mm (0.12 - 0.16 inches) and a lengthwise width of 4 to 5 mm (0.16 - 0.20 inches).[15] On the other hand, in Obstetrics and Gynecology medical literature, a frequent definition of clitoromegaly is when there is a clitoral index (product of lengthwise and crosswise widths) of greater than 35 mm2 (0.05 inches2), which is almost twice the size given above for an average sized clitoral hood.[16] 
Early surgical reduction of clitoromegaly via full or partial clitoridectomy is controversial, and intersex women exposed to such treatment have spoken of their loss of physical sensation, and loss of autonomy.[17][18] In recent years, human rights institutions have criticized early surgical management of such characteristics.[19][20][21] 
In 2013, it was disclosed in a medical journal that four unnamed elite female athletes from developing countries were subjected to gonadectomies and partial clitoridectomies after testosterone testing revealed that they had an intersex condition.[22][23] In April 2016, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on health, Dainius Pūras, condemned this treatment as a form of female genital mutilation "in the absence of symptoms or health issues warranting those procedures."[24] 
Pseudo-penis, an enlarged clitoris or other penis-like structure that is normally present in some mammal, bird, and insect species 
Clitoromegaly (or macroclitoris[1]) is an abnormal enlargement of the clitoris that is mostly congenital or acquired, though deliberately induced clitoris enlargement as a form of female genital body modification is achieved through various uses of anabolic steroids, including testosterone.[2][3][4][5] Clitoromegaly is not the same as normal enlargement of the clitoris seen during sexual arousal. 
Clitoromegaly is a rare condition and can be either present by birth or acquired later in life. If present at birth, congenital adrenal hyperplasia can be one of the causes, since in this condition the adrenal gland of the female fetus produces additional androgens and the newborn baby has ambiguous genitalia which are not clearly male or female. In pregnant women who received norethisterone during pregnancy, masculinization of the fetus occurs, resulting in hypertrophy of the clitoris;[8] however, this is rarely seen nowadays due to use of safer progestogens. 
It can also be caused by the autosomal recessive congenital disorder known as Fraser syndrome.[9] 
In acquired clitoromegaly, the main cause is endocrine hormonal imbalance affecting the adult woman, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)[10] and hyperthecosis. 
Acquired clitoromegaly may also be caused by pathologies affecting the ovaries and other endocrine glands. 
These pathologies may include virulent (such as arrhenoblastoma) and neurofibromatosic tumors.[11] Another cause is clitoral cysts.[12] Sometimes there may be no obvious clinical or hormonal reason.[2] 
A clitoris piercing is a female genital piercing placed directly through the head (glans) of the clitoris itself. It is a relatively uncommon piercing by choice because of the potential for nerve damage,[1] and because women may find it too stimulating to allow the constant wearing of a small ring or barbell. It is often confused with the more common clitoral hood piercing, which pierces only the hood covering the clitoral glans,[1] allowing the jewellery to make only occasional contact with the most sensitive area. 
Depending on the anatomy of the individual, a clitoris piercing, especially a clitoral hood piercing, can be oriented either vertically or horizontally.[1] The clitoris is endowed with a very high concentration of nerve endings and like male genital piercings which penetrate the glans penis, clitoral piercings can be extremely sexually stimulating when subjected to gentle manipulation, or vibration, hence their popularity in certain S & M cultures, where small heavy ornaments are often fitted to increase the sensation. 
Piercer Elayne Angel stated that of the "very small number of women who genuinely desire a clitoris piercing (rather than the more common clitoral hood piercing), 90 to 95 percent are not suitably built to accommodate jewelry through the clitoral head."[2] The piercee must have a large enough clitoris to prevent migration of the piercing and subsequent loss because a slightly thicker gauge of jewellery is usually used to prevent the 'cheese-cutter' effect if it becomes caught on clothing, or is pulled too hard during sexual activity. 
This piercing is of contemporary origin and is uncommon. In 1989, piercer Jim Ward, interviewed by Andrea Juno in Modern Primitives, stated "I've been in the business for over 10 years and I haven't done more than half a dozen clit piercings."[3] 
The ridged band is a band of mobile skin near the end of the foreskin. It has, especially in regard to phimosis and preputioplasty, been called preputial ring or phimotic ring, ring being analogous to band, referring to the shape, and preputial meaning pertaining to the prepuce. 
More particularly, it refers to the transitional area from the external to the internal surface of the prepuce, or foreskin.[1][2][3][4][5] It is usually described as highly erogenous.[6][7][8] 
Taylor described the ridged band as a transversely ridged band of mucosal tissue, located just inside the tip of the foreskin near the mucocutaneous boundary, also known as the preputial sphincter. He characterized the ridged band as intensely vascular and richly innervated, stating that it "contains more Meissner's corpuscles than does the smooth mucosa", and noted that these tactile corpuscles were found only in the crests of ridges. 
The prepuce, including the ridged band, is a specific erogenous zone.[13] 
Work in progress indicates that retraction and stretching of this accordion-like structure triggers reflex contraction of bulbocavernosus and bulbospongiosus.[14] 
Taylor theorizes that the main function of the ridged band is to trigger sexual reflexes. In a letter to the editor of BJU International, 2007, Taylor writes: 
Initial study (J.R.T. unpublished) indicates that the real importance of the ridged band to sexual intercourse lies in an ability to trigger a reflex contraction of muscles responsible for ejaculation.[15] 
Both glans and prepuce contribute to the single mucocutaneous junctional zone of the penis and it is possible that these apparently dissimilar structures in fact share similar functions related more to sexual reflexes than to touch perception.[1] 
Along with the frenulum of the penis, it is considered to be the most sensitive part of the penis to fine-touch.[1][2][3][9] It was discovered by Canadian pathologist and medical researcher John Taylor in 1991. 
The structure is generally believed to be important in male sexual sensation and reflexes.[3][10][11] Most or all of the ridged band is removed by male circumcision due to its position on the prepuce.[10] 
The effect of circumcision on sexual function is the subject of intense debate. Taylor's view is that "almost certainly, removal of the prepuce and its ridged band distorts penile reflexogenic functions but exactly how and to what extent still remains to be seen".[1] More recent research has demonstrated that the clinically important bulbocavernosus reflex is absent in 73% of circumcised men ostensibly due to the removal of fine-touch nerve endings in the ridged band.[16] 
For an overview of the issues surrounding male circumcision and sexual function, see Sexual effects of circumcision. 
Taylor first used the term "ridged band" instead of "wrinkly skin" and described the structure at the Second International Symposium on Circumcision, organized by NOCIRC in San Francisco, 1991, after examining the foreskins of 22 adults obtained at autopsy. The term ridged band was subsequently used by him in an anatomical and histological study of the foreskin published in the British Journal of Urology in 1996. 
The mean age was 37 years, range 22–58. The prepuces were studied grossly and histologically.[1][2][3] 
In August 2021, the Italian biomedical company Foregen announced that it would be conducting a histological study of the ridged band, along with other parts of the foreskin, in its efforts to regenerate it, the frenulum, and preputial mucosa of the prepuce.[12] 
Phimosis is a condition in which the foreskin of the penis cannot stretch to allow it to be pulled back past the glans.[3] A balloon-like swelling under the foreskin may occur with urination.[3] In teenagers and adults, it may result in pain during an erection, but is otherwise not painful.[3] Those affected are at greater risk of inflammation of the glans, known as balanitis, and other complications.[3] 
Pathological phimosis (as opposed to the natural non-retractability of the foreskin in childhood) is rare, and the causes are varied. Some cases may arise from balanitis (inflammation of the glans penis).[28] 
Phimosis may occur after other types of chronic inflammation (such as balanoposthitis), repeated catheterization, or forcible foreskin retraction.[31] 
In young children, it is normal not to be able to pull back the foreskin at all.[1] Over 90% of cases resolve by the age of seven, although full retraction is still prevented by preputial adhesions in over half at this age.[5][7] Occasionally, phimosis may be caused by an underlying condition such as scarring due to balanitis or balanitis xerotica obliterans.[5] This can typically be diagnosed by seeing scarring of the opening of the foreskin.[5] 
Beaugé noted that unusual masturbation practices, such as thrusting against the bed or rubbing the foreskin forward may cause phimosis. Patients are advised to stop exacerbating masturbation techniques and are encouraged to masturbate by moving the foreskin up and down so as to mimic more closely the action of sexual intercourse. After giving this advice Beaugé noted not once did he have to recommend circumcision.[33][34] 
Typically, the condition resolves without treatment by the age of 18.[1] Efforts to pull back the foreskin during the early years of a young male's life should not be attempted.[7] For those in whom the condition does not improve further, time can be given or a steroid cream may be used to attempt to loosen the tight skin.[7] If this method, combined with stretching exercises, is not effective, then other treatments such as circumcision may be recommended.[7] A potential complication of phimosis is paraphimosis, where the tight foreskin becomes trapped behind the glans.[3] The word is from Greek φίμωσις phimōsis 'muzzling'.[9][10][11]

Dorsal slit (superincision) is a single incision along the upper length of the foreskin from the tip to the corona, exposing the glans without removing any tissue. 
Ventral slit (subincision) is an incision along the lower length of the foreskin from the tip of the frenulum to the base of the glans, removing the frenulum in the process. Often used when frenulum breve occurs alongside the phimosis. 
Preputioplasty, in which a limited dorsal slit with transverse closure is made along the constricting band of skin,[40] can be an effective alternative to circumcision.[2] It has the advantage of only limited pain and a short healing duration relative to circumcision, while also avoiding cosmetic effects.[40] Circumcision is sometimes performed for phimosis, and is an effective treatment; however, this method has become less common as of 2012.[3] 
While circumcision prevents phimosis, studies of the incidence of healthy infants circumcised for each prevented case of phimosis are inconsistent.[1][2] 
The most acute complication is paraphimosis. In this condition, the glans is swollen and painful, and the foreskin is immobilized by the swelling in a partially retracted position. 
The proximal penis is flaccid. 
Some studies found phimosis to be a risk factor for urinary retention[41] and carcinoma of the penis.[42] 
At birth, the inner layer of the foreskin is sealed to the glans penis. The foreskin is usually non-retractable in early childhood, and some males may reach the age of 18 before their foreskin can be fully retracted.[12] 
Medical associations advise not to retract the foreskin of an infant, in order to prevent scarring.[13][14] Some argue that non-retractability may "be considered normal for males up to and including adolescence."[15][16] Hill states that full retractability of the foreskin may not be achieved until late childhood or early adulthood.[17] A Danish survey found that the mean age of first foreskin retraction is 10.4 years.[18] 
Frenulum breve, or short frenulum, is a condition in which the frenulum of the penis, which is an elastic band of tissue under the glans penis that connects to the foreskin and helps contract it over the glans, is too short and thus restricts the movement of the foreskin. The frenulum should normally be sufficiently long and supple to allow for the full retraction of the foreskin so that it lies smoothly back on the shaft of the erect penis. 
Frenulum breve may be complicated by tearing of the frenulum during sexual or other activity and is a cause of dyspareunia. It may lead to erroneous labelling of the sufferer as having psychosexual problems.[1] The torn frenulum may result in healing with scar tissue that is less flexible after the incident causing further difficulties.[citation needed] However, this tearing can also solve the problem, healing such that the frenulum is longer and therefore no longer problematic.[citation needed] 
The diagnosis of frenulum breve is almost always confused with that of phimosis and a generally tight foreskin, since the symptom is difficulty retracting the foreskin. 
Most men with phimosis also have frenulum breve to a certain extent.[2] 
The condition may be treated with stretching exercises and steroid creams. It also may be treated with surgery. 
There are several different techniques to treat this condition. 
Threading a suture through the lower membrane, and then tying a tight knot around the frenulum itself is a procedure that minimises invasive action. 
After a few days the frenulum will weaken and eventually break apart to allow the prepuce to fully retract. Other procedures involve the cutting of the skin and require the use of sutures to help in the healing process. Alternatively, it may be treated by a reparative plastic surgery operation called a frenuloplasty, or by complete circumcision including resection of the frenulum (frenectomy). 
Paraphimosis is usually caused by medical professionals (iatrogenic) or parents who handle the foreskin improperly.[1][2] The foreskin may be retracted during penile examination, penile cleaning, urethral catheterization, or cystoscopy; if the foreskin is left retracted for a long period, some of the foreskin tissue may become edematous (swollen with fluid), which makes subsequent reduction of the foreskin difficult.[citation needed] 
Paraphimosis can be avoided by bringing the foreskin back into its normal, forward, non-retracted position after retraction is no longer necessary (for instance, after cleaning the glans penis or placing a Foley catheter). Phimosis (both pathologic and normal childhood physiologic forms) is a risk factor for paraphimosis;[5] physiologic phimosis resolves naturally as a child matures, but it may be advisable to treat pathologic phimosis via long-term stretching or elective surgical techniques (such as preputioplasty to loosen the preputial orifice or circumcision to amputate the foreskin tissue partially or completely).[citation needed] 
The foreskin responds to the application of tension to cause expansion by creating new skin cells though the process of mitosis. The tissue expansion is permanent. 
Non-surgical stretching of the foreskin may be used to widen a narrow, non-retractable foreskin.[7] Stretching may be combined with the use of a corticosteroid cream.[8][9] Beaugé recommends manual stretching for young males in preference to circumcision as a treatment for non-retractile foreskin because of the preservation of sexual sensation.[10] 
Paraphimosis can often be effectively treated by manual manipulation of the swollen foreskin tissue. This involves compressing the glans penis and moving the foreskin back to its normal position, perhaps with the aid of a lubricant, cold compression, and local anesthesia as necessary. 
If this fails, the tight edematous band of tissue can be relieved surgically with a dorsal slit[4][6] or circumcision.[11][12][13][14][15] An alternative method, the Dundee technique, entails placing multiple punctures in the swollen foreskin with a fine needle, and then expressing the edema fluid by manual pressure.[12] According to Ghory and Sharma, treatment by circumcision may be elected as "a last resort, to be performed by a urologist".[16] Other experts recommend delaying elective circumcision until after paraphimosis has been resolved.[4] 
Phimosis Circumcision Preputioplasty 
Only one incision is shown in Figure 3; if two or more such incisions are made this will prevent a V-shaped indentation at the opening of the foreskin when the penis is not erect. If incisions are placed on the sides of the phimotic ring, the ultimate cosmetic result is better. It is also recommended that the subcutaneous tissue be undermined to ensure a better cosmetic result. 
The opening of the foreskin is now normally wide enough for the foreskin to be easily retracted. The foreskin is also slightly shorter (by half the length of the longitudinal incisions which are now closed transversely) because the widening of the phimotic ring takes up some foreskin length. Studies from a large cohort in the Indian Subcontinent show a good acceptance and an interest for foreskin preservation when there is no religious indication to remove the foreskin.

In some cases the foreskin may become swollen as a result of paraphimosis (foreskin trapped behind the glans) or other conditions such as severe balanitis. Should reduction of the swelling by conservative methods be unsuccessful, a dorsal slit is a common intervention of choice since circumcision is almost always excluded in such cases.[11][12] While it was formerly recommended that circumcision be subsequently performed once the originating condition has subsided,[13] this appears to be no longer the case.[14] 
However, the Maasai operation is different in this: rather than a dorsal slit from the opening of the prepuce to the corona, a heart shaped "oval" is excised from the dorsum of the prepuce and the glans is pushed through this hole. Later the edges of the cut prepuce will heal. 
The prepuce is first cut off, leaving only a small part where the main veins are located, which is pulled down and the small hole through which the glans in pushed through is created. The remaining part is left hanging down, but the glans exposed. 
Formerly tribes that copied the Maasai like the numerous Kikuyu of Kenya also practised the same form of circumcision. Photos of the operation and result are numerously found in specialized African books, such as Carol Beckwith and Tepelit Ole Saitoti's Maasai. 
There are words for the resultant "preputial flap" in the Maa and Gikuyu languages, and possibly in other African tongues. In Gikuyu the word, now archaic, is likely to be ngwati. 
One patient presented with a dorsal slit because of an acute infection during childhood. All of the normal preputial skin was still present and the patient wished the skin restored to a normal appearance. An inverted V-shaped incision was made where the dorsal slit had been and the two edges were sutured together, thus, reproducing the normal prepuce. 
It could be that this might be an answer to some critics of circumcision. A simple dorsal slit can be performed in patients who have phimosis or severe recurrent infections. At a later date, if they wished restoration, reconstruction to the uncircumcised appearance would be simple.[15] 
In Western medicine it was used as an alternative to circumcision to relieve conditions such as failure of the foreskin to retract (phimosis) or failure to cover the glans penis (paraphimosis), although a perception of poor appearance limited its popularity. While it is a less invasive surgery than circumcision, it is more invasive than preputioplasty since it leaves the incision open. It is still used when circumcision or other measures are considered impractical or undesirable. 
Since superincision and circumcision are both forms of genital cutting that expose the glans, it can often be difficult to know which procedure is being described or depicted. Opinion is divided on whether a 4,000-year-old image from Egypt, often described as the first depiction of circumcision, may in fact be of a superincision.[2] 
Superincision has been widely practised by people of the Pacific, stretching from Hawaii[3] to the Philippines.[4] However, with increasing urbanisation, traditional rituals have been giving way in many places to medically performed circumcision, and almost entirely so among Islanders living in New Zealand, where a recent survey found there was "a strong cultural demand from parents".[5] The most notable exception to Pacific superincision is the Māori of New Zealand, who do not circumcise or superincise,[6] although they have an indigenous term for the latter (ure haea or "split penis") and their tradition is that they stopped the practice when they arrived in New Zealand.[7] 
Dorsal slit has a long history as a treatment for adult phimosis,[1] since compared with circumcision it was relatively easy to perform, did not risk damage to the frenulum, and before the invention of antibiotics was less likely to become infected. However, the literature often indicates that despite being "a simple operation" it was "not liked by some"[8] or refers to the "untidy apron-like appearance" it could produce.[9] Dorsal slit is now rare in Western countries as a treatment for phimosis. 
Standard guidelines suggest conservative approaches first and, should those fail, either circumcision or preputioplasty to both retain the foreskin and relieve the phimosis.[10] 
Priapism is a condition in which a penis remains erect for hours in the absence of stimulation or after stimulation has ended.[1] There are three types: ischemic (low-flow), nonischemic (high-flow), and recurrent ischemic (intermittent).[3] Most cases are ischemic.[3] Ischemic priapism is generally painful while nonischemic priapism is not.[3] In ischemic priapism, most of the penis is hard; however, the glans penis is not.[3] In nonischemic priapism, the entire penis is only somewhat hard.[3] Very rarely, clitoral priapism occurs in women.[4] 
Because ischemic priapism causes the blood to remain in the penis for unusually long periods of time, the blood becomes deprived of oxygen, which can cause damage to the penile tissue. Such damage can result in erectile dysfunction or disfigurement of the penis.[9] In extreme cases, if the penis develops severe vascular disease, the priapism can result in penile gangrene.[10] 
Sickle cell disease is the most common cause of ischemic priapism.[1] Other causes include medications such as antipsychotics, SSRIs, blood thinners and prostaglandin E1, as well as drugs such as cocaine and cannabis.[3][5] Ischemic priapism occurs when blood does not adequately drain from the penis.[3] Nonischemic priapism is typically due to a connection forming between an artery and the corpus cavernosum or disruption of the parasympathetic nervous system resulting in increased arterial flow.[3] Nonischemic priapism may occur following trauma to the penis or a spinal cord injury.[3] Diagnosis may be supported by blood gas analysis of blood aspirated from the penis or an ultrasound.[3] 
Blood gas testing the blood from the cavernosa of the penis can help in the diagnosis.[1] If the low flow type of priapism is present, the blood typically has a low pH, while if the high flow type is present, the pH is typically normal.[3] Color doppler ultrasound may also help differentiate the two.[3] Testing a person to make sure they do not have a hemoglobinopathy may also be reasonable.[3] 
Penile ultrasonography with doppler is the imaging method of choice, because it is noninvasive, widely available, and highly sensitive. By means of this method, it is possible to diagnose priapism and differentiate between its low- and high-flow forms.[11] 
In low-flow (ischemic) priapism the flow in the cavernous arteries is reduced or absent. As the condition progresses, there is an increase in echogenicity of the corpora cavernosa, attributed to tissue edema. Eventually, changes in the echotexture of the corpora cavernosa can be observed due to the fibrotic transformation generated by tissue anoxia.[1] 
In high-flow priapism normal or increased, turbulent blood flow in the cavernous arteries is seen. The area surrounding the fistula presents a hypoechoic, irregular lesion in the cavernous tissue.[1] 
Medical evaluation is recommended for erections that last for longer than four hours. Pain can often be reduced with a dorsal penile nerve block or penile ring block.[1] For those with nonischemic priapism, cold packs and pressure to the area may be sufficient.[3] 
Orally administered pseudoephedrine is a first-line treatment for priapism.[14] Erection is largely a parasympathetic response, so the sympathetic action of pseudoephedrine may serve to relieve this condition. 
Pseudoephedrine is an alpha-agonist agent that exerts a constriction effect on smooth muscle of corpora cavernosum, which in turn facilitates venous outflow. 
Treatment depends on the type.[3] Ischemic priapism is typically treated with a nerve block of the penis followed by aspiration of blood from the corpora cavernosa.[3] If this is not sufficient, the corpus cavernosum may be irrigated with cold, normal saline or injected with phenylephrine.[3] Nonischemic priapism is often treated with cold packs and compression.[3] Surgery may be done if usual measures are not effective.[3] In ischemic priapism, the risk of permanent scarring of the penis begins to increase after four hours and definitely occurs after 48 hours.[3][6] Priapism occurs in about 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 100,000 males per year.[3] 
For those with ischemic priapism, the initial treatment is typically aspiration of blood from the corpus cavernosum.[1] This is done on either side.[3] If this is not sufficiently effective, then cold normal saline may be injected and removed.[3] 
If aspiration is not sufficient, a small dose of phenylephrine may be injected into the corpus cavernosum.[1] Side effects of phenylephrine may include: high blood pressure, slow heart rate, and arrhythmia.[3] If this medication is used, it is recommended that people be monitored for at least an hour after.[3] For those with recurrent ischemic priapism, diethylstilbestrol (DES) or terbutaline may be tried.[3] 
In sickle-cell anemia, treatment is initially with intravenous fluids, pain medication, and oxygen therapy.[17][2] The typical treatment of priapism may be carried out as well.[3] Blood transfusions are not usually recommended as part of the initial treatment, but if other treatments are not effective, exchange transfusion may be done.[17][3] 
Priapism is classified into three groups: ischemic (low-flow), nonischemic (high-flow), and recurrent ischemic.[1] The majority of cases (19 out of 20) are ischemic in nature.[3] 
Some sources give a duration of four hours as a definition of priapism, but others give six. "The duration of a normal erection before it is classifiable as priapism is still controversial. Ongoing penile erections for more than 6 hours can be classified as priapism."[7] 
Priapism in females (continued, painful erection of the clitoris) is significantly rarer than priapism in men and is known as clitoral priapism or clitorism.[1] It is associated with persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD).[8] Only a few case reports of women experiencing clitoral priapism exist.[4] 
Chordee is a condition in which the head of the penis curves downward or upward, at the junction of the head and shaft of the penis. The curvature is usually most obvious during erection, but resistance to straightening is often apparent in the flaccid state as well. 
In many cases but not all, chordee is associated with hypospadias. This is not the same condition as Peyronie's disease, which involves curvature of the shaft of the penis most commonly due to injury during adult life. 
The principal treatment of chordee is surgery in infancy,[6] usually by a pediatric urologist. With chordees caused by circumcision, the preferred method of surgical treatment is a z-plasty.[7] The preferred time for surgery is between the ages of 6 and 18 months and correction is usually successful.[citation needed] 
It is usually considered a congenital malformation of unknown cause. Since at an early stage of fetal development the penis is curved downward, it has been proposed that chordee results from an arrest of penile development at that stage.[citation needed] 
The curvature of a chordee can involve[citation needed] 
Severe degrees of chordee are usually associated with hypospadias, but mild degrees of curvature may occur in many otherwise normal males. When the curved penis is small and accompanied by hypospadias, deficiency of prenatal androgen effect can be inferred. [citation needed] 
A chordee may be caused by an underlying condition, such as a disorder of sex development or an intersex condition, or from a complication of circumcision,[2][3] though some medical professionals do not consider it to be true chordee because the corporal bodies are normally formed.[4] However, not all congenital chordee includes abnormal corpora, and case reports of damage to the corpus cavernosum from circumcision are noted in the literature; particularly as a complication of local anesthetic.[5] 
Aposthia is a rare congenital condition in humans, in which the foreskin of the penis is missing.[1]: 37–39 
Some traditions in Islam say Muhammad was born without a foreskin.[5] 
Lazarus Long, principal protagonist in several of Robert Heinlein's novels, was born aposthic.[6] 
Toward the end of the nineteenth century, E. S. Talbot claimed that aposthia among Jews was evidence for the now-discredited Lamarckian theory of evolution.[2] In his work The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, Charles Darwin also mentioned cases of "born circumcised" babies as "conclusive evidence"[3] for the now-discredited blending inheritance. 
The Midrash of Ki-Tetze [כי תצא] claims that Moses was born aposthic. 
Other sources[which?] that Jacob, his son Gad and King David were also born aposthic. The book Abot De-Rabbi Natan (The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan) contains a list of persons from the Israelite Scriptures that were "born circumcised": Adam, Seth, Noah, Shem, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, the wicked Balaam, Samuel, David, Jeremiah and Zerubbabel.[4] Jewish law requires males born without a foreskin or who lost their foreskin through means other than a formal circumcision ceremony (brit milah ברית מילה) to have a drop of blood (hatafat-dam, הטפת דם) let from the penis at the point where the foreskin would have been (or was) attached. 
The Talmud (Shabbat 135A) records a discussion of whether the importance of this letting of blood supersedes Shabbat, on which only a boy who was born the previous Shabbat can be circumcised. If a regular circumcision is delayed, there is no disagreement that this may not be performed on Shabbat. However, in the case of aposthia, there are two schools of thought.[citation needed] 
R. Elazar Hakappar said that the school of Shamai and Hillel do not differ as to a boy that is born without a foreskin. Both agree that the blood of the covenant must be drawn from the glans. The school of Shamai, however, contends that this may be done on the Sabbath, while the other holds that the Sabbath must not be desecrated on that account.[citation needed] 
The rabbis in Rabat proclaimed that this foretold that Levy would grow up to be a "leader of Israel", even though the State was not founded until Levy was 11, in 1948. This proclamation was not necessarily prophetic of the founding of Israel, for "Israel" is a term that can be used to refer to "the Jewish people".[citation needed] 
A bifid penis (or double penis) is a rare congenital defect where two genital tubercles develop.[1][2] 
Many male marsupials such as the kangaroo naturally have a bifid penis, with left and right prongs that they insert into multiple vaginal canals simultaneously.[3] 
It is less common among people who are circumcised, as in many cases, a dysfunction of the foreskin is a causal or contributing factor.[1] Both not enough cleaning and too much cleaning can cause problems.[1] Diabetes can make balanitis more likely, especially if the blood sugar is poorly controlled.[7] 
Zoon's balanitis, also known as Balanitis Circumscripta Plasmacellularis or plasma cell balanitis (PCB), is an idiopathic, rare, benign penile dermatosis[8] for which circumcision is often the preferred treatment.[8][9][10] Zoon's balanitis has been successfully treated with the carbon dioxide laser; [11] and more recently, Albertini and colleagues report the avoidance of circumcision and successful treatment of Zoon's balanitis with an Er:YAG laser.[12] Another study, by Retamar and colleagues, found that 40 percent of those treated with CO2 laser relapsed.[13] Circinate balanitis, also known as balanitis circinata, is a serpiginous annular dermatitis associated with reactive arthritis. 
Pseudoepitheliomatous keratotic and micaceous balanitis 
Initial treatment in adults often involves simply pulling back the foreskin and cleaning the penis.[1] However, some topical antibiotic and fungal ointments may be used for treatment for mild cases. Depending upon severity, hydrocortisone and other steroidal creams may be used upon consultation. 
Balanitis is inflammation of the glans penis.[1] When the foreskin is also affected, the proper term is balanoposthitis.[1] Balanitis on boys still in diapers must be distinguished from redness caused by ammoniacal dermatitis.[2] The word balanitis is from the Greek βάλανος balanos, literally meaning 'acorn', used because of the similarity in shape to the glans penis.[3] 
In dogs, balanoposthitis is caused by a disruption in the integumentary system, such as a wound or intrusion of a foreign body. A dog with this condition behaves normally, with the exception of excessive licking at the prepuce, and a yellow green, pus-like discharge is usually present. 
Signs and symptoms 
Recurrent bouts of balanitis may cause scarring of the preputial orifice; the reduced elasticity may lead to pathologic phimosis.[4] Further complications may include: 
Stricture of urethral meatus Phimosis Paraphimosis 
Inflammation has many possible causes, including irritation by environmental substances, physical trauma, and infection such as bacterial, viral, or fungal.[5][6] Some of these infections are sexually transmitted diseases. 
Posthitis (pronounced pos-THI-tis) is the inflammation of the foreskin (prepuce) of the human penis. It is characterised by swelling and redness on the skin and it may be accompanied by a smelly discharge. 
The treatment depends on identification of the cause. 
Irritants in the environment should be removed. Antibiotics and antifungals can be used to treat the infection,[1] but good hygiene such as keeping the area dry is essential to stop recurrence, however excessive washing with soap can cause contact dermatitis.[2] 
Posthitis and balanitis (inflammation of the glans penis) usually occur together as balanoposthitis. Circumcision can prevent balanoposthitis, though balanitis can still occur separately. 
Posthitis can have infectious causes such as bacteria or fungi, or non-infectious causes such as contact dermatitis or psoriasis. The inflammation may be caused by irritants in the environment. Common causative organisms include candida, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. 
Posthitis can lead to phimosis, the tightening of the foreskin which makes it difficult to retract over the glans. Posthitis can also lead to superficial ulcerations and diseases of the inguinal lymph nodes. 
Hygiene, in particular the regular cleaning of the glans, is generally considered sufficient to prevent infection and inflammation of the foreskin. Full retraction of the foreskin may not be possible in boys younger than about ten years and some may not be able to fully retract their foreskin for cleaning until their late teens. 
Sclerosing lymphangitis, also known as lymphangiosclerosis or sclerotic lymphangitis,[1] is a skin condition characterized by a cordlike structure encircling the coronal sulcus of the penis, or running the length of the shaft, that has been attributed to trauma during vigorous sexual play.[2]: 43 
Nonvenereal sclerosing lymphangitis is a rare penile lesion consisting of a minimally tender, indurated cord involving the coronal sulcus and occasionally adjacent distal penile skin. The condition involves the hardening of a lymph vessel connected to a vein in the penis. It can look like a thick cord and can feel like a hardened, almost calcified or fibrous, vein, however it tends to not share the common blue tint with a vein. 
In most cases it tends to go away if given rest and more gentle care, for example by use of lubricants. Even without rest or gentle care, in some cases it will simply disappear after a few weeks on its own. Spontaneous recovery can occur anywhere within a couple weeks to several months.[citation needed] 
While not every obese male has the buried penis condition, 87% of men that received surgical treatment for buried penis were reported to be obese. Significant overlying abdominal fat can also create an environment that encourages bacterial and fungal growth. Obesity can also increase the likelihood of the development of type II diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by increase susceptibility to infections, making it difficult to successfully and promptly manage the buried penis condition. 
Such recurring infections can also lead to scar contracture, which can cause the prepubic skin to shift over the shaft and glans, thus invaginating the shaft's skin and leading to a buried penis.[6][7] 
BXO is a chronic inflammatory dermatological process that causes sclerosis of the glans, shaft, prepuce, or urethra. This can result in a cicatrix of the distal penis and its entrapment.[10] 
Dysgenic dartos is a condition characterized by a lack of dorsal support together with the hypermobility of the ventral skin and the lack of proper attachment between the dartos and the penis. This can enable the penis to "telescope" into the scrotum, thus creating a buried penis.[11] 
Buried penis (also known as hidden penis or retractile penis) is a congenital or acquired condition, in which the penis is partially or completely hidden below the surface of the skin. It was first described by Edward Lawrence Keyes in 1919 as the apparent absence of the penis and as being buried beneath the skin of the abdomen, thigh, or scrotum.[1] Further research was done by Maurice Campbell in 1951 when he reported on the penis being buried beneath subcutaneous fat of the scrotum, perineum, hypogastrium, and thigh.[2] 
Adults with a buried penis will either live with their condition or undergo weight-loss programs. However, weight-loss programs are slow and often do not "unbury" the penis; furthermore, poor hygiene from pooling of urine can lead to soft tissue infection. 
While the condition may resolve itself without any intervention in very young children, patients may eventually need definitive reconstructive surgery and more urgent surgery if infection is present.[12][13][14][15][16][17] Surgeons who manage this condition are either reconstructive urologic surgeons or plastic surgeons.[citation needed] 
Surgical options could include the detachment of the ligaments connecting the base of the penis to the pubic bone; the performance of skin grafts to cover areas of the penis requiring additional skin; liposuction using catheters to suck out fat cells under the skin from the area around the penis; an abdominoplasty in which excess fat and skin from the region are removed; an escutheonectomy in which the pad of fat just above the pubic area is removed; or a panniculectomy in which the panniculus, excess tissue, and skin that hangs over the genitals and thighs are removed.[18] In a video demonstrating the use of a panniculectomy in the repair of adult buried penis, Dr. Bryan Voelzke and his colleagues emphasized the need to tack the suprapubic fat pad to the periosteum of the symphysis pubis as well as the importance of not pulling down the peno-scrotal junction and peno-abdominal junction just in order to further expose the penis.[19] 
Micropenis Phalloplasty Webbed penis 
Congenital causes can include the maldevelopment of the penile shaft with a lack of attachments of the shaft skin to the penile shaft. While rare, it can include an abnormally large pubic fat pad and firm tissue that pulls the penis inward.[4] Congenitial buried penis can be corrected surgically in childhood by anchoring the corpora cavernosa to dartos bundles at the penile base.[5] 
A penile injury is a medical emergency that afflicts the penis. Common injuries include fracture, avulsion, strangulation, entrapment, and amputation.[1] 
Degloving and avulsion injuries involve the removal of the penis skin, which is a serious medical emergency. Treatment of these injuries involves either closure of the torn skin, or a skin graft to replace the skin lost in the injury. Skin grafts are constructed to attempt to preserve erectile function and sensation.[1] 
Strangulation injuries to the penis, also called incarceration injuries, caused by hair, rubber bands, or other objects are the second most common soft tissue injury in children.[6][7] Hair strangulation may be hard to diagnose due to the anatomy of the penis; the hair causing the strangulation may be hidden under the coronal sulcus if it is swollen.[3] In adults, strangulation injuries that require medical treatment can be caused by a variety of objects typically used for the purpose of sexual gratification, extending the time of an erection, or enuresis, including metal rings, which must be removed by specialized cutting instruments. 
The object can also be removed by decompressing the penis.[6][7] Because the vasculature of the penis is compressed, a variety of complications can result from strangulation injuries, depending on whether the veins, arteries, or both are compressed, including mild, reversible vascular obstruction; ischemic necrosis; gangrene and kidney damage; lymphedema; ulceration; urethrocutaneous fistula, loss of sensation; urethral injury; sepsis; and autoamputation.[7] 
Wedding ring[10][11] Steel ring [12][13][14] Bottle [15] Chastity belt 
The most common soft-tissue injury is an entrapment injury involving the penis caught in a zipper; these injuries are particularly common in young children who are uncircumcised and are always superficial. They are treated by removing the zipper with local anesthesia using a bone cutter, lubrication, or hacksaw, dismantling the zipper, or removing the affected tissue, and can be prevented in most situations by circumcision.[1][2] If not treated promptly, the affected tissue can swell and become infected.[6] In some cases, emergency circumcision is necessary.[3] 
Penile fractures are the result of rupture of the tunica albuginea. 
They are fairly rare and can co-occur with partial or complete urethral rupture, though this is rare.[2][3][4] Urethral damage occurs in 10–38% of cases.[4] Fractures are treated with emergency surgery, and can be diagnosed with ultrasound, especially in pediatric cases.[2][3][4] Penile fractures are caused by trauma to the erect penis, typically by suddenly bending it laterally during penetrative intercourse with the receptive partner on top of the penetrating partner, or during masturbation. 
Characterized by a loud popping sound at the time of the injury, the result of the tunica albuginea rupturing. 
Other symptoms include severe pain, loss of erection, and swelling.[5] Symptoms of urethral injury include hematuria, blood at the meatus, and dysuria.[1] If left untreated, complications result in 28–53% of cases; these include permanent curvature of the penis, fistula, urethral diverticulum, priapism, and erectile dysfunction.[5] 
Hard flaccid syndrome (HFS), also known as hard flaccid (HF), is a chronic painful condition characterized by a semi-rigid penis at the flaccid state, a soft glans at the erect state, pelvic pain, low libido, erectile dysfunction, erectile pain, pain on ejaculation, penile sensory changes (numbness or coldness), lower urinary tract symptoms, contraction of the pelvic floor muscles, and psychological distress.[1] Other complaints include rectal and perineal discomfort, cold hands and feet, and a hollow or detached feeling inside the penile shaft. The majority of HFS patients are in their 20s–30s and symptoms significantly affect one's quality of life.[2] 
Sufferers typically report the onset of symptoms after trauma due to a mishap during sexual intercourse or tough masturbation, specifically a traumatic injury at the base of the erect penis,[3] possibly affecting the dorsal artery of the penis, the bulbourethral and the pudendal arteries, as well as the pudendal and dorsal nerve of the penis.[4] Penile sensory and textural changes, as well as changes in appearance, are hallmarks of the condition and serve to distinguish HFS from classic chronic pelvic pain syndrome or BPH.[3] 
Both biological and psychological influences contribute to the condition by altering the neurovascular supply to the muscles of the pelvic floor and penis. One theory proposes that HFS is a result of an initial stress which triggers an abnormal fight or flight response resulting in increased sympathetic stimulation to the muscles of the pelvis via the perineal branch of the pudendal nerve. In turn, a surge of adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol is released from the efferent nerve fibers promoting increased blood flow to the bulbospongiosus, ischiocavernous and levator ani muscles as well as sustained muscle contraction which results in obstructed venous outflow from the penis via compression of the deep dorsal vein and pelvic myoneuropathy secondary to neurogenic inflammation.[medical citation needed]u 
Treatment may include medications for pain management, pelvic floor physical therapy, biofeedback, and stress reduction techniques. Men experiencing anxiety or depression may benefit from counseling.[5] 
On December 28, 2020 the Hardflaccidinfo website has been created to collect informations about HardFlaccid and to spread them.[6] 
Webbed penis also known as buried or concealed penis is an acquired or congenital condition in which the scrotal skin extends onto the ventral penile shaft. The penile shaft is buried in the scrotum or tethered to the scrotal midline by a fold or web of skin. The urethra and erectile bodies are usually normal. 
Webbed penis is usually asymptomatic, but the cosmetic appearance is often unacceptable. This condition may be corrected by surgical techniques.[1][2][3][4] 
Erectile dysfunction (ED), also called impotence, is the type of sexual dysfunction in which the penis fails to become or stay erect during sexual activity. It is the most common sexual problem in men.[1] Through its connection to self-image and to problems in sexual relationships, erectile dysfunction can cause psychological harm. 
In about 80% of cases, physical causes can be identified.[1] These include cardiovascular disease; diabetes mellitus; neurological problems, such as those following prostatectomy; hypogonadism; and drug side effects. About 10% of cases are psychological impotence, caused by thoughts or feelings;[2] here, there is a strong response to placebo treatment. 
The term erectile dysfunction is not used for other disorders of erection, such as priapism. 
Treatment involves addressing the underlying causes, lifestyle modifications, and addressing psychosocial problems.[1] In many cases, treatment is attempted by drugs, specifically PDE5 inhibitors (such as sildenafil), which dilate blood vessels, allowing more blood to flow through the spongy tissue of the penis (akin to opening a valve further in order to allow more water to enter a fire hose). Other treatments, less commonly used, include prostaglandin pellets, inserted in the urethra; smooth-muscle relaxants and vasodilators, injected into the penis; penile implants; penis pumps; and vascular reconstructive surgery.[2][3] 
Signs and symptoms 
ED often has an impact on the emotional well-being of both men and their partners. Many men do not seek treatment due to feelings of embarrassment. About 75% of diagnosed cases of ED go untreated.[4] 
It is defined as the "persistent or recurrent inability to achieve and maintain a penile erection of sufficient rigidity to permit satisfactory sexual activity for at least 3 months."[2] 
Summer penile syndrome (also known as 'Lions Mane Penis')[1] is a seasonal pediatric medical condition characterized by redness, swelling (edema), and itching (pruritus) of the penile skin.[2] 
Summer penile syndrome is usually caused by chigger bites on the penis, or, more rarely by exposure of the genital region to plants like poison ivy, sumac, and oak.[1][3] The majority of cases occur in the summer months, with the clothing associated with warmer weather making penis-arachnid and penis-plant contact more likely.[3] 
First line treatments for Summer penile syndrome include oral antihistamines and cold compresses. In extreme cases where the sufferer is in severe pain or is unable to pass urine, systemic corticosteroids are considered.[1] 
Peyronie's disease is a connective tissue disorder involving the growth of fibrous plaques in the soft tissue of the penis. Specifically, scar tissue forms in the tunica albuginea, the thick sheath of tissue surrounding the corpora cavernosa, causing pain, abnormal curvature, erectile dysfunction, indentation, loss of girth and shortening.[1][3] 
The underlying cause of Peyronie's disease is unknown. Although, it is likely due to a buildup of plaque inside the penis due to repeated mild sexual trauma or injury during sexual intercourse or physical activity.[1] 
Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, Dupuytren's contracture, plantar fibromatosis, penile trauma, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, genetic predisposition, and European heritage.[9][10][11] 
This ultrasound depicts cross sections of the penis at different locations in a patient with Peyronie's disease. The top image shows normal anatomy whereas the bottom image shows scar tissue on the tunica albuginea (penis). The scar tissue is localized and responsible for the hallmark deformities of Peyronie's disease (curvature and narrowing). 
A urologist may be able to diagnose the disease and suggest treatment. An ultrasound can provide conclusive evidence of Peyronie's disease, ruling out congenital curvature or other disorders.[12] 
It is estimated to affect about 10% of men.[2] The condition becomes more common with age.[2] 
Many oral treatments have been studied but results so far have been mixed.[14] Some consider the use of nonsurgical approaches to be "controversial".[15] 
Collagenase clostridium histolyticum is reported to help by breaking down the excess collagen in the penis.[18][19] It was approved for treatment of Peyronie's disease by the FDA in 2013.[20] 
Focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy is a non-invasive treatment option which involves passing acoustic pulses through the plaque, which can break it down over a series of six to twelve sessions.[22][23] The treatment is most effective in men with mild to moderate Peyronie's. 
Surgery, such as the "Nesbit operation" (which is named after Reed M. Nesbit (1898–1979), an American urologist at University of Michigan),[8] is considered a last resort and should only be performed by highly skilled urological surgeons knowledgeable in specialized corrective surgical techniques. A penile implant may be appropriate in advanced cases.[24] 
It is estimated to affect about 10% of men.[1] The condition becomes more common with age.[2] The mean age at onset of disease is 55–60 years.[2] 
The condition was first described in 1561 in correspondence between Andreas Vesalius and Gabriele Falloppio and separately by Gabriele Falloppio.[25][26] The condition is named for François Gigot de la Peyronie, who described it in 1743.[27] 
A certain degree of curvature of the penis is considered normal, as many men are born with this benign condition, commonly referred to as congenital curvature.[4] The disease may cause pain; hardened, big, cord-like lesions (scar tissue known as "plaques"); or abnormal curvature of the penis when erect due to chronic inflammation of the tunica albuginea (CITA).[5] 
Penile injury Circumcision Penile fracture Priapism Phimosis Peyronie's disease Sexually transmitted infections Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome 
Priapus, a minor Greek god of fertility, is marked by his oversized, permanent erection, which gave rise to the medical term priapism. Some researchers believe the depiction of Priapus' penis referred to a penile disease, and that paintings of Priapus were used to ward off the disease.[citation needed] 
Penile Artery Shunt Syndrome (PASS) is an iatrogenic clinical phenomenon first described by Tariq Hakky, Christopher Yang, Jonathan Pavlinec, Kamal Massis, and Rafael Carrion within the Sexual Medicine Program in the Department of Urology, at the University of South Florida, and Ricardo Munarriz, of Boston University School of Medicine Department of Urology in 2013. It may be a cause of refractory Erectile Dysfunction in patients who have undergone Penile Revascularization Surgery. 
Percutaneous Coil Embolization of the aberrant obturator artery was performed. Arterial flow rapidly improved through the left dorsal penile artery, and brisk opacification was seen through to the glans penis. Post-procedure, the patient experienced an immediate improvement in erectile function. 
Penile Revascularization is a specialized vascular-surgical treatment option for Erectile Dysfunction. The 2009 International Consultation on Sexual Dysfunctions recommended that revascularization be limited to nonsmoker, nondiabetic men younger than 55 years of age with isolated stenosis of the internal pudendal artery with absence of venous leak.[1] Patients with persistent erectile dysfunction after revascularization may benefit from repeat penile duplex ultrasound and pelvic angiography to evaluate the status of the bypass graft and to exclude the presence of a PASS as the cause. 
The prevalence of an aberrant obturator artery arising from the inferior epigastric artery is approximately 10.5%.[2] If an aberrant obturator artery is visualized arising from the inferior epigastric artery prior to surgical penile revascularization, consideration should be given toward using an alternative source artery or to embolization to avoid the creation of a Penile Artery Shunt Syndrome encountered in this described case. 
Penile Artery Shunt Syndrome (PASS) was initially described in a patient who underwent Penile Revascularization Surgery for isolated left cavernosal artery stenosis in the absence of systemic vascular risk factors. An end-to-end anastomosis of the left inferior epigastric artery to the left dorsal penile artery was created using a previously described technique.[3] After technically successful revascularization surgery, the patient continued to have post-operative erectile dysfunction despite documented patency of the surgical graft by Penile Duplex Ultrasonography. 
Pelvic angiography was performed on the patient, revealing an aberrant obturator artery originating from the inferior epigastric artery. The study revealed markedly sluggish forward flow visualized through the anastomosis to the left dorsal penile artery, with dominant flow in the left inferior epigastric artery to the obturator artery and its branches. This culminated in reduced blood flow to the penis. 
Foreskin restoration is the process of expanding the skin on the penis to reconstruct an organ similar to the foreskin, which has been removed by circumcision or injury. Foreskin restoration is primarily accomplished by stretching the residual skin of the penis, but surgical methods also exist. Restoration creates a facsimile of the foreskin, but specialized tissues removed during circumcision cannot be reclaimed. 
Actual regeneration of the foreskin is experimental at this time. Some forms of restoration involve only partial regeneration in instances of a high-cut wherein the circumcisee feels that the circumciser removed too much skin and that there is not enough skin for erections to be comfortable.[1] 
During restoration via tissue expansion, the remaining penile skin is pulled forward over the glans, and tension is maintained either manually or through the aid of a foreskin restoration device.[citation needed] 
Manual methods are often used by men first starting restoration, but can be used at any stage of the restoration process, and refer to the necessity of the restorer to manually maintain the tension by holding the skin tautly with his fingers using one of several variations in finger placement.[9][10] 
Many specialized foreskin restoration devices that grip the skin with or without tape are also commercially available. Tension from these devices may be applied by weights, elastic straps, or inflation as a means to either push the skin forward on the penis, or by a combination of these methods. 
An example of a device using elastic straps is the T-Tape method,[11] which was developed in the 1990s with the idea of enabling restoration to take place more rapidly.[citation needed] 
Inflation methods involve sealing off the area between the glans and the skin pulled over it using a clamping device (commonly baby bottle nipples are used), and either inflating the skin or a balloon placed under the skin.[citation needed] 
The amount of tension produced by any method must be adjusted to avoid causing injury, pain, or discomfort, and provides a limit on the rate at which new skin can be grown. 
There is a risk of seriously damaging tissues through the use of excessive tension or applying tension for too long. Websites about foreskin restoration vary in their recommendations, from suggesting a regimen of moderate amounts of tension applied for several hours a day,[12] to recommending periods of higher tension applied for only a few minutes per day, as with manual techniques.[13][14] 
Instead of growing new skin or until enough skin has been grown through tissue expansion, some men may opt to use a retaining device to hold remaining skin, if available, over the glans in a manner similar to the ancient Greek kynodesme. Since the glans is an internal membrane, originally protected by the foreskin until it is removed during circumcision, the goal of retaining methods is to replicate a protective covering for the glans.[citation needed] 
If an insufficient amount of skin exists to retain glans coverage with remaining penile skin, one may use a commercially available artificial glans covering. Examples of such artificial coverings include a prosthetic foreskin made of latex that covers the glans in a moist environment,[15] and an undergarment that wraps the penis in a double-layered soft fabric "hood" to minimize friction on the glans.[16] 
Surgical methods of foreskin restoration, known as foreskin reconstruction, usually involve a method of grafting skin onto the distal portion of the penile shaft. The grafted skin is typically taken from the scrotum, which contains the same smooth muscle (known as dartos fascia) as does the skin of the penis. 
One method involves a four-stage procedure in which the penile shaft is buried in the scrotum for a period of time.[17] Such techniques are costly, and have the potential to produce unsatisfactory results or serious complications related to the skin graft.[citation needed] The frenulum can also be reconstructed.[18] 
British Columbia resident Paul Tinari was held down and circumcised at the age of eight in what he stated was "a routine form of punishment" for masturbation at residential schools. Following a lawsuit Tinari's surgical foreskin restoration was covered by the British Columbia Ministry of Health. The plastic surgeon who performed the restoration was the first in Canada to have done such an operation, and used a technique similar to that described above.[19][20] 
There has been growing interest in regenerative medicine as a means to regenerate the human male foreskin. This option, unlike foreskin restoration, would result in a true human male foreskin being regrown. Pioneers in the field of regenerative medicine include Dr. Anthony Atala of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine (WFIRM).[21] 
In early 2010, Foregen, an Italian non-profit lobbying organization dedicated to finding interested research groups for the purposes of regrowing the human male foreskin using the regenerative capabilities of the extracellular matrix, in the hopes of eventually being able to provide regeneration to circumcised men, was founded. Unable to do so, Foregen transitioned to a non-profit, dependent upon charitable donations to accomplish its research, with its own facilities. 
A clinical trial had been scheduled for late 2010, before it transitioned into its own research organization, but there were insufficient donations to follow through.[22] The goal was reached in June 2012 and they managed to obtain a laboratory and cooperation from biochemists and regenerative medicine experts. Results from their first clinical trial, decellurizing bull foreskins to create the extracellular matrix, were released in February 2013 and as of March 2018, had completed trials on cadaver human foreskins, which was published in 2017, and was in the process of peer review as of 2018.[23] Clinical trials on human subjects might be achieved by the end of 2021.[24] 
The penile skin would be opened at the circumcision scar, while the scar tissue is surgically debrided. A biomedical solution would then be applied to both ends of the wound, causing the foreskin to regenerate with the DNA in the patient's own cells. A biodegradable scaffold (i.e., the de-cellularized foreskin of a cadaver)[25] would be used to offer support for the regenerating foreskin.[26] While social forums have assisted in the discussion of current tools and hurdles towards this method,[27] 
In the Greco-Roman world intact genitals, including the foreskin, were considered a sign of beauty, civility, and masculinity.[2] In Classical Greek and Roman societies (8th century BC to 6th century AD), exposure of the glans was considered disgusting and improper, and did not conform to the Hellenistic ideal of gymnastic nudity.[2] Men with short foreskins would wear the kynodesme to prevent exposure.[3] As a consequence of this social stigma, an early form of foreskin restoration known as epispasm was practiced among some Jews in Ancient Rome (8th century BC to 5th century AD).[4] 
Foreskin regeneration along with laboratory-grown penises (regeneration of the entire penis) could be possible soon. In 2014, it was announced that it might be possible five years from the initial announcement.[28] It is unclear whether or not having a restored foreskin with full coverage of the glans could interfere with fitting a foreskin scaffold on the penis and subsequent regeneration.[29] 
The amount of time required to restore a foreskin using non-surgical methods depends on the amount of skin present at the start of the process, the subject's degree of commitment, the techniques used, the body's natural degree of plasticity, and the length of foreskin the individual desires.[citation needed] 
The results of surgical restoration are immediate, but often described as unsatisfactory and most restoration groups advise against surgery.[citation needed] 
Restoration creates a facsimile of the prepuce, but specialized tissues removed during circumcision cannot be reclaimed.[medical citation needed] Surgical procedures exist to reduce the size of the opening once restoration is complete (as depicted in the image above),[30] or it can be alleviated through a longer commitment to the skin expansion regime to allow more skin to collect at the tip.[citation needed] 
Foreskin restoration is of ancient origin and dates back to the reign of the Roman Emperor Tiberius (AD 14-37), when surgical means were taken to lengthen the foreskin of individuals born with either a short foreskin that did not cover the glans completely[1] or a completely exposed glans as a result of circumcision.[5] Again, during World War II some European Jews sought foreskin restoration to avoid Nazi persecution.[6] 
The natural foreskin has three principal components, in addition to blood vessels, nerves, and connective tissue: skin, which is exposed exteriorly; mucous membrane, which is the surface in contact with the glans penis when the penis is flaccid; and a band of muscle within the tip of the foreskin. Generally, the skin grows more readily in response to stretching than does the mucous membrane. The ring of muscle which normally holds the foreskin closed is completely removed in the majority of circumcisions and cannot be regrown, so the covering resulting from stretching techniques is usually looser than that of a natural foreskin. 
Such problems include prominent scarring (33%), insufficient penile skin for comfortable erection (27%), erectile curvature from uneven skin loss (16%), and pain and bleeding upon erection/manipulation (17%). The poll also asked about awareness of or involvement in foreskin restoration and included an open comment section. Many respondents and their wives "reported that restoration resolved the unnatural dryness of the circumcised penis, which caused abrasion, pain or bleeding during intercourse, and that restoration offered unique pleasures, which enhanced sexual intimacy."[35] One man reported he had a great loss of sensation in the glans because his foreskin was not present.[36] 
Various groups have been founded since the late 20th century, especially in North America where circumcision has been routinely performed on infants. In 1989, the National Organization of Restoring Men (NORM) was founded as a non-profit support group for men undertaking foreskin restoration. In 1991, the group UNCircumcising Information and Resource Centers (UNCIRC) was formed,[39] which was incorporated into NORM in 1994.[40] NORM chapters have been founded throughout the United States, as well as in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Germany. 
In France, there are two associations about this. 
The "Association contre la Mutilation des Enfants" AME (association against child mutilation), and more recently "Droit au Corps" (right to the body).[41] 
Tissue expansion has long been known to stimulate mitosis, and research shows that regenerated human tissues have the attributes of the original tissue.[8] Unlike conventional skin expansion techniques, however, the process of nonsurgical foreskin restoration may take several years to complete.[citation needed] 
Patients that have undergone a partial penectomy as a result of a penile cancer diagnosis have reported similar sexual outcomes as prior to surgery.[4] Sexual support therapists and specialists are available nationally in the United States and can be accessed through the specialist cancer services.[2] Many surgeons or hospitals will also provide this information post operatively. Local government health services departments may be able to provide advice, names, and contact numbers. 
Cancer, for example, sometimes necessitates removal of part or all of the penis.[1] The amount of penis removed depends on the severity of the cancer. 
Some men have only the tip of their penis removed. For others with more advanced cancer, the entire penis must be removed.[2] 
In rare instances, botched circumcisions have also resulted in full or partial penectomies, as with David Reimer. 
Because of the rarity of cancers which require the partial or total removal of the penis, support from people who have had the penis removed can be difficult to find locally. Website support networks are available.[1] For instance, the American Cancer Society's Cancer Survivors Network website provides information for finding support networks.[3] Phalloplasty is also an option for surgical reconstruction of a penis. 
It differs from castration, which is the removal of the testicles only, although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.[1] The potential medical consequences of emasculation are more extensive than those associated with castration, as the removal of the penis gives rise to a unique series of complications. There is a range of religious, cultural, punitive, and personal reasons why someone may choose to emasculate themselves or another person. Consensual emasculation may be seen as a form of body modification which enhances a recipient's connection with the community or sense of self. 
Emasculation is also used metaphorically to refer to the loss of a man's masculinity. A man is said to be emasculated when he loses, or is deprived of, a characteristic traditionally associated with being a man, such as power or independence. 
There are several different methods of emasculation. 
Both the penis and testicles may be removed simultaneously using a sharp instrument, such as a knife or razor or swords. This method is often used by medical surgeons on transgender women,[2] or elders performing cultural or religious emasculations.[3] Non-crushing vascular clamps may also be used in medical surgery to cut off blood circulation and reduce bleeding.[4] 
Alternatively, the penis and testicles may be removed at different stages in time. 
Medical surgeons use this method when performing surgery on trans women who want their genitals removed over multiple sex reassignment surgeries (male-to-female), rather than in a single sitting.[5] In one reported case, a transgender woman used this method on herself, first removing her testicles and later her penis, as she was unable to obtain appropriate gender affirming surgery in a medical setting.[6] Another instance involved a trans woman with schizophrenia progressively tightening a string around her genitals to cut off blood flow.[7] 
Short term consequences of emasculation include bleeding,[8] and infection.[9] Historically, death was also a potential complication, although the prevalence is disputed.[10] 
Biofiltration is a pollution control technique using a bioreactor containing living material to capture and biologically degrade pollutants. Common uses include processing waste water, capturing harmful chemicals or silt from surface runoff, and microbiotic oxidation of contaminants in air. 
Most biofilters use media such as sand, crushed rock, river gravel, or some form of plastic or ceramic material shaped as small beads and rings.[6] 
Baku (US: /bɑːˈkuː, ˈbɑːkuː/, UK: /bæˈkuː, ˈbækuː/;[6][7] Azerbaijani: Bakı [bɑˈcɯ] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of Azerbaijan, as well as the largest city on the Caspian Sea and of the Caucasus region.[8] Baku is located 28 metres (92 ft) below sea level, which makes it the lowest lying national capital in the world and also the largest city in the world located below sea level. Baku lies on the southern shore of the Absheron Peninsula, alongside the Bay of Baku. At the beginning of 2009, Baku's urban population was estimated at just over two million people.[9] Officially, about 25% of all inhabitants of the country live in Baku's metropolitan area. 
When Zimbabwe returned to Test cricket in 2011, Taibu was selected to play in their one-off Tests against Bangladesh, Pakistan and New Zealand despite making critical remarks of the country's cricket administration.[9] He scored half-centuries in each of the three Tests.[10] 
Taibu became the 5th Zimbabwean to score 3,000 runs during his innings of 53 (74) against Kenya at Eden Gardens, Kolkata during the 2011 World Cup on 20 March 2011. He along with Stuart Matsikenyeri set the record partnership in ODIs for the sixth wicket for Zimbabwe(188)[11] 
On 10 July 2012, Taibu called time on his career aged 29.[1] He said he would only do work for the church. Taibu told Zimeye: “I just feel that my true calling now lies in doing the Lord’s work, and although I am fortunate and proud to have played for my country, the time has come for me to put my entire focus on that part of my life.” 
He scored 1,546 runs in Tests with 57 catches and five stumpings, while making 3,393 runs in ODIs with 114 catches and 33 stumpings.[1] He finishes as Zimbabwe's fourth highest run-scorer in ODIs with the second most dismissals as a wicketkeeper, behind Andy Flower. 
After his retirement Taibu moved to Liverpool, England. 
He joined Hightown St. Mary's Cricket Club in 2016 as a player-coach-development-officer in the second-division of the Liverpool & District Cricket Competition.[12] While writing his autobiography he realised that he would have to return to Zimbabwe. 
In June 2016 he accepted a role as Zimbabwe Cricket's convener of selectors and development officer, with the encouragement of Peter Chingoka. Brendan Taylor and Kyle Jarvis left county deals in September 2017 to play again for Zimbabwe, fruit of Taibu's efforts to entice them back.[13] 
In 2019, Taibu wrote a book titled 'Keeper of Faith', in which he discusses socio-political situation in Zimbabwe, his childhood beatings, perception after witnessing privileged white cricketers and threats by receiving photos of dead bodies.[14] He was an incredible coach 
Tatenda Taibu (born 14 May 1983) is a former Zimbabwean cricketer who captained the Zimbabwe national cricket team. He is a wicket-keeper-batsman. From 6 May 2004 to 5 September 2019, he held the record for being the youngest test captain in history when he captained his team against Sri Lanka until Rashid Khan of Afghanistan claimed the record. 
[1][2] 
In July 2012 Taibu, aged only 29, decided to retire from cricket to focus on his work in church.[3][4] In December 2018, it was reported that he was making a return to cricket.[5] Later the same month, he played first-class cricket for Badureliya Sports Club in the 2018–19 Premier League Tournament in Sri Lanka.[6] 
Taibu made his first-class cricket debut at the age of 16, and his debut for Zimbabwe national team in 2001, aged 18. In 2003, he was appointed vice-captain to Heath Streak on the team's tour of England, and he was appointed national captain in April 2004, making him the youngest Test captain in history then, until Rashid Khan of Afghanistan claimed the record in 2019. Rashid Khan was 8 days younger than Taibu when he captained Afghanishtan against Bangladesh. 
He made his return to the Zimbabwean side in a series against India A in July 2007, registering a century. The following month Zimbabwe hosted South Africa for a three-game ODI series and in the final game Taibu scored a career best 107 not out. It was the first ODI century by a Zimbabwean against South Africa. 
During 2010 Taibu's form continued and he scored 73 against South Africa as Zimbabwe were all out for 268. The South Africans chased down the total comfortably with Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers scoring centuries.[7] 
He scored 98 for his side in ICC World Cup 2011 as their team won by 175 runs against Canada in Nagpur. Taibu played a splendid innings in must-win situation of World Cup.[8] 
Azerbaijani evolved from the Eastern branch of Oghuz Turkic ("Western Turkic")[12] which spread to the Caucasus, in Eastern Europe,[13][14] and northern Iran, in Western Asia, during the medieval Turkic migrations.[15] Persian and Arabic influenced the language, but Arabic words were mainly transmitted through the intermediary of literary Persian.[16] Azerbaijani is, perhaps after Uzbek, the Turkic language upon which Persian and other Iranian languages have exerted the strongest impact—mainly in phonology, syntax, and vocabulary, less in morphology.[17] 
The Turkic language of Azerbaijan gradually supplanted the Iranian languages in what is now northwestern Iran, and a variety of languages of the Caucasus and Iranian languages spoken in the Caucasus, particularly Udi and Old Azeri. By the beginning of the 16th century, it had become the dominant language of the region. 
It was a spoken language in the court of the Safavids, Afsharids and Qajars. 
1900 and 1930, there were several competing approaches to the unification of the national language in what is now the Azerbaijan Republic, popularized by scholars such as Hasan bey Zardabi and Mammad agha Shahtakhtinski. Despite major differences, they all aimed primarily at making it easy for semi-literate masses to read and understand literature. They all criticized the overuse of Persian, Arabic, and European elements in both colloquial and literary language and called for a simpler and more popular style. 
The Russian conquest of Transcaucasia in the 19th century split the language community across two states; the Soviet Union promoted the development of the language but set it back considerably with two successive script changes[18] – from the Persian to Latin and then to the Cyrillic script – while Iranian Azerbaijanis continued to use the Persian script as they always had. Despite the wide use of Azerbaijani in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, it became the official language of Azerbaijan only in 1956.[19] After independence, the Republic of Azerbaijan decided to switch back to a modified Latin script. 
The development of Azerbaijani literature is closely associated with Anatolian Turkish, written in Perso-Arabic script. 
Examples of its detachment date to the 14th century or earlier.[20][21] Kadi Burhan al-Din, Hesenoghlu, and Imadaddin Nasimi helped to establish Azerbaiijani as a literary language in the 14th century through poetry and other works.[21] The ruler and poet Ismail I wrote under the pen name Khatā'ī (which means "sinner" in Persian) during the fifteenth century.[22][23] During the 16th century, the poet, writer and thinker Fuzûlî wrote mainly in Azerbaijani but also translated his poems into Arabic and Persian.[22] 
Mohammad-Hossein Shahriar is an important figure in Azerbaijani poetry. 
His most important work is Heydar Babaya Salam and it is considered to be a pinnacle of Azerbaijani literature and gained popularity in the Turkic-speaking world. It was translated into more than 30 languages.[24] 
In the mid-19th century, Azerbaijani literature was taught at schools in Baku, Ganja, Shaki, Tbilisi, and Yerevan. Since 1845, it has also been taught in the Saint Petersburg State University in Russia. In 2018, Azerbaijani language and literature programs are offered in the United States at several universities, including Indiana University, UCLA, and University of Texas at Austin.[1] The vast majority, if not all Azerbaijani language courses teach North Azerbaijani written in the Latin script and not South Azerbaijani written in the Perso-Arabic script. 
Azerbaijani (/ˌæzərbaɪˈdʒæni, -ɑːni/) or Azeri (/æˈzɛəri, ɑː-, ə-/), also referred to as Azeri Turkic or Azeri Turkish, is a Turkic language spoken primarily by the Azerbaijani people, who live mainly in the Republic of Azerbaijan where the North Azerbaijani variety is spoken, and in the Azerbaijan region of Iran, where the South Azerbaijani variety is spoken.[lower-alpha 2] Although there is a very high degree of mutual intelligibility between both forms of Azerbaijani, there are significant differences in phonology, lexicon, morphology, syntax and sources of loanwords. 
The standardized form of North Azerbaijani (spoken in the Republic of Azerbaijan and Russia) is based on the Shirvani dialect, while Iranian Azerbaijani uses the Tabrizi dialect as its prestige variety. Since the Republic of Azerbaijan's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, northern Azerbaijani uses the Latin script. Iranian Azerbaijani on the other hand has always used and continues to use the Perso-Arabic script. 
Historically the language was referred by its native speakers as Türki[6] meaning "Turkic" or Azərbaycan türkcəsi meaning "Azerbaijani Turkish". Prior to the establishment of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, which adopted the name of "Azerbaijan" for political reasons in 1918, the name of "Azerbaijan" was exclusively used to identify the adjacent region of contemporary northwestern Iran.[7][8][9] After the establishment of the Azerbaijan SSR,[10] on the order of Soviet leader Stalin, the "name of the formal language" of the Azerbaijan SSR was "changed from Turkic to Azerbaijani".[10] 
It was started by Hasan bey Zardabi, a journalist and education advocate.[1] Following the rule of the Qajar dynasty, Iran was ruled by Reza Shah who banned the publication of texts in Azerbaijani.[citation needed] Modern literature in the Republic of Azerbaijan is based on the Shirvani dialect mainly, while in Iranian Azerbaijan it is based on the Tabrizi dialect. 
The "Word of Wisdom" is the common name of an 1833 section of the Doctrine and Covenants,[1] a book considered by many churches within the Latter Day Saint movement to consist of revelations from God. It is also the name of a health code based on this scripture, practiced by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and Mormon fundamentalists, and to a lesser extent, some other Latter Day Saint denominations. In the LDS Church, compliance with the Word of Wisdom is currently a prerequisite for baptism, service in full-time missionary work, attendance at church schools, and entry into the church's temples; however, violation of the code is not considered to be grounds for withdrawal of membership or other disciplinary action.[2] 
an introduction;[7] a list of substances that should not be ingested, including wine, strong drink, tobacco and "hot drinks";[8] a list of foods that should be used, some with certain limitations;[9] and a divine promise to those who follow the guidelines.[10] 
Among the substances which the revelation indicates should not be ingested, the first is "wine or strong drink", which the revelation says should not be drunk.[11] (An exception is allowed for the use of "pure wine of your own make" as part of the sacrament ordinance,[12] though the LDS Church today uses water in place of wine.) 
The revelation also advises against the consumption of tobacco[13] and "hot drinks".[14] 
The Word of Wisdom revelation also suggests proper uses for some prohibited substances. While "strong drinks" are not to be ingested, they are appropriate when used "for the washing of your bodies";[15] likewise, while human ingestion of tobacco is forbidden, tobacco is said to be "an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judgment and skill".[2] 
The list of foods and substances which the revelation encourages includes "wholesome herbs [and] every fruit in the season thereof"[16] and "that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground".[17] It also prescribes the use of "all grain", which is described as "the staff of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field".[18] Barley and other grains are recommended for use in making "mild drinks".[19] 
The text discourages "strong drink" and wine (in some cases this includes sacramental wine, which has been replaced with sacramental water in some sects), the non-medicinal use of tobacco, "hot drinks", and meat used more than "sparingly". The scripture also recommends the consumption of herbs, fruits, and grains, as well as grain-based "mild drinks". As practiced by the LDS Church, there is no firm restriction relating to meat consumption, but all alcoholic beverages are forbidden, including beer. 
The LDS Church interprets "hot drinks" to mean coffee and tea.[3] 
The Word of Wisdom states that it comprises a "principle with promise".[21] The promise given to those who followed the advice of the word of wisdom is as follows: 
And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; and shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures; and shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them.[1] 
Although it was first only a recommendation, it was made a commandment later on. 
This gave the saints time to adjust to the new principles. Originally, abiding by the recommendations and prohibitions of the Word of Wisdom was not considered mandatory: it explicitly declares itself to be "not by commandment or constraint".[22] In February 1834, however, Joseph Smith proposed a resolution before the high council of the church that stated, "No official member in this Church is worthy to hold an office after having the word of wisdom properly taught him; and he, the official member, neglecting to comply with and obey it."[23][24][25] This resolution was accepted unanimously by the council.[23] 
I understand that some of the people are excusing themselves in using tea and coffee, because the Lord only said "hot drinks" in the revelation of the Word of Wisdom .... 
Tea and coffee ... are what the Lord meant when He said "hot drinks".[27][28] 
The charge of "not observing the Word of Wisdom" was one of five leveled against David Whitmer on April 13, 1838, which led to his excommunication.[29] Nevertheless, contemporary records indicate that Joseph Smith was not, himself, a strict observer. 
Smith is recorded at various times as drinking tea,[30] beer,[31] and wine.[32] There is a report he also smoked tobacco: according to Amasa Lyman, a member of the First Presidency under Smith, Smith once finished preaching a sermon on the Word of Wisdom and immediately afterward rode through the streets smoking a cigar.[33] According to Lyman, this was just one of many instances in which Smith "tried the faith of the Saints ... by his peculiarities". 
(One modern commentator has suggested that this may have been done by Smith to ensure that his followers' faith was based on the Latter Day Saint religion and not on Smith's personality or leadership.)[34] 
On August 19, 1835, Almon W. Babbitt was brought before the church's high council on three charges. On the charge of "not keeping the Word of Wisdom", Babbitt stated "that he had taken the liberty to break the Word of Wisdom, from the example of President Joseph Smith, Jun., and others, but acknowledged that it was wrong."[35] 
After Smith's death, several factions emerged from the Latter Day Saint movement. The largest of these groups, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), was led by Brigham Young. At a general conference of the church held on September 9, 1851, Young called on the attendees to "leave off the use of" items mentioned in the Word of Wisdom: 
Though Young encouraged Mormons to follow the Word of Wisdom code, the church was tolerant of those who did not follow it. In 1860, he counseled those chewing tobacco in church meetings to at least be discreet and not excessive, but did not charge users with sin.[38] By 1870, however, he ended the practice of chewing and spitting tobacco in the Salt Lake Tabernacle.[39] 
The Word of Wisdom states that "flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air ... are to be used sparingly", and that "it is pleasing unto [God] that they should not be used, only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine."[42] Unlike the injunctions against tobacco, alcohol, and hot drinks, however, compliance with this injunction has never been made mandatory. 
In 1868, church president Brigham Young counseled, "Flesh should be used sparingly, in famine and in cold."[43] In 1868, apostle George Q. Cannon said, "We are told that flesh of any kind is not suitable to man in the summer time, and ought to be eaten sparingly in the winter."[44] From 1897 to 1901, apostle and then church president Lorenzo Snow repeatedly emphasized the importance of eating meat sparingly, teaching that church members should refrain from eating meat except in case of dire necessity, and that this should be seen in light of Smith's teaching that animals have spirits.[3] In 1895, Snow stated, "Unless famine or extreme cold is upon us we should refrain from the use of meat."[46] Apostle George Teasdale taught the same thing, and held that eating pork was a more serious breach of the Word of Wisdom than drinking tea or coffee.[45] When Joseph F. Smith succeeded Snow as president of the church in 1901, he preached regularly against the "unnecessary destruction of life", and emphasized kindness to animals and the important stewardship humans have toward them .[47] 
Despite these statements, restricting meat consumption was not made an explicit requirement for worthiness in the LDS Church as the standards for obedience to the Word of Wisdom were made increasingly central to LDS Church doctrine and practice in the early 20th century.[48] The increased emphasis on the Word of Wisdom took place during the presidency of Heber J. Grant, a long-time enthusiastic promoter of the Word of Wisdom. 
Although Grant did not make restricting meat consumption an explicit part of the standard, he continued to interpret it as part of the counsel in the Word of Wisdom. In the 1937 General Conference, at 80 years old, Grant said he worked long hours "without fatigue and without feeling the least injury". He attributed his excellent health, in part, to eating very little meat.[49] 
Since Grant's presidency, the emphasis on limiting the consumption of meat has lessened, but there have been some church leaders who have taught on the subject. 
In a 1948 LDS general conference address, apostle Joseph F. Merrill emphasized the importance of not eating meat as "freely as many Americans are doing".[50] In 1950, apostle and plant scientist John A. Widtsoe wrote, in relation to meat consumption, "they who wish to be well and gain the promised reward stated in the Word of Wisdom must obey all of the law, not just part of it as suits their whim or their appetite, or their notion of its meaning."[51] As recently as 2012, official church spokesperson Michael Otterson stated "the church has also encouraged limiting meat consumption in favor of grains, fruits and vegetables.[52] To this day, the LDS Church's hymnal includes a hymn with the following lyrics: 
This verse has caused some to ask if meat should be eaten in the summer. Meat has more calories than fruits and vegetables, which some individuals may need fewer of in summer than winter. 
Also, before fruits and vegetables could be preserved, people often did not have enough other food to eat in winter. Spoiled meat can be fatal if eaten, and in former times meat spoiled more readily in summer than winter. Modern methods of refrigeration now make it possible to preserve meat in any season. 
The key word with respect to the use of meat is sparingly.[54] 
All grain is good for the food of man; as also the fruit of the vine; that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground— 17. 
Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn for the ox, and oats for the horse, and rye for the fowls and for swine, and for all beasts of the field, and barley for all useful animals, and for mild drinks, as also other grain.[55] 
According to Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, the Word of Wisdom was received in 1833 as a revelation from God. After Smith's death, Brigham Young stated that the revelation was given in response to problems encountered while conducting meetings in the Smith family home:[4] 
The revelation suggests that barley-based mild drinks (such as beer) may be permissible.[1] As recently as 1901, apostles Brigham Young, Jr. and John Henry Smith argued that the revelation did not prohibit beer.[45] However, LDS Church leaders now teach that consumption of any form of alcohol, including beer, violates the Word of Wisdom.[56][57][58] 
In a pamphlet written in 1930 called The Word of Wisdom, apostle John A. Widtsoe taught that refined flour was contrary to the Word of Wisdom.[1] The church, however, has never prohibited the use of refined flour. 
Adherence to the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom was not made a requirement for entry into LDS Church temples until 1902. However, even then, church president Joseph F. Smith encouraged stake presidents to be liberal with old men who used tobacco and old ladies who drank tea.[1] Of those who violated the revelation, it was mainly habitual drunkards that were excluded from the temple.[45] Around the turn of the century, the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom were not strictly adhered to by such notable church leaders. 
Anthon H. Lund, a First Counselor in the First Presidency, drank beer and wine; apostle Matthias F. Cowley drank beer and wine; Charles W. Penrose, who also served as a First Counselor in the First Presidency, drank wine; Relief Society general president Emmeline B. Wells drank coffee; and church president George Albert Smith drank brandy for medicinal purposes.[45] In 1921, church president Heber J. Grant made adherence to the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom an absolute requirement for entering the temple.[45] 
Today, adherence to the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom is required for baptism[59] and for entry into temples of the LDS Church.[60] BYU historian Thomas G. Alexander points out that while the original Word of Wisdom as a "principle with promise" was given by revelation, there is no evidence that any church leader has claimed a separate new revelation, or even a spiritual confirmation, of changing the Word of Wisdom from "a principle with promise" to a commandment.[3] 
The only official interpretation of "hot drinks" (D&C 89:9) in the Word of Wisdom is the statement made by early Church leaders that the term "hot drinks" means tea and coffee. 
Members should not use any substance that contains illegal drugs. Nor should members use harmful or habit-forming substances except under the care of a competent physician.[61] 
When they assembled together in this room after breakfast, the first they did was to light their pipes, and, while smoking, talk about the great things of the kingdom, and spit all over the room, and as soon as the pipe was out of their mouths a large chew of tobacco would then be taken. Often when the Prophet [Joseph Smith] entered the room to give the school instructions he would find himself in a cloud of tobacco smoke. This, and the complaints of his wife at having to clean so filthy a floor, made the Prophet think upon the matter, and he inquired of the Lord relating to the conduct of the Elders in using tobacco, and the revelation known as the Word of Wisdom was the result of his inquiry.[5] 
LDS Church leaders have counseled church members that they should not have personal interpretations of, or become extreme in their observance of the Word of Wisdom. One church leader specifically warned that adding additional unauthorized requirements, emphasizing it with excess zeal, or making it a "gospel hobby" is a sign of spiritual immaturity and sometimes apostasy.[62] 
Popular application 
A 2019 study of attitudes among Mormons within the U.S. said that a quarter to a half of such individuals interpret the Word of Wisdom in variance with the official interpretation by the LDS Church in some manner.[63] 
Generally, members of the LDS Church view the prohibition on "hot drinks" as covering coffee and tea, whether or not the drinks are hot.[1] There is generally thought to be no prohibition against drinking hot water,[65] herbal tea, hot chocolate, coffee substitutes such as Postum or malt drinks such as Ovaltine or Milo. Other members choose to prohibit themselves from drinking any beverage that contains caffeine.[64] 
A longstanding issue among members of the LDS Church is whether it is permissible to ingest drinks containing caffeine that are not coffee or tea. In 1918, Frederick J. Pack, a Mormon professor at the University of Utah, published an article in an official church magazine in which he reasoned that because Coca-Cola contained caffeine, which is also present in tea and coffee, Mormons should abstain from Coca-Cola in the same way that they abstain from the Word of Wisdom "hot drinks".[66] Since Pack's article, many Mormons have come to believe that the reason tea and coffee are proscribed is the presence of caffeine in the drinks. 
However, the church has never stated that this is the reason for the prohibition. 
The church does not have an official position on the consumption of caffeinated beverages, apart from the general statement that the Word of Wisdom does not specifically mention it. In 2012, in response to a report on Mormonism on NBC’s Rock Center with Brian Williams, which claimed that LDS faithful were prohibited from drinking caffeine, the church wrote: 
The Word of Wisdom was first published as a stand-alone broadsheet in December 1833. In 1835, it was included as Section LXXX[6] in the first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. 
Despite what was reported, the Church revelation spelling out health practices (Doctrine and Covenants 89) does not mention the use of caffeine. The Church’s health guidelines prohibits alcoholic drinks, smoking or chewing of tobacco, and "hot drinks"—taught by Church leaders to refer specifically to tea and coffee.[67] 
In the past, a number of church leaders have discouraged the use of such products. For example, in 1922, church president Heber J. Grant counseled the Latter-day Saints: 
I am not going to give any command, but I will ask it as a personal, individual favor to me, to let coca-cola [sic] alone. There are plenty of other things you can get at the soda fountains without drinking that which is injurious. The Lord does not want you to use any drug that creates an appetite for itself.[68] 
Two years after making this statement, Grant met with a representative of The Coca-Cola Company to discuss the church's position on Coca-Cola; at the conclusion of their second meeting, Grant stated that he was "sure I have not the slightest desire to recommend that the people leave Coca-Cola alone if th[e] amount [of caffeine in Coca-Cola] is absolutely harmless, which they claim it is."[1] Grant never again spoke out against the use of cola drinks. 
With reference to cola drinks, the Church has never officially taken a position on this matter, but the leaders of the Church have advised, and we do now specifically advise, against the use of any drink containing harmful habit-forming drugs under circumstances that would result in acquiring the habit. Any beverage that contains ingredients harmful to the body should be avoided.[69]

Zainunnisa "Cissie" Gool (6 November 1897 – 1 July 1963) was an anti-apartheid political and civil rights leader in South Africa. 
She was the daughter of prominent physician and politician Abdullah Abdurahman and mother Helen Potter James. 
Gool founded the National Liberation League and helped to create the Non-European United Front (NEUF). 
She was known and loved as the "Jewel of District Six" and "Joan of Arc" by South Africans as a champion of the poor.[1] 
Zainunnisa Gool was born on 6 November 1897 to Abdullah Abdurahman, leader of the African Peoples Organisation (APO) which he had helped to form in 1902 and was also the first black South African to be elected to the Cape Town City Council in 1904,[2] and Helen Potter James.[2] 
Gool came from a radical background and she was tutored by both Olive Schreiner and Mahatma Gandhi. 
Gool and her sister, Rosie, attended the Trafalgar High School in District Six in Cape Town[3] which had been founded by her father, an advocate of equality in public education. 
The head of the school was Harold Cressy who was championed by her father. 
She finished her secondary school education by a correspondence course at London University. 
With this qualification, Gool enrolled to become the first coloured woman to receive a master's degree from the University of Cape Town and in 1962, she became the first coloured female law graduate in South Africa and the first to be called to the Cape Bar.[2] 
From 1938 to 1951, Cissie represented Cape Town's District Six on the Cape Town City Council, and for several years was the only woman (and the first black woman) serving on the City Council. 
In 1949, she was elected chairperson of the city council's health committee,[1] the first black woman in the country to serve in local government.[citation needed] Known as the "Jewel of District Six" she represented the people of that constituency in the council until her death in 1963, despite having been named as a Communist under the Suppression of Communism Act.[4] 
Annie Silinga was a South African anti-pass laws and anti-apartheid political activist. 
She is known for her role as the Cape Town African National Congress Women's League President, a leader in the 1956 anti-pass Women's March to the Union Buildings in Pretoria, South Africa and the only African woman in the 1956 treason trial in South Africa.[1] 
Defiance Campaign Women's March (South Africa) 
60 Iconic Women — The people behind the 1956 Women's March to Pretoria 
Annie Silinga was born in 1910 at Nqqamakwe in the Butterworth district of the Transkei, now known as the Eastern Cape, where she only completed a few years of primary school. 
Silinga grew up in Transkei during a time of prosperity, when the land allowed farming and cattle could graze freely. 
However, over population led to soil erosion and overgrazing causing poverty in the area. 
By 1937, conditions had deteriorated to the point where Silinga was desperate to move. 
Her "babies," she said, "had been dying in the Transkei."[2] In 1937, when she was 27, Silinga moved to Cape Town where her husband Matthew had just gained employment, hoping for better medical facilities. 
In Cape Town, for the first time, Silinga, her husband and their five children could live together as a family. 
At his previous job in the mines of Johannesburg, accommodation was not provided for the families of the mineworkers and regulations forbade women from staying there for extended periods. 
After World War II, Silinga and her husband moved to Langa township. 
Although Silinga was arrested numerous times, she and her family remained in Langa where she died in 1984.[2] 
After moving to Langa, after World War II, Silinga began attending meetings at which measures to improve conditions for the community were discussed. 
In 1948, aged 38, she joined the Langa Vigilance Association (LVA). 
LVA sought to fight for the improvement of living conditions in Langa and protect the residents from apartheid laws. 
In 1952, she joined the ANC, she joined the African National Congress (ANC). 
Soon after joining the ANC, she took part in the anti-pass laws in the movement's 1952 Defiance Campaign where she was arrested and served a brief jail term for civil disobedience. 
She served the jail sentence with her six month old baby.[2][3] 
In 1953, Silinga, then a member of the ANC Women's League (ANCWL), was part of the core group that organised the first meeting of the Federation of South African Women (FSAW), to harness the outrage of women against the pass law issue. 
The group was led by Ray Alexander, communist and trade unionist, and included Gladys Smith of the Cape Housewives' League, Katie White of the Women's Food Committee, and Dora Tamanda of the ANCWL and the Communist Party of South Africa. 
At the first conference, held in Johannesburg in April 1954, Silinga was elected as part of the FEDSAW National Executive Committee[2] It was also at this meeting that the Women’s Charter was written by women from different races. 
In 1954, during a FEDSAW meeting at the Cape Town Parade, Silinga declared: “I will never carry a pass, I will only carry one similar to Mrs (Susan) Strijdom’s. 
She is a woman and I am too. 
There is no difference.” [4] After breaking the pass law and a few unsuccessful appeals, she was banished to Transkei in 1956. 
She returned illegally to be with her children and husband in Langa. 
In 1957, Silinga appealed her case successfully on the grounds that more than 15 years’ residence in Cape Town entitled her to remain there.[1] 
On 9 August 1956, Silinga led 20 000 women organised by FEDSAW who marched to the prime minister's office in Pretoria to protest the issuing of passes. 
Silinga was arrested alongside other FEDSAW leaders Lilian Ngoyi and Helen Joseph, as well as ANC leaders Oliver Tambo and Nelson Mandela. 
The apartheid government charged Silinga and other activists with treason. 
The initial phase of the Treason Trial lasted until December 1957, when the state dropped charges against 61 of the defendants. 
Silinga was one of those released. 
In 1958, Silinga was elected as the president of the Cape Town ANCWL in 1958.[2] In 1960 anti-pass law riots happened in Langa and Sharpeville. 
The apartheid government declared a state of emergency and Silinga was one of the people arrested. 
The ANC was banned as a political organisation in 1960. 
Upon her return from prison, she was involved in the formation of the Women’s Front, and was made a patron of the United Democratic Front in 1983. 
Silinga lived in Langa all her life and died without having carried a pass in 1984. 
Although she was buried in an unmarked pauper's grave, artist Sue Williamson, at the request of Annie Silinga’s family, created a piece to place at her grave in Langa cemetery. 
It bears Silinga's battle cry: "I will never carry a pass!" [1] 
Silinga is remembered as one of the leaders in the anti-pass campaign during apartheid South Africa. 
Besides political work, Silinga is remembered for her selfless character, having started a creche along Winnie Seqwana in Langa Township.[5] A street in Phillipi, Cape Town is named after Annie Silinga. 
In baseball, a stolen base occurs when a runner advances to a base to which he is not entitled and the official scorer rules that the advance should be credited to the action of the runner. The umpires determine whether the runner is safe or out at the next base, but the official scorer rules on the question of credit or blame for the advance under Rule 10 (Rules of Scoring) of the MLB's Official Rules.[1] 
A stolen base most often occurs when a base runner advances to the next base while the pitcher is pitching the ball to home plate. 
In baseball statistics, stolen bases are denoted by SB. Attempts to steal that result in the baserunner being out are caught stealing (CS). 
The sum of these statistics is steal attempts. Successful steals as a percentage of total steal attempts is called the success rate. 
Ned Cuthbert, playing for the Philadelphia Keystones in either 1863 or 1865, was the first player to steal a base in a baseball game, although the term stolen base was not used until 1870.[2] For a time in the 19th century, stolen bases were credited when a baserunner reached an extra base on a base hit from another player.[3] For example, if a runner on first base reached third base on a single, it counted as a steal. In 1887, Hugh Nicol set a still-standing Major League record with 138 stolen bases,[4] many of which would not have counted under modern rules.[3] Modern steal rules were fully implemented in 1898.[5]

The Suid-Afrikaanse Nasionale Trust en Assuransie Maatskappij Beperk (South African National Trust and Assurance Company Limited), Santam, was registered on 28 March 1918. It was then decided to convert the life assurance department into a separate company, and the Suid-Afrikaanse Nasionale Lewens Assuransie Maatskappij Beperk (South African National Life Assurance Company Limited), Sanlam, was registered on 8 June 1918. Sanlam, the subsidiary, later became the spearhead of the operation, while Santam remained focused on short-term insurance. 
Over the years, Sanlam's focus gradually shifted from traditional life insurance to providing a broader range of financial products and services. In 1998 Sanlam demutualised, listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) Ltd and the Namibian Stock Exchange. This changed Sanlam from a mutual entity into a public company with a share capital, namely Sanlam Life Insurance Ltd.

In November 2018, Ozow was invited to the PASA EPC Risk Subcommittee meeting, chaired by Vinu Thomas, to discuss appropriate standards that could be enacted by PASA and the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) in order to mitigate against the risks associated with screen scraping.[19] 
PASA had identified Ozow as an automated EFT service provider with whom PASA could engage with in order to devise best practices in this regard. PASA’s view was that PCI DSS standards could be used as a base for security standards for institutions that engaged in screen scraping, with additional EFT-specific enhancements (which would be known as PCI DSS+).[20] 
Established in 2014 Ozow has headquarters in Johannesburg and Cape Town, South Africa.[4] The company launched end of 2016.

Naspers Limited is a South African multinational holding company headquartered in Cape Town, with interests in publishing, online retail and venture capital investing in the consumer internet sector. Naspers' principal shareholder is its Dutch listed subsidiary Prosus, which owns approximately 49% of its parent as part of a cross ownership structure.[5] 
Founded in 1915 by attorney W. A. Hofmeyr, Naspers was the largest publishing company in South Africa throughout the 20th century with interests across newspapers, magazines and books. In the 1980s the company began to diversify, launching a subscription television service and investing in markets outside of South Africa for the first time. 
In 2001, Naspers made an early investment in Chinese technology firm Tencent and became increasingly focused on the global consumer internet sector. In 2019, Naspers listed its global internet investment business unit Prosus (including a 31% stake in Tencent) on Euronext Amsterdam. 
Naspers currently owns a 56.92% stake in Prosus[1] and wholly owns Media24 (Africa's largest publishing company), Takealot.com (South Africa's largest online retailer) and Naspers Foundry, a South African focused venture capital fund. 
In 1914, a group of prominent Cape Afrikaners decided at a meeting in Stellenbosch to form a publishing company that would support Afrikaner nationalism[6] in the Union of South Africa.[7] This meeting lead to W. A. Hofmeyr, a well-known Cape lawyer and National Party organizer; founding De Nasionale Pers Beperkt (National Press Ltd) in 1915 as a publisher of newspapers and magazines.[8][9] The firm's name was commonly shortened to Naspers (De Nasionale Pers Beperk), the contraction eventually becoming used even by the company itself. 
Naspers launched with the support of Jannie Marais, a prominent Stellenbosch farmer,[1] Jan Christiaan Smuts, Louis Botha, and National Party founding president J.B.M. Hertzog. Naspers was strongly supportive of the National Party[10][11] and began publishing the Afrikaans language daily De Burger (later renamed Die Burger) in June 1915, followed by its first magazine, De Huisgenoot (later Die Huisgenoot) in 1916.[12] 
In March 2021, Swiggy set up Health Hub across Chennai, Tamil Nadu.[18]

The first was a $2 million investment from Accel and SAIF Partners, along with additional investment from Norwest Venture Partners.[1] The next year, Swiggy raised $15 million from new and existing investors, including Bessemer Venture Partners and Harmony Partners.[14] 
In 2017, Naspers led an $80 million funding round into Swiggy.[1] Swiggy received $100 million from China-based Meituan-Dianping and Naspers in 2018 and a string of investments boosted the company's valuation to over a $1 billion.[14] 
In February 2019, Swiggy acquired Bangalore-based AI startup Kint.io.[20] 
In April 2020, Swiggy received around $43 million funding which valued the company at $3.6 billion.[21]

31 crore in Mumbai-based ready-to-eat food brand Fingerlix.[27] 
The company raised $800 million in Series J round funding from Falcon Edge Capital, Goldman Sachs, Think Capital, Amansa Capital, and Carmignac, as well as the existing investors Prosus Ventures and Accel valuing Swiggy at around $4.9 billion.[28] 
Swiggy is India's largest[4][5][6] online food ordering and delivery platform, founded in July 2014. 
Swiggy is based in Bangalore, India, and as of September 2021, is operating in 500 Indian cities.[7][8] In early 2019, Swiggy expanded into general product deliveries under the name Swiggy Stores.[9][10][5]

In 2013, the two founders, Nandan Reddy and Sriharsha Majety, designed an e-commerce website called Bundl to facilitate courier service and shipping within India.[13] Bundl was halted, and was rebranded to enter the food delivery market.[14] At the time, the food delivery sector was in turmoil as several notable startups, such as Foodpanda (later acquired by Ola Cabs), TinyOwl (later acquired by Zomato) and Ola Cafe (later closed) were struggling.[13][14] Majety and Reddy approached Rahul Jaimini, formerly with Myntra, and founded Swiggy and parent holding company Bundl Technologies in 2013.[14] The company built a dedicated delivery network and grew rapidly, primarily driven by the focus on logistics and locking in key resources.[14] 
In May 2020, Swiggy laid off 1100 employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.[15]

Kulula is a wholly owned subsidiary of Comair Ltd,[1] which also operates flights as a franchisee of British Airways. Kulula.com, the British Airways franchise Southern Africa and Comair Ltd suspended operations in July 2020 due to financial issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Both Kulula and the British Airways franchise operated by Comair plans to resume operations by December 2020. 
As of March 2019, Kulula serves the following destinations:[1] 
Comair[10] Kenya Airways[10] KLM[11] 
Boeing 727-200[14] Boeing 737-200[2] McDonnell Douglas MD-82[12] 
Kulula has become known for its distinctive, brightly coloured, and often comedic aircraft liveries.[15] One of its former aircraft, known as Flying 101, was covered with a legend describing the different parts of the aircraft.[16] 
Kulula.com (stylized as kulula.com) and commonly referred to as Kulula is a South African low-cost airline, operating on major domestic routes from O. R. Tambo International Airport and Lanseria International Airport, both serving the city of Johannesburg.[1] The airline's headquarters are located at Bonaero Park, Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni, Gauteng.[2] The name 'Kulula' comes from the Nguni languages of Zulu and Xhosa, meaning It's easy.[lower-alpha 1] 
Kulula operates the Avios frequent-flyer programme, which was created from the merger of the Air Miles, BA Miles and Iberia Plus Points schemes on 16 November 2011. A restructure in 2015 meant that all of IAG's affiliated loyalty programmes which use Avios, including Avios Travel Reward Programme, Iberia Plus and British Airways Executive Club were transferred to Avios Group, an IAG subsidiary.[17][18] 
Kulula offers food and drinks as a buy-on-board programme.[19] The airline's in-flight magazine, khuluma, has a readership base of 200,000 per month. 
Kulula was established in July 2001 and commenced operations as South Africa's first 'no-frills' carrier in August of that year. The stated aim was to position kulula.com as more than just an airline brand, but to include booking, paying and making 'the complete travel experience' affordable.[3] 
In 2010, Kulula was forced by FIFA to stop a campaign describing itself as the "Unofficial National Carrier of the You-Know-What",[4][5] which took place "Not next year, not last year, but somewhere in between",[6] obviously referring to the 2010 FIFA World Cup which took place in South Africa at that time. Another advert announced "affordable flights [to] everybody except Sepp Blatter" (the FIFA president), who was offered a free seat "for the duration of that thing that is happening right now".[7] 
In July 2012 kulula announced[8] that it was operating the first of seven brand new Boeing 737-800s, with three to be in operation before the end of that year, and the remaining four to be delivered in 2015 and 2016. 
Kulula.com and parent company Comair suspended operations towards the end of March 2020 due to financial constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The airline plans to resume operations by December 2020.[9] 
In 2012, Mann was charged with thirteen felony counts of fraud for allegedly defrauding a city beautification program while operating his real estate company MannEdge Properties in 2008 and 2009.[10][11] Prosecutors reduced the sentence to five felony counts in August 2013, and later that year Mann pled no contest to the five counts.[4] He was sentenced to five years of probation and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and restitution.[12] Mann told The New York Times in 2021 that the conviction was later expunged.[5] 
Mann founded video production company Dhar Mann Studios in 2018. 
The studio produces films for social media such as YouTube.[1][14] When Mann started a YouTube channel in 2018, its output comprised motivational videos, and the channel's focus later shifted to morality plays.[15] In 2021, Mann started a contract with the Creative Artists Agency.[14] 
A New York Times profile of Mann described his YouTube videos as "timely narratives about police-calling Karens and Covid-19 hoarders" told in the fashion of "1980s after-school specials and the educational short films of the '50s", noting their often "thin and absolutist" moral philosophy and blatantly clickbait titles.[1] Vulture called them "feel-good" videos intended to "encourage people to be decent to one another."[16] 
In 2014, Mann was in a relationship with businesswoman Lilly Ghalichi, known for participating on the reality television series Shahs of Sunset.[17][18] Mann met his fiancée Laura Avila in 2015. 
Together, the couple manage LiveGlam, a cosmetics company that Mann founded in 2015.[3] The couple had their first child in 2020. Later that year, they purchased a mansion in Calabasas, California previously owned by media personality Khloé Kardashian. [19] In 2021, the couple gave birth to a second child.

Dhar Mann (born May 29, 1984) is an American entrepreneur. Mann founded Dhar Mann Studios, which produces short films for social media such as YouTube, in 2018. 
In 2010, Mann and stock broker Derek Peterson received significant media coverage for founding the weGrow store, which sold hydroponics marketed for growing medical marijuana. weGrow was closed two years later amid lawsuits between the business partners. A year later, in 2013, Mann was charged for allegedly defrauding the city of Oakland, California while running his real estate company MannEdge Properties. 
Dharminder Mann was born May 29, 1984,[1] the son of Surinder and Baljit Singh, who emigrated from India to the United States.[2][3] Mann's parents own Friendly Cab, a taxi cab operator based in Oakland, California.[3][4][5] The East Bay Express reported in 2015 that the Singh family owned an "extensive portfolio of real estate in Oakland".[6] 
Mann recalls growing up in a one-bedroom Bay Area apartment that was shared with three other families. As his parents were focused on managing their company, rather than "give me their time, they gave me money to do things." At the age of nineteen, he started a real estate company, and founded other, often failed, companies within the decade,[1] including ventures in luxury car rental services and mortgage refinancing.[7] 
Mann founded weGrow, a retailer of cannabis-growing hydroponics, with former stock broker Derek Peterson in January 2010. Mann and Peterson rented a supply store in Oakland, California to sell hydroponics equipment, and aimed to open franchises in eight other states.[1][8] 
In early 2011, the weGrow store was closed, with Peterson filing lawsuits against the company citing unpaid debts[1] and accusing Mann of running a "hydroponzi scheme" in an Mother Jones interview.[9] A spokesman for Mann subsequently accused Peterson of fabricating the allegations in retaliation for Mann's decision to downsize their partnership,[9] and Mann successfully countersued Peterson for a cash settlement and stocks in Peterson's own company.[2]

The site has been venerated since the Middle Ages. 
Local women from the Taraz Oasis still pray for children and a happy family. 
It is customary for newlyweds in Taraz to have their union blessed by the dead lovers. 
Their ritual reenacts the myth. 
After the ceremony the wedding party retraces Karakhan's journey from Taraz to the site of his fiancée's death. 
The journey begins at Karakhan Mausoleum in Taraz and ends at the Aisha Bibi, at each location the bride and groom venerate the dead lovers and ask for their blessing. 
The Aisha-Bibi (Kazakh: Айша бибі) is an 11th or 12th-century mausoleum for a noble woman located in the village of Aisha Bibi, 18 km (11 mi) west of Taraz, Kazakhstan on the Silk Road. 
It is locally famous as a monument to love and faithfulness. 
Design 
According to legend, the mausoleum was built by a Karakhanid Dynasty ruler for his beautiful fiancée Aisha-Bibi, a daughter of Sufi poet Khakim-Ata. 
The mausoleum's architectural forms and decoration are reminiscent of fine lace. 
The whole building is covered with carved terracotta tiles using 60 different floral geometric patterns and stylized calligraphy.[1] Aisha Bibi is a direct stylistic descendant of Samanid Mausoleum in Bukhara.[2] 
Aisha Bibi is part of a larger complex. 
Ten meters away is a second mausoleum called Babaji Khatun ("wise queen"), and across the road is a sacred limestone cavern. 
Together with a garden area and parking lot they form the national monument. 
The complex is sited on a ridge overlooking the Taraz oasis from the west. 
The entire mausoleum is covered with terracotta panels which help to create the illusion of masslessness typical in Islamic architecture. 
The terracotta decoration also uses light and shadow rather than color, a pre-Mongol style. 
Functionally, this type of decoration scatters the light so the viewer is not blinded as he might be from a smooth light colored wall in full sun. 
The Columns on the corner are shaped after wooden columns used extensively in Soghdian pre-Islamic architecture. 
There is a band of calligraphy at the point of constriction in each column. 
In general they describe the beauty of Aisha Bibi and of love in general. 
One of the old distichs reads: "Autumn... 
Clouds... 
The Earth is beautiful". 
Sauran clay was used to make the bricks in both the original and restored Aisha Bibi.[3] 
History 
Mausoleum of Bibi Khanum adjacent to Aisha Bibi 
The 16-year-old beauty, Aisha-bibi, was just an hour away from meeting her lover. 
She was in love with the Emir of Taraz and wanted to marry him, against the wishes of her father, so, she left her home Otrar with her wet nurse. 
Towards the end of their journey, the two women stopped at the shore of the Assa River to bathe. 
When she was emerging from the river, she reached for her clothes and was bitten by a snake that had slithered into her clothes, while she was in the water. 
The bite was fatal and she died soon after. The Emir was returning from a military mission to meet her but was too late. 
He ordered the construction of the tomb to commemorate her and their love for eternity. — Oral History, as Recorded from a Kazakh of Taraz 
Russian archeologist V. V. Bartold was the first scientist to record and study the ruins in 1893.[4] The Soviet Union built a protective glass shell to preserve the monument (c 1960) and used it for the education of students in Taraz and tourism. 
In 2002, the Republic of Kazakhstan paid Nishan Rameto to restore the Aisha Bibi and built the park infrastructure around it.[2] Shoqan Walikhanov painted monument in his work in 1856.

She moved to Cape Town in 1929 to escape the persecution of Jews and communists. 
Early life 
Simons was born in Varklia (Varakļāni), Latvia as Rachel Ester Alexandrowich on 31 December 1913. 
She was one of six children from Simka Simon and Dobe Alexandrowich.[1] Her father was a teacher of Russian language, German Language and mathematics. 
He also ran a cheder where the Jewish boys studied talmud and prepared their bar mizvah. 
She lived in a rich household full of books which exposed her to socialist and communist ideologist. 
Her father died when she was 12 years old. 
His best friend, Leib Jaffe, influenced Ray's thinking about socialist ideas and awareness of the vital function of organization to advance worker's right.[2] The death of her father caused Simons to become an atheist.[1] 
At the age of 13, she joined the underground Latvian Communist Party.[3] When Simons was fourteen, she was invited to participate in a debate on the Balfour Declaration which was held by local Zionist organization. 
She declined because she believed that the fight against antisemitism should be a part of broader humanity's strive to achieve a new order of the world where all humankind would be free, including Jews. 
Because of persecution of Jews in Varakļāni, she was sent to Riga to advance her studies at the ORT technical college and lived with her close friend Leah.[2][3] 
Cape Town 
After Leah was arrested for her political activities, her mother was worried and immediately arranged for Simons to live with her sister on board German East Afrika Liner, Ubena. 
She left Varaklan on 17 October 1929 and arrived at Cape Town to meet her sister at the docks on 6 November 1929, a day before the anniversary of the Russian Revolution.[4] Five days after her arrival on 11 November 1929, she met Cissie Gool and lifelong friend John Gomas and joined the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA). 
At that time, Simons was 16 years old.[5] 
Simons was fired from her first job after she participated in the anti-pass campaign.[6] She became increasingly involved in trade union activity after she was fired from her job because of her attendance at founding conference of the Anti-Fascist League.[7] Simon was elected as the chair of the Cape Town District Committee of the Communist Party in January 1931.[3] Simon worked in a dress shop and accompanied James Schuba who she met at the meeting of the party on the weekends to visit dock and harbour workers.[4] Three years after her arrival, she was elected to be Secretary of the Commercial Employees' Union in Cape Town. 
In 1935, she lost her job at the dress shop and she became full-time organizer of the Non-European Railway and Harbor Workers' Union[5] She was also a Secretary of the Communist Party for two years, from 1934 to 1935.[6] 
Simons founded Food and Canning Workers Union (FCWU) by organising coloured, black and white workers which was known for its effectiveness and militancy. 
It spread through the fruit canning industry of the Boland to the west coast among fishing communities. 
She became General Secretary of that organization. 
FCWU played an important role in the South African Congress of Trade Unions on the 1950s.[1][8] Using Suppression of Communism Act of 1950 to ban the communist party in 1953, she was ordered to quit the position next year.[3]

Absa was founded in 1991 through the merger of financial service providers United Bank (South Africa), the Allied Bank (South Africa), the Volkskas Bank Group and certain interests of the Sage Group.[9] The following year, Absa acquired the entire shareholding of the Bankorp Group which included Trustbank, Senbank and Bankfin. In the early years of this union, each bank operated under its own name. In 1998, they were fused into one single brand. 
In May 2005, Barclays Bank of the United Kingdom purchased 56.4% stake in Absa.[11] 
In 2013, the group acquired the entire issued share capital of Barclays Africa Limited and issued 129,540,636 Consideration Shares to Barclays Africa Group Holdings Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of Barclays) thus increasing the shareholding of Barclays plc to 62,3%.

DHL International GmbH (DL)[3] is an international courier, package delivery and express mail service, which is a division of the German logistics firm Deutsche Post. The company delivers over 1.5 billion parcels per year.[4] 
The company was founded in San Francisco, USA, in 1969 and expanded its service throughout the world by the late 1970s. In 1979, under the name of DHL Air Cargo, the company entered the Hawaiian islands with an inter-island cargo service using two DC-3 and four DC-6 aircraft. Adrian Dalsey and Larry Hillblom personally oversaw the daily operations until its eventual bankruptcy closed the doors in 1983. 
At its peak, DHL Air Cargo employed just over 100 workers, management and pilots. 
In 1998, Deutsche Post began to acquire shares in DHL. 
It reached controlling interest in 2001, and acquired all outstanding shares by December 2002.[5] The company then absorbed DHL into its Express division, while expanding the use of the DHL brand to other Deutsche Post divisions, business units, and subsidiaries. Today, DHL Express shares its DHL brand with business units such as DHL Global Forwarding and DHL Supply Chain.[6] It gained a foothold in the United States when it acquired Airborne Express. 
The DHL Express financial results are published in the Deutsche Post AG annual report.[1] In 2016, this division's revenue increased by 2.7% to €14 billion.[7] The earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) increased by 11.3% over 2015 to €1.5 billion.[8] 
J. Frank Dobie High School is a public secondary school located in Houston, Texas. Founded in 1968, it is named after the Texas writer of the same name.[2] It houses grades 10-12. 
A Ninth Grade Center was opened recently to help with the influx of students. 
It is the largest school in the Pasadena Independent School District. The school mascots are the Longhorns and the official colors are orange and black, similar to that of the University of Texas at Austin. 
Dobie High School's Academic Decathlon teams took home the national championship in 1992 and 1996, and second in the nation in 2011.[10][11] 
In 2016, Dobie High School student Jaylon Bolden won third place at the National Speech and Debate Association Tournament in Dramatic Interpretation.[12] 
In 2017, Dobie High School student Ariana Uriah Okhuozagbon won fourth place at the National Speech and Debate Association Tournament in Original Oratory.[1] 
Dobie High School was originally located at 11111 Beamer Rd. 
However, overcrowding problems at the Beamer campus and the rapidly growing population in the South Belt area lead city officials and voters to pass a $199.05 million bond in February 2000. This included a new 490,000-square-foot (46,000 m2) location to be built at 10220 Blackhawk Blvd which opened in 2003.[3] 
The original Beamer location is now occupied by Beverly Hills Intermediate School.[4] 
In 2014, PISD announced plans to create a 9th grade center in order to reduce overcrowding at Dobie High.[5] In 2015, the district revealed the design plans for the 9th grade center,[6] and groundbreaking occurred in August 2016.[7] The Dobie Ninth Grade campus opened its doors on January 9, 2018 and a dedication ceremony was held on December 6, 2018.

The chief administrative officer (CAO) of Ponoka County is Charlie Cutforth.[1] The five members of council, Nancy Hartford, Bryce Liddle, Mark Matejka, Paul McLauchlin, and Doug Weir, were elected October 21, 2013.[1] Councillor Paul McLauchlin, from electoral division 4, was selected the reeve in a 2013 organizational meeting.[10] 
Ponoka County was founded on January 1, 1952.[4] The county's first public officials were Mr. Bruce Ramsey, who directed municipal affairs, Mr. Peter McDonald as secretary-treasurer, and Mr. L.G. Saunders was head of the school system. 
The town gets its name from the Blackfoot word for Elk. 
In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Ponoka County recorded a population of 9,806 living in 3,535 of its 4,199 total private dwellings, a 10.7% change from its 2011 population of 8,856. With a land area of 2,814.26 km2 (1,086.59 sq mi), it had a population density of 3.5/km2 (9.0/sq mi) in 2016.[2]

Tendai (天台宗, Tendai-shū), also known as the Tendai Lotus School (天台法華宗 Tendai hokke shū, sometimes just "hokke shū") is a Mahāyāna Buddhist tradition (with significant esoteric elements) officially established in Japan in 806 by the Japanese monk Saichō (posthumously known as Dengyō Daishi).[1] The Tendai school, which has been based on Mount Hiei since its inception, rose to prominence during the Heian period (794-1185). It gradually eclipsed the powerful Hossō school and competed with the rival Shingon school to become the most influential sect at the Imperial court. 
By the Kamakura period (1185-1333), Tendai had become one of the dominant forms of Japanese Buddhism, with numerous temples and vast landholdings. 
During the Kamakura period, various monks left Tendai (seeing it as corrupt) to establish their own "new" or "Kamakura" Buddhist schools such as Jōdo-shū, Nichiren-shū and Sōtō Zen.[2] The destruction of the head temple of Enryaku-ji by Oda Nobunaga in 1571, as well as the geographic shift of the capital away from Kyoto to Edo, further weakened Tendai's influence.[3] 
Both traditions emphasize the importance of the Lotus Sutra and revere the teachings of Tiantai patriarchs, especially Zhiyi. In English, the Japanese romanization distinguishes the unique features of the Japanese tradition. According to Hazama Jikō, the main characteristic of Tendai "is its advocacy of a comprehensive Buddhism...the idea that all the teachings of the Buddha are ultimately without contradiction and can be unified in one comprehensive and perfect system."[4] 
Tendai Passion Ndoro (born 15 May 1988) is a Zimbabwean footballer. He plays for Al-Orouba in the Oman Professional League and the Zimbabwe national team as a centre forward. 
Ndoro started his career with Chicken Inn of Zimbabwe in 2011.[1] Two years later, Ndoro completed a move to South African club Black Aces but was immediately returned to Chicken Inn on loan for the rest of the 2013 season.[2] In 2014, he officially joined the Black Aces squad and subsequently made 41 appearances and scored 14 goals over two seasons before departing in 2015 to join Orlando Pirates.[3] 
In the 2017–18 season he appeared for three clubs - Orlando Pirates, Al Faisaly, and Ajax Cape Town, in breach of FIFA regulations. As a result, Ajax Cape Town had to forfeit the three league games he had appeared in for them, resulting in their relegation from the South African Premier League.[4] 
On 27 December 2019, Al-Orouba from Oman announced that they had signed Ndoro.[6] 
Tendai Mzungu (born 28 February 1986) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the Fremantle Football Club and Greater Western Sydney Giants in the Australian Football League (AFL). Mzungu represented the Perth Football Club in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) before being recruited to Fremantle at the end of the 2010 season, and made his debut for the club the following season. 
Born in Melbourne to a Zimbabwean father and an Australian mother, Mzungu moved to Perth, Western Australia, at the age of nine.[1] He attended Kent Street Senior High School, and played amateur football for the Trinity Aquinas Football Club.[2] Falling into the Perth Football Club's recruitment zone in the WAFL, Mzungu made his senior debut for the club in 2006.[3] He played 72 games over 5 years, winning the Butcher Medal Perth's best and fairest award in 2010,[4] and polling 20 votes in the 2010 Sandover Medal.[5] 
Mzungu performed well for Fremantle in the 2011 NAB Cup pre-season games and was tipped to replace the injured Roger Hayden in Fremantle's backline.[7] However, in Fremantle's final pre-season game he damaged his knee medial ligament[8] He returned to football 10 weeks later, to be selected directly to the AFL, rather than for Perth in the WAFL.[9] His debut for Fremantle was in the Round 9 match at AAMI Stadium against Port Adelaide, which Fremantle won by 52 points. 
He was selected as the substitute player[10] and only played the final quarter, replacing Hayden Ballantyne who suffered from a corked thigh (quadriceps contusion).[11] 
Tendai Mzungu played for Fremantle in the 2013 AFL Grand Final against Hawthorn, Fremantle's first ever Grand Final in their history. In the second quarter, Mzungu scored Fremantle's first goal of the game. 
He was delisted at the conclusion of the 2016 season,[12] however, he was drafted by Greater Western Sydney in the 2017 rookie draft.[13] After playing four games for Greater Western Sydney, Mzungu announced his retirement following their preliminary final exit to the 2017 AFL season.[14] 
Mzungu has been Fremantle's team runner and inaugural Next Generation Academy coach since the 2018 AFL season.[15] 
Biti was re-elected to the House of Assembly from Harare East in the March 2008 parliamentary election. According to official results, he received 8,377 votes against 2,587 for the ZANU-PF candidate.[4] In the period following the election, he stayed outside of Zimbabwe (mainly in South Africa), along with Tsvangirai, amidst a post-electoral situation that was marked by serious violence against MDC supporters.[5] 
Biti returned to Zimbabwe on 12 June 2008 and was immediately arrested at the airport in Harare. 
Before his departure from Johannesburg, Biti said that he had already learned that he would be arrested, but maintained that his only crime was "fighting for democracy" and said that it was necessary for him to return to participate in the MDC's struggle.[6] Following Biti's arrest, police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said that he would be charged with treason, based on an MDC document about changing the government.[7] This document, which was called "The Transition Strategy" and was said to have been written by Biti on 25 March,[8] included purported plans to rig the election in favour of the MDC.[8][4] Bvudzijena said that Biti would additionally be charged with making false statements "prejudicial to the state" due to his announcement of election results prior to their release by the Electoral Commission.[7][8] United States Ambassador James McGee expressed deep concern on behalf of the US government, saying that the document in question was an unobjectionable statement of the MDC's plans and goals; according to McGee, another, more extreme version of the document existed, but it was forged.[7] Biti's lawyer also claimed that the material in question was forged.[10] 
On 13 June, Biti's lawyers said that they had not been allowed to meet with him, and they filed an urgent application with the High Court on the same day. The MDC said that it was "deeply worried" about Biti's welfare and that it had sent a team to police stations across Harare, hoping to determine where he was being held.[11] He appeared in court on 14 June.[12] 
Biti's home was searched by the police on 16 June, although the police did not take anything out of the home.[9][13] His lawyer, Lewis Uriri, said that Biti had been interrogated for a full 24 hours after his arrest; Uriri also said that he would seek an order from the High Court to release Biti on the grounds that he had been held without charge for more than the allowed 48-hour period.[9] 
Biti again appeared in court on 18 June; however, this hearing was postponed to the next day because the power failed, meaning that the hearing could not be recorded.[14] He was charged on 19 June.[2][3] He faced four charges: "treason, communicating falsehoods prejudicial to the State, insulting President Mugabe and causing disaffection among the defence forces"..[8] Prosecutors argued against granting bail to Biti, noting that the charges against him were so serious that he could be executed. 
The defence submitted an application to have the charges thrown out, but on 20 June magistrate Mishrod Guvamombe dismissed this application, saying that he believed there was "reasonable suspicion that the accused committed the said offence". Biti's next court appearance was set for 7 July, and Guvamombe ordered that he remain in custody until then.[10] 
On 26 June, Biti was granted bail at one trillion Zimbabwean dollars; he was also required to surrender his home's title deeds and to report to the police on a weekly basis.[15] Biti's lawyers later filed a petition asking for the return of his passport so that he could attend talks between the parties in South Africa, and as a result his passport was returned to him on 9 July, enabling him to go. He led the MDC-Tsvangirai delegation to the talks, which began in Pretoria on 10 July, although according to Tsvangirai the purpose of this was only to set the MDC-Tsvangirai's conditions for participating in the talks, not to actually participate in them.[16][17] 
Uriri applied for the removal of Biti's remand on the grounds that a trial date should have been set and the police investigation should have been completed. On 27 August 2008, Chioniso Mutongi, a magistrate in Harare, rejected this request, saying that Biti had not been on remand long enough for its removal to be appropriate.[18] 
Tendai Laxton Biti (born 6 August 1966) is a Zimbabwean politician who served as Finance Minister of Zimbabwe from 2009 to 2013. 
He is the current Member of Parliament for Harare East Constituency and the second Vice President of Movement for Democratic Change.[1] He was the Secretary-General of the Movement for Democratic Change and the subsequent Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai (MDC-T) political parties and a Member of Parliament for Harare East until he was expelled from the party and recalled from parliament in mid-2014,before winning the seat again in 2018.[2] 
On 10 February 2009, MDC leader and Prime Minister-designate Morgan Tsvangirai announced the appointment of Biti as Finance Minister in the Government of National Unity. Though he has no known history in financial and economic matters, analysts suggest that Tsavingarai really had no other option considering Biti's position in the MDC. In addition, he is known to drive a hard bargain and could be the best person to deal with the Zanu-PF controlled public service. 
Return to legal career 
On 20 November 2013, Biti announced he would be opening a new law firm.[22] The firm was to specialize in international finance law as well as domestic constitutional issues. 
Return to politics 
Biti fell out with Tsvangirai in 2014, resulting in Tsvangirai announcing Biti's expulsion in April 2014.[23] In 2015 Biti joined other disaffected MDC-T members in a breakaway group, MDC-Renewal, becoming its secretary-general. In September 2015, MDC-Renewal launched as a separate party, the People's Democratic Party, and Biti was elected president of the new party.[24][25] 
In 2020, Biti criticized a three-member delegation from South African which was sent to investigate human rights abuses when they returned to their country without speaking to opposition groups.[26] 
In February 2019 he was convicted of contravening the Electoral Act for illegally announcing purported results for the 2018 presidential election in Zimbabwe. 
He was fined $200.[27] 
Biti was born in Dzivarasekwa, Harare, and he is the eldest in a family of 6 children. From 1980 to 1985 he attended Goromonzi High School, where he was appointed deputy head boy in 1985. 
He enrolled in the University of Zimbabwe law school as a freshman in 1986. In 1988 and 1989, Biti was Secretary General of the University of Zimbabwe Student Representative Council, with Terry Mhungu as SRC President, which led student protests against government censorship in academia. After school, he joined the Law firm Honey and Blackenberg, where he became the youngest partner by the age of 26. 
Biti lost his father in his early 30s. 
In 1999 he helped found the MDC. He was elected Member of Parliament for the Harare East constituency in 2000. 
During the Fifth Parliament he served as a member of the Parliament Portfolio Committee on Lands, Agriculture, Water Development, Rural Resources and Resettlement and that on Defence and Home Affairs. In March 2005 he retained the constituency. He serves in the Portfolio Committee on Budget, Finance and Economic Development and is currently the MDC's Secretary General. 
He was arrested in 2007 with many others, including MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai, after a prayer rally in the Harare township of Highfield. 
On 16 June 2007, Biti and Welshman Ncube met with Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa and Labor Minister Nicholas Goche, in Pretoria, South Africa. South African President Thabo Mbeki, appointed by the Southern African Development Community, presided over the negotiations which sought to end sanctions on Zimbabwe top ZANU-PF leaders or top government officials.[3] 
At first received limited game time. Later he had the opportunity to be a reserve during the test against the Wallabies in Perth. Once he came on, his impact was significant; he went on to be a part of the starting lineup for all the subsequent Tri-nations tests. 
A highlight of Mtawarira's career to date came in the first test of the British & Irish Lions tour in 2009. Scrumming against Phil Vickery, Mtawarira dominated his more experienced opponent, leading to Vickery being substituted after 45 minutes, and a man-of-the-match award for Mtawarira.[6] However, he conceded several penalties in the second test when playing opposite Welsh prop Adam Jones. Similarly, in the third test, Mtawarira was largely ineffectual in the scrum, with the returning Vickery and replacement John Hayes subduing him up front. 
On 16 June 2018, Mtawarira played his 100th test match against England. He was dropped to the bench for South Africa's loss to Australia on 8 September 2018, and sustained a neck injury against New Zealand on 6 October 2018, meaning he missed the Springboks' 2018 tour to Europe. 
Mtawarira was named in South Africa's squad for the 2019 Rugby World Cup.[7] South Africa went on to win the tournament, defeating England in the final.[8] Mtawarira's scrummaging in the final was described as destructive, and South Africa won many scrum penalties.[9] 
As well as his 117 Test matches, Mtawarira has played uncapped games for the Springboks against the Barbarians in 2010 and 2016, and against World XVs in 2014 and 2015. He has also played twice for the Barbarians. 
Tendai Mtawarira (born 1 August 1985) is a Zimbabwean professional rugby union player who plays for Old Glory DC in Major League Rugby and previously for the South Africa national team and the Sharks in Super Rugby. He was born in Zimbabwe and qualified for South Africa on residency grounds, before later acquiring South African citizenship. 
Mtawarira, a prop, is known by the nickname The Beast. 
Test tries 
Although Mtawarira was fully eligible to play for South Africa under IRB rules, his Zimbabwean nationality was a sticking point in 2009 and 2010. South Africa has a policy of only allowing its nationals to represent the country, although it has been somewhat flexible; the South African Rugby Union (SARU) officially cleared him to play with the Boks in the November 2009 Tests, after receiving clearance from the country's sports minister Makhenkesi Stofile.[10] 
More recently, his citizenship was a minor political issue in the country. In January 2010, Butana Komphela, an ANC member of the National Assembly and chair of its sports committee, publicly threatened to charge the SARU with "illegally" fielding Mtawarira and have him deported to Zimbabwe.[11] Shortly after the threat, Mtawarira told the Sunday Independent, 
Later in the year, the South African government reaffirmed its policy that only South African nationals would be allowed to represent the country in international competition, which made Mtawarira unavailable for selection to the Springboks in the June Tests; by that time, his application for South African citizenship had been tied up in red tape. On 25 June 2010, the SARU announced that Minister of Home Affairs Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma had granted Mtawarira's request for South African citizenship. The immediate effect was to make him eligible for selection in the 2010 Tri Nations.[13] 
Mtawarira made his debut for South Africa against Wales on 14 June 2008. With 117 caps, he is the most capped prop in South African history and the third most capped Springbok of all time behind Victor Matfield and Bryan Habana. 
He attended Churchill School in Harare for five years before being given a full scholarship to Peterhouse Boys' School, an independent school in Mashonaland East. At the age of 15, while at Churchill, he was spotted by Zimbabwean coach Joey Muwadzuri who invited him to join the Under 19 side at the National Schools Festival. Later that year Muwadzuri invited him to be part of Cats and Dogs Rugby Academy Team that won the National Seniors 7's tournament. 
Maturure has spent a large part of his career with the Harare City Hornets in Zimbabwe.[1] He has also played for Raiders and JBC.

In 2021, Maturure was named the MVP of the Decade by the Basketball Union of Zimbabwe (ZUB).[3] 
Maturure plays for the Zimbabwean national team. He was one of the team's top scorers at AfroBasket 2015.[4]

The Christian doctrine of the Trinity (Latin: Trinitas, lit. 'triad', from Latin: trinus "threefold")[1] defines God as being one god existing in three coequal, coeternal, consubstantial persons:[2][3] God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ) and God the Holy Spirit — three distinct persons sharing one essence.[4] In this context, the three persons define who God is, while the one essence defines what God is.[5] This doctrine is called Trinitarianism and its adherents are called trinitarians, while its opponents are called antitrinitarians or nontrinitarians. Nontrinitarian positions include Unitarianism, Binitarianism and Modalism. 
While the developed doctrine of the Trinity is not explicit in the books that constitute the New Testament, the New Testament possesses a triadic understanding of God[6] and contains a number of Trinitarian formulas.[7] The doctrine of the Trinity was first formulated among the early Christians and fathers of the Church as early Christians attempted to understand the relationship between Jesus and God in their scriptural documents and prior traditions.[8] 
While the developed doctrine of the Trinity is not explicit in the books that constitute the New Testament, the New Testament contains a number of Trinitarian formulas, including Matthew 28:19, 2 Corinthians 13:13, 1 Corinthians 12:4-5, Ephesians 4:4-6, 1 Peter 1:2 and Revelation 1:4-5.[7][9] Reflection by early Christians on passages such as the Great Commission: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" and Paul the Apostle's blessing: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all", leading theologians across history in attempting to articulate the relationship between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Eventually, the diverse references to God, Jesus, and the Spirit found in the New Testament were brought together to form the doctrine of the Trinity—one Godhead subsisting in three persons and one substance. 
The doctrine of the Trinity was used to oppose alternative views of how the three are related and to defend the church against charges of worshiping two or three gods.[10] 
In mathematics, computer science, and logic, rewriting covers a wide range of (potentially non-deterministic) methods of replacing subterms of a formula with other terms. The objects of focus for this article include rewriting systems (also known as rewrite systems, rewrite engines,[1][2] or reduction systems). In their most basic form, they consist of a set of objects, plus relations on how to transform those objects. 
In linguistics, phrase structure rules, also called rewrite rules, are used in some systems of generative grammar,[8] as a means of generating the grammatically correct sentences of a language. Such a rule typically takes the form A → X, where A is a syntactic category label, such as noun phrase or sentence, and X is a sequence of such labels or morphemes, expressing the fact that A can be replaced by X in generating the constituent structure of a sentence. For example, the rule S → NP VP means that a sentence can consist of a noun phrase followed by a verb phrase; further rules will specify what sub-constituents a noun phrase and a verb phrase can consist of, and so on. 
One rule to rewrite a term could be applied in many different ways to that term, or more than one rule could be applicable. Rewriting systems then do not provide an algorithm for changing one term to another, but a set of possible rule applications. When combined with an appropriate algorithm, however, rewrite systems can be viewed as computer programs, and several theorem provers[3] and declarative programming languages are based on term rewriting.[4][5] 
From the above examples, it is clear that we can think of rewriting systems in an abstract manner. We need to specify a set of objects and the rules that can be applied to transform them. 
The most general (unidimensional) setting of this notion is called an abstract reduction system[9] or abstract rewriting system (abbreviated ARS).[10] An ARS is simply a set A of objects, together with a binary relation → on A called the reduction relation, rewrite relation[11] or just reduction.[9] 
In logic, the procedure for obtaining the conjunctive normal form (CNF) of a formula can be implemented as a rewriting system.[6] The rules of an example of such a system would be: 
where the symbol ( → {\displaystyle \to } ) indicates that an expression matching the left hand side of the rule can be rewritten to one formed by the right hand side, and the symbols each denote a subexpression. In such a system, each rule is chosen so that the left side is equivalent to the right side, and consequently when the left side matches a subexpression, performing a rewrite of that subexpression from left to right maintains logical consistency and value of the entire expression. 
To this end, each such number has to be encoded as a term. The simplest encoding is the one used in the Peano axioms, based on the constant 0 (zero) and the successor function S. for example, the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 are represented by the terms 0, S(0), S(S(0)), and S(S(S(0))), respectively. The following term rewriting system can then be used to compute sum and product of given natural numbers.[7] 
The Doctrine and Covenants (sometimes abbreviated and cited as D&C or D. and C.) is a part of the open scriptural canon of several denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement. Originally published in 1835 as Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of the Latter Day Saints: Carefully Selected from the Revelations of God, editions of the book continue to be printed mainly by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and the Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints [RLDS Church]). 
Park Sun-young (born May 30, 1989),[2] known professionally as Hyomin, is a South Korean singer, songwriter and actress. 
She is a member of South Korean girl group T-ara. Apart from her group's activities, Hyomin has also starred in various television dramas such as My Girlfriend is a Nine-Tailed Fox (2010), Gye Baek (2011), The Thousandth Man (2012), and in various films such as Gisaeng Ryung (2011) and Jinx!!! (2013). 
She debuted as a solo artist with her debut EP, Make Up, on June 30, 2014. 
During T-ara's "Roly-Poly" promotions in June 2011, Hyomin designed her own stage costume, which flaunted a retro pattern and short shorts that were popular during the period.[25] 
Hyomin launched an exclusive clothing collection, in collaboration with celebrity stylist Kim Sung-il, for G-Market on June 4, 2012.[26] Hyomin has come up with a total of 150 products for the collection, and has been actively involved with the planning, designing, and product launch preparations for the shop.[citation needed] 
In 2016, Hyomin also became the face of Brave Brothers's brand new makeup brand, "Brave i" and filmed a commercial film.[citation needed] 
In 2019, Hyomin has collaborated with VT Cosmetics and KODI to launch a new cosmetic brand named "MINITT" on February 25, 2019. 
Hyomin directly participated in the planning, designing and development process.[citation needed] 
The brand's name "MINITT" is a combination of Hyomin's "MIN" and "MINUTE", which means "fall into the charms of MINITT at the moment". 
The brand's slogan is "Draw your color, Draw your MINITT".[citation needed] 
Hyomin was born Park Sun-young on May 30, 1989, in Busan, South Korea, and is the only child in her family. In 1997, Hyomin's path to stardom started early when she won the MiMi Princess modeling contest at the age of 8.[citation needed] She was a famous internet ulzzang and even modeled for online shopping malls before debuting with T-ara.[3] She was a trainee under JYP Entertainment and was considered to be a replacement for Hyuna, who was a member of the Wonder Girls in 2007.[4] Before being cast by Core Contents Media, she started appearing in music videos, such as SS501's "Unlock", SG Wannabe's "Smooth Break-Up" and FT Island's "Heaven". 
The Book of Abraham is an 1835 work produced by Joseph Smith[4] that he said was based on Egyptian papyri purchased from a traveling mummy exhibition. 
According to Smith, the book was "a translation of some ancient records ... purporting to be the writings of Abraham, while he was in Egypt, called the Book of Abraham, written by his own hand, upon papyrus".[5] The text that Smith produced describes a story of Abraham's early life, including a vision of the cosmos. 
The Book of Abraham was canonized in 1880 by the LDS Church as part of the Pearl of Great Price.[1] Thus, it forms a doctrinal foundation for the LDS Church and Mormon fundamentalist denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement. It is not considered to be a religious text by the Community of Christ. 
Other sects in the Latter Day Saint movement have various opinions regarding the Book of Abraham, with some rejecting and some accepting the text as inspired scripture. 
The book contains several doctrines that are distinct to Mormonism, such as the concept of God organizing eternal, pre-existing elements to create the universe instead of creating it ex nihilo. 
Joseph Smith–Matthew (abbreviated JS–M) is an excerpt from Joseph Smith's "retranslation" of portions of the Gospel of Matthew. It was originally published in 1831 in Kirtland, Ohio, in an undated broadsheet as "Extract from the New Translation of the Bible". 
Joseph Smith–Matthew includes Smith's retranslation of Matthew 23:39 and all of Matthew chapter 24. The text deals mainly with Jesus' prophecy of the coming destruction of Jerusalem and of similar calamities that will precede his Second Coming. Joseph Smith–Matthew contains significant changes and additions to the original biblical text. 
The first paragraph of the Introductory Note in the LDS edition of the Pearl of Great Price states: "The Pearl of Great Price is a selection of choice materials touching many significant aspects of the faith and doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. These items were produced by Joseph Smith and were published in the Church periodicals of his day." 
The incidents described in Joseph Smith–History include the First Vision and the visitation of the angel Moroni. In its current form, the narrative ends with Smith translating the Book of Mormon, shortly before the foundation of Smith's Church of Christ, though the original Times and Seasons serial it is based on continued the story until the mid-1830s. 
The Articles of Faith are a creed composed by Joseph Smith as part of an 1842 letter sent to "Long" John Wentworth, editor of the Chicago Democrat, and first published in the Latter Day Saint newspaper Times and Seasons. It is a concise listing of thirteen fundamental doctrines of Mormonism. Most Latter Day Saint denominations view the articles as an authoritative statement of basic theology. 
For some sects, they are known collectively as "An Epitome of Faith and Doctrine". 
The original contents of the Pearl of Great Price were significantly different, reproducing material found in the Doctrine and Covenants and a poem entitled "Oh Say What is Truth?" (which is now found in the LDS Church hymnal). In 1878, some material was added to the Book of Moses. 
The Pearl of Great Price was canonized by the LDS Church in 1880. 
In 1902, the material reproduced in the Doctrine and Covenants was removed. 
Two other documents, Vision of the Celestial Kingdom and Vision of the Redemption of the Dead,[6] were added to the Pearl of Great Price in 1976 and moved to the LDS Church edition of the Doctrine and Covenants (sections 137 and 138) in 1979.[7] 
The name of the book is derived from the Parable of the Pearl told by Jesus in Matthew 13.[1] 
The Pearl of Great Price was first compiled by Franklin D. Richards in Liverpool, England. Some items duplicated text that was already available in the Doctrine and Covenants. 
It contained the following entries (the placement of the text in today's LDS Church publications is noted in parenthesis): 
The Book of Moses begins with the "Visions of Moses," a prologue to the story of the creation and the fall of man (Moses chapter 1), and continues with material corresponding to Smith's revision (JST) of the first six chapters of the Book of Genesis (Moses chapters 2–5, 8), interrupted by two chapters of "extracts from the prophecy of Enoch" (Moses chapters 6–7). Portions of the Book of Moses were originally published separately by the LDS Church in 1851, but later combined and published as the Book of Moses in the Pearl of Great Price. 
The same material is published by the Community of Christ as parts of its Doctrine and Covenants and Inspired Version of the Bible. 
In 1939, Sen and Gertrude took initiative in setting up Uday Shankar Cultural Centre at Almora. 
But the centre lasted only for five years. 
Sen was also deeply spiritual in nature. 
He was inspired by the monks from Ramakrishna Math. He had nursed Swami Sadananda during his last days and was also initiated by him. 
Sen was also close to Swami Brahmananda, the first president of the Ramakrishna Mission.[1] He wrote at least one article, titled "Science and Religion".[11] 
Later life 
Basiswar "Boshi" Sen (1887 – 31 August 1971) was an Indian agricultural scientist. He was a pioneer of the Green Revolution movement that changed the food landscape of India by growing abundant food grains, thereby reducing the possibility of any famine in the country. 
His wife was Gertrude Emerson Sen, an American author and specialist on Asia. 
He founded the Vivekananda Laboratory in the Almora region of the Himalayas. 
He was a friend of many notable people, such as Indian Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, poet Rabindranath Tagore, Julian Huxley, and D. H. Lawrence. Sen was also associated with the Ramakrishna Order and the Ramakrishna Vivekananda movement, as well as with Jagadish Chandra Bose, the Indian scientist, and Sister Nivedita, the writer, orator, freedom fighter and direct disciple of Swami Vivekananda.[1] The Government of India awarded him the third-highest civilian honour of Padma Bhushan in 1957.[2] 
Sen was born in Bishnupur area in Bengal in 1887. 
His father's name was Rameswar Sen, who was the first graduate of Calcutta University from Bankura district of Bengal. 
His mother's name was Prasannamoyi Devi. Sens elder brother Sureswar Sen was an ardent devotee of the Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi.[3] Owing to the untimely death of Rameshwar, the Sen family was in financial strain. 
Sen (or Boshi as he came to be known in his later life), completed his school education by staying with a sister in Ranchi. 
He passed the BSc examination from St. Xavier's College in Calcutta. 
He was introduced to Ramakrishna Order by his friend Bibhuti Bhushon Ghosh. 
Sen was intimately associated with Swami Sadananda, also called Gupta Maharaj, a direct monastic disciple of Swami Vivekananda. Boshi also took a few photographs of the Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi. 
The Great Bengal Famine of 1943 had changed Sen's outlook towards research and from research on plant cell his focus shifted to applied research on agriculture and food grain productivity. In this matter he was deeply influenced by the humanistic endeavours and messages of Swami Vivekananda who identified food problem as one of the major problems plaguing British India.[1][8] His research in practical and applied agriculture included plant introduction, plant breeding and production of hybrid seeds of maize, jowar, bajra, and onion. 
He followed the claims of Trofim Lysenko to develop so-called vernalized crop varieties.[9] In his Vivekananda Laboratory, he was successful in production of hybrid maize seeds and hybrid onions. 
For his pioneering work which heralded Green Revolution in India, he was awarded Padma Bhushan in 1957 and Watmull award in 1962. 
He was allotted land for the expansion of his work by Uttar Pradesh Government in Hawalbagh. 
In 1959 his Laboratory was transferred to U. P. Government, and it allotted 215 acre land for scientific research.[10] 
UMvelinqangi, contrary to widespread belief[citation needed] is not personified. Umvelinqangi is most accurately described as the inner light of creation. 
Ukukhothama (meditation) was a widespread practice prior to westernisation among the Zulu clan. Ukukhothama was seen as a way of attaining ubunye noMvelinqangi (oneness with the divine conscious). This practice is primarily the reason why the amaZulu clan survived through the ages without any form of western/modern resources. 
Umelo is a surname. 
Notable people with the surname include: 
Grace Umelo (born 1978), Nigerian athlete Rosina Umelo (born 1930), Nigerian writer 
Grace Umelo (born 10 July 1978) is a retired Nigerian athlete who specialised in the long jump.[1] She won several medals at regional level. 
Rosina Umelo (born Rosina Martin, 1930)[1] is a Nigerian writer. She is known for her short stories, children's books and her young adult fiction. She also has published under the pen name Adaeze Madu.[2] 
Rosina "Rose" Martin was born in Cheshire, England, and educated at Bedford College, University of London. 
She married Nigerian John Umelo in 1961, having met him on the London Underground.[1] In 1965, the two moved to Nigeria. She taught Latin at Queens School, Enugu, until the outbreak of the Nigerian Civil War (1967–70). 
She became a citizen of Nigeria in 1971 through marriage.[3] She worked as a principal and created English-language curriculum materials.[3] Later, Umelo became a school administrator.[4] Umelo has at least four children.[5] 
Umelo collected 12 of her short stories for adults into The Man Who Ate the Money (1978), five of which won awards.[1] Nancy J. Schmidt, writing for Africa Today, called Umelo's writing in The Man Who Ate the Money "fresh," even though her subject matter dealt with themes that are common in African fiction.[2] Umelo also wrote for a popular young adult series published by Macmillan, called the Pacesetters Series.[6] Umelo also created works for young adults for the series "Heart Beats", published by Chelsea House Publishers in the 1990s.[7] 
In 1967, the Eastern Region of Nigeria, whose capital was Enugu, seceded as the newly declared nation of Biafra. 
The Umelo family fled from their home in Enugu to John Umelo's home village in the heart of Biafra. 
During the war, Rosina kept notes on her observations, which she wrote up as a narrative immediately after the war, which ended in 1970 with at least a million civilians dead. 
This account, called "A World of our Own," remained unpublished until 2018, when it formed the core of a book, "Surviving Biafra: A Nigerwife's Story," (Hurst Publishers, London), co-authored with anthropologist S. Elizabeth Bird.[8] 
Later in her life, Umelo worked at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan. In 2018, she lived near London in the United Kingdom.[1] 
Typically, a sausage is formed in a casing traditionally made from intestine but sometimes from synthetic materials. Sausages that are sold raw are cooked in many ways, including pan-frying, broiling and barbecuing. 
Some sausages are cooked during processing and the casing may then be removed. 
Sausage making is a traditional food preservation technique. Sausages may be preserved by curing, drying (often in association with fermentation or culturing, which can contribute to preservation), smoking, or freezing. Some cured or smoked sausages can be stored without refrigeration. 
Most fresh sausages must be refrigerated or frozen until they are cooked. 
Etymology 
The word sausage was first used in English in the mid-15th century, spelled sawsyge.[1] This word came from Old North French saussiche (Modern French saucisse).[1] The French word came from Vulgar Latin salsica ("sausage"), from salsicus ("seasoned with salt").[1] 
Sausage making at home 
Sausage making is an outcome of efficient butchery. Traditionally, sausage makers salted various tissues and organs such as scraps, organ meats, blood, and fat to help preserve them. 
They then stuffed them into tubular casings made from the cleaned intestines of the animal, producing the characteristic cylindrical shape. 
Hence, sausages, puddings, and salami are among the oldest of prepared foods, whether cooked and eaten immediately or dried to varying degrees.[citation needed] 
An Akkadian cuneiform tablet records a dish of intestine casings filled with some sort of forcemeat.[2] 
A Chinese type of sausage has been described, lup cheong (pinyin: làcháng) from the Northern and Southern dynasties (589 BC–420 BC), made from goat and lamb meat with salt, and flavoured with green onion, bean sauce, ginger, and pepper. 
The modern type of lup cheong has a comparatively long shelf life, mainly because of a high content of lactobacilli; so high that it is considered sour by many.[3] 
Vegetarian and vegan sausages are also available in some countries, or can be made from scratch at home.[44] These may be made from tofu, seitan, nuts, pulses, mycoprotein, soya protein, vegetables or any combination of similar ingredients that will hold together during cooking.[45] These sausages, like most meat-replacement products, generally fall into two categories: some are shaped, colored, flavored, and spiced to replicate the taste and texture of meat as accurately as possible; others such as the Glamorgan sausage rely on spices and vegetables to lend their natural flavor to the product and no attempt is made to imitate meat.[46] While not vegetarian, the soya sausage was invented 1916 in Germany. 
First known as Kölner Wurst ("Cologne Sausage") by later German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer (1876–1967).[47] 
The Greek poet Homer mentioned a kind of blood sausage in the Odyssey, Epicharmus wrote a comedy titled The Sausage, and Aristophanes' play The Knights is about a sausage vendor who is elected leader. 
Evidence suggests that sausages were already popular both among the ancient Greeks and Romans and most likely with the various tribes occupying the larger part of Europe.[4] 
The most famous sausage in ancient Italy was from Lucania (modern Basilicata) and was called lucanica, a name which lives on in a variety of modern sausages in the Mediterranean.[5] During the reign of the Roman emperor Nero, sausages were associated with the Lupercalia festival.[6] Early in the 10th century during the Byzantine Empire, Leo VI the Wise outlawed the production of blood sausages following cases of food poisoning.[6] 
Traditionally, sausage casings were made of the cleaned intestines,[7] or stomachs in the case of haggis and other traditional puddings. 
Today, however, natural casings are often replaced by collagen, cellulose, or even plastic casings, especially in the case of industrially manufactured sausages. 
Some forms of sausage, such as sliced sausage, are prepared without a casing. 
Additionally, luncheon meat and sausage meat are now available without casings in tin cans and jars.[citation needed] 
A sausage consists of meat cut into pieces or ground, mixed with other ingredients, and filled into a casing. 
Ingredients may include a cheap starch filler such as breadcrumbs or grains, seasoning and flavourings such as spices, and sometimes others such as apple and leek.[8] The meat may be from any animal but is often pork, beef or veal, or poultry. 
The lean meat-to-fat ratio depends upon the style and producer. 
The meat content as labelled may exceed 100%, which happens when the weight of meat exceeds the total weight of the sausage after it has been made, sometimes including a drying process which reduces water content. 
Sausages classification is subject to regional differences of opinion. Various metrics such as types of ingredients, consistency, and preparation are used. In the English-speaking world, the following distinction between fresh, cooked, and dry sausages seems to be more or less accepted: 
A European-style smoked savory hóng cháng (simplified Chinese: 红肠; traditional Chinese: 紅腸 red sausage) is produced in Harbin, China's northernmost major city.[17] It is similar to Lithuanian and Polish sausages including kiełbasa and podhalańska and tends to have a more European flavour than other Chinese sausages. 
This kind of sausage was first produced in a Russian-capitalized factory named Churin sausage factory in 1909. 
Harbin-style sausage has become popular in China, especially in northern regions.[17] 
Sundae, a form of blood sausage, is a traditional Korean sausage. 
A popular street food, sundae is normally prepared by steaming or boiling cow or pig intestines stuffed with various ingredients. The most common variation is composed of pork blood, cellophane noodle, sliced carrot and barley stuffed into pig intestines, but other regional variations include squid or Alaska pollock casings. 
Sundae is eaten plain with salt, in stews, or as part of a stir-fry. 
A sausage is a type of meat product usually made from ground meat, often pork, beef, or poultry, along with salt, spices and other flavourings. Other ingredients such as grains or breadcrumbs may be included as fillers or extenders.

The CFD-DEM model, or Computational Fluid Dynamics / Discrete Element Method model, is a process used to model or simulate systems combining fluids with solids or particles. 
In CFD-DEM, the motion of discrete solids or particles phase is obtained by the Discrete Element Method (DEM) which applies Newton's laws of motion to every particle, while the flow of continuum fluid is described by the local averaged Navier–Stokes equations that can be solved using the traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach. The interactions between the fluid phase and solids phase is modeled by use of Newton's third law. 
OpenMP has been shown to be more efficient in performing coupled CFD-DEM calculations in parallel framework as compared to MPI by Amritkar et al.[7] Recently, a multi-scale parallel strategy[8] is developed. 
Generally, the simulation domain is divided into many sub-domains and each process calculates only one sub-domain using MPI passing boundary information; for each sub-domain, the CPUs are used to solve the fluid phase while the general purpose GPUs are used to solve the movement of particles. However, in this computation method CPUs and GPUs work in serial. 
That is, the CPUs are idle while the GPUs are calculating the solid particles, and the GPUs are idle when the CPUs are calculating the fluid phase. To further accelerate the computation, the CPU and GPU computing can be overlapped using the shared memory of a Linux system. 
Thus, the fluid phase and particles can be calculated at the same time. 
where W {\displaystyle W} is the number of real particles in CGP. 
Then, the movement of CGPs can be tracked using DEM. 
In simulations using Coarse Grained Particles, the real particles in a CGP are subjected to the same drag force, same temperature and same species mass fractions. 
The momentum, heat and mass transfers between fluid and particles are firstly calculated using the diameter of real particles and then scaled by W {\displaystyle W} times. 
The value of W {\displaystyle W} is directly related to computation cost and accuracy.[11] When W {\displaystyle W} is equal to unity, the simulation becomes DEM-based achieving results that are of the highest possible accuracy. 
As this ratio increases, the speed of the simulation increases drastically but its accuracy deteriorates. Apart from an increase in speed, general criteria for selecting a value for this parameter is not yet available. However, for systems with distinct mesoscale structures, like bubbles and clusters, the parcel size should be small enough to resolve the deformation, aggregation, and breakage of bubbles or clusters. 
The process of lumping particles together reduces the collision frequency, which directly influences the energy dissipation. 
To account for this error, an effective restitution coefficient was proposed by Lu et al.,[2] based on kinetic theory of granular flow, by assuming the energy dissipation during collisions for the original system and the coarse grained system are identical. 
In 2015, WWE introduced the Warrior Award for those who have "exhibited unwavering strength and perseverance, and who live life with the courage and compassion that embodies the indomitable spirit of the Ultimate Warrior."[16] 
While WWE promotes Warrior Award recipients as Hall of Fame inductees,[17][18] they are not included in the Hall of Fame section at WWE.com[19] and an image gallery which shows "every WWE Hall of Famer ever" does not contain any recipient.[20] 
The award was created following the Ultimate Warrior's death. 
During his April 2014 Hall of Fame speech shortly before his death, he proposed that there be a special category called the "Jimmy Miranda Award" for WWE's behind-the-scenes employees.[21][22] Miranda, who died in 2002, was part of the WWE merchandise department for more than 20 years.[23] Former WWE ring announcer Justin Roberts expressed disappointment at how WWE used portions of Warrior's Hall of Fame speech to promote the award but left out Warrior's intentions of honoring WWE's off-screen employees.[24][25] WWE responded, "It is offensive to suggest that WWE and its executives had anything, but altruistic intentions in honoring Connor and his legacy with The Warrior Award", adding that "moving forward the award will be given annually to acknowledge other unsung heroes among WWE's employees and fans".[26] Since 2019 all recipients have been WWE employees.[27] 
The WWE Hall of Fame is a hall of fame which honors professional wrestlers and professional wrestling personalities maintained by WWE. Originally known as the "WWF Hall of Fame", it was created in 1993, when André the Giant was posthumously inducted with a video package. 
The 1994 and 1995 ceremonies were held in conjunction with the annual King of the Ring pay-per-view events and the 1996 ceremony was held with the Survivor Series event. After an eight-year hiatus and after the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) had been renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), the promotion relaunched the Hall of Fame in 2004 and has held the ceremonies in conjunction with WrestleMania ever since. Since 2005, portions of the induction ceremonies have aired on television and since 2014, the entire ceremonies have aired on the WWE Network. 
As of 2021, there have been 228 inductees, with 121 wrestlers inducted individually, 46 Legacy Inductees, 17 group inductions (consisting of 49 wrestlers within those groups), 12 celebrities, and 7 Warrior Award recipients. Eight wrestlers have been inducted twice (individually and as part of a tag team/group): Ric Flair, Shawn Michaels, Booker T, Bret Hart, Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, and Sean Waltman (Waltman's two inductions are both as a member of a group, D-Generation X and the New World Order). 
58 members have been inducted posthumously. 
The World Wrestling Federation (WWF) established the WWF Hall of Fame in 1993. 
It was first announced on the March 22, 1993 episode of Monday Night Raw where André the Giant, who had died nearly two months prior, was announced as the sole inductee.[1][2][3] In the proceeding two years, induction ceremonies were held in conjunction with the annual King of the Ring pay-per-view events. 
The 1996 ceremony was held with the Survivor Series event, for the first time in front of a paying audience as well as the wrestlers, after which, the Hall of Fame went on hiatus.[4] 
Following the end of the first brand split in August 2011, both the WWE Champion and World Heavyweight Champion could appear on both Raw and SmackDown. In November 2013, the night after Survivor Series, reigning World Heavyweight Champion John Cena made a challenge to reigning WWE Champion Randy Orton to determine WWE's undisputed world champion. 
Orton defeated Cena in a TLC match at the TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs pay-per-view on December 15, 2013, to unify the titles. 
Subsequently, the unified championship was renamed WWE World Heavyweight Championship and retained the lineage of the WWE Championship; the World Heavyweight Championship was retired.[20] Orton and subsequent champions held both championship belts until a single championship belt was given to reigning champion Brock Lesnar in August 2014.[2] 
After Dean Ambrose became champion in June 2016, the title's name was reverted to WWE Championship.[22][23][24] In light of the return of the brand split the following month, Ambrose was drafted to SmackDown. 
Ambrose then retained his title at Battleground on July 24 against Raw draftees Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns, making the title exclusive to SmackDown.[25] On the July 25 episode of Raw, to address the lack of a world title for the brand, the WWE Universal Championship was created; Finn Bálor became the inaugural champion at SummerSlam.[26] After the unveiling of the Universal title, the WWE Championship was renamed WWE World Championship,[27][28] but reverted to WWE Championship in December 2016 during AJ Styles' first reign.[29] 
At Crown Jewel on October 31, 2019, SmackDown wrestler "The Fiend" Bray Wyatt won the Universal Championship, thus transferring the title to SmackDown. 
Also at that event, after reigning WWE Champion Brock Lesnar had defeated Cain Velasquez to retain the title, he was attacked by Raw's Rey Mysterio, who Lesnar had attacked a few weeks prior.[31] The following night on Friday Night SmackDown, Lesnar quit SmackDown and went to Raw to continue his feud with Mysterio, thus transferring the WWE Championship to Raw.[32] In 2021, the NXT Championship, which had been established for NXT in 2012 (and was WWE's developmental territory until 2019), would be recognized as a concurrent third world title in the promotion.[33] 
With the first brand split, an annual draft was established in 2002. 
Each year (except 2003), the General Managers participated in a draft lottery in which select members of WWE's roster were assigned to a brand. 
The revived ECW became a third brand from 2006 to 2010.[34] On August 29, 2011, WWE ended the brand extension and wrestlers (including all champions), were then free to appear on any program. 
The WWE Championship is a world heavyweight championship created and promoted by the American professional wrestling promotion WWE, currently defended on their Raw brand division. It is one of WWE's three world titles, alongside the Universal Championship on SmackDown and the NXT Championship on NXT. 
The current champion is Big E, who is in his first reign. 
The original world championship of the promotion, it was established by the then-World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) on April 25, 1963, as the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship, after the promotion seceded from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). 
The inaugural champion was Buddy Rogers. Since its inception, the title has undergone many name changes due to company name changes and title unifications. 
It is the oldest championship currently active in WWE, and is presented as being the promotion's most prestigious title, with many matches for the title having headlined pay-per-view events – including WWE's flagship event WrestleMania.[1] In professional wrestling in general, it is considered to be one of the most prestigious championships of all time.[4][5] 
Custom championship belts have been created to honor certain reigning champions or match their characters. 
During Hogan's reign in 1986, he had a modified version of the Hogan '86 made, which included a picture of himself at the center. This was a short lived custom design as he reverted to the Hogan '86 version. A much larger version similar to the Hogan '86 championship belt was created for André the Giant before WrestleMania III, although he never wore it as champion.[58][2] 
Reigns 
The WWE Championship was the first world championship introduced into the promotion in 1963. 
The inaugural champion was Buddy Rogers, and there have been 54 different official champions overall and 11 vacancies.[3] The longest reigning champion is Bruno Sammartino, who held the title from May 17, 1963, to January 18, 1971, for a total of 2,803 days (7 years, 8 months, and 1 day); Sammartino also holds the record for longest combined reign at 4,040 days.[108] André the Giant is the shortest reigning champion, officially holding the title for 1 minute, 48 seconds.[2] The youngest champion is Brock Lesnar, who won the title at the age of 25, while the oldest champion is Mr. McMahon, who won it at the age of 54. 
John Cena holds the record for most reigns with 13.[3] 
Big E is the current champion in his first reign. 
He won the title by cashing in his Money in the Bank contract and defeating Bobby Lashley on the September 13, 2021, episode of Raw in Boston, Massachusetts. Big E is only the fourth African-American wrestler to win the WWE Championship, after The Rock in 1998, Kofi Kingston in 2019, and Bobby Lashley in early 2021.[1] 
Fresh sausages are simply seasoned ground meats that are cooked before serving. Fresh sausages normally do not use cure (Prague powder #1) although cure can be used if desired. In addition fresh sausages typically do not use smoke flavors, although liquid smoke can be used. 
Fresh sausages are never smoked in a cold smoker because of the danger of botulism.[1] 
A British fresh sausage typically contains around 10% butcher's rusk, 10% water, 2.5% seasoning, and 77.5% meat.[3] At the point of sale, British sausages will often be labelled as "actual meat content X%". As meat can be fatty or lean, the X% is calculated using reference tables with the intention to give a fairer representation of the "visual lean" meat content.[4] 
Cured sausages differ from fresh sausages by including 2 teaspoons of cure (Prague powder #1) per 10 pounds of finished product. This is usually interpreted per 10 pounds of meat. 
This works out to 4 ounces of cure for 100 pounds of sausage. 
Next the product is typically hot smoked. 
However, similar effects can be achieved by incorporating liquid smoke in the recipe. Smoking temperatures vary and are typically less than 155 °F (68 °C). At a temperature of 152 °F (67 °C) these sausages are fully cooked. 
In some cases cold smoke is used. 
If so, then the sausage may have been previously cooked in a water bath held at the proper temperature. 
An example of this process is the preparation of Braunschweiger. 
In this style of sausage, after stuffing into 70 mm (2.8 in) to 76 mm (3.0 in) hog buns or fiberous casings, the sausage is submerged in 70 °C (158 °F) water for 2 to 2+1⁄2 hours until the internal temperature reaches 67 °C (153 °F). 
At this point the sausage should be chilled in ice water, then cold smoked at a temperature of 46 to 49 °C (115 to 120 °F) for 2–3 hours.[1] 
Cured dry sausages are prepared in a fashion similar to cured cooked sausages. 
The major difference is that Prague powder #2 will be used in place of Prague powder #1. In addition, certified meats must be used. Since these products are never heated to a temperature that can kill trichinella parasites, it is necessary to accomplish this by other methods. 
The usual method is via freezing. Pork may be rendered acceptable for use in dry sausages by freezing it using the following guidelines: 
The specific regulations are quite complex. 
They depend on the thickness of the cuts of meat, the packaging method, and other factors. In addition there are very specific requirements as to the times in the drying rooms and the temperatures in the smoke rooms. 
While it is quite feasible for the small sausage kitchen or hobbyist to produce excellent cured dry sausages, a great deal of technical information is required. 
Alternatively, certified pork can be simply purchased.[1] 
Equipment depends on scale, a small home grinder and some basic measuring tools may be all that is required. In a larger scale commercial operation, more high volume equipment will be required. 
Regarded as the three most important pieces of equipment, regardless of the amount of sausage being made are an accurate thermometer, a calibrated scale, and a meat grinder. Smoked or smoke/cooked sausages require a smoker (small batches) or a commercial smokehouse. Emulsion-type cooked sausages, such as frankfurters or bologna, use a bowl chopper to make finely ground meat batter that is put into casings and cooked or smoked.[1] 
A variety of fresh meats may be used for making sausage, the most common are from beef, pork, lamb, chicken, turkey, and game.[1] Meat should be fresh, high quality, have the proper lean-to-fat ratio and good binding qualities. 
The meat should not be contaminated with bacteria or other microorganisms. Combining spices and seasonings in amounts that complement each other is important.[2] 
Making dry sausages involves curing salts, which contain sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate. Nitrites are used for all types of sausages and are the most common. 
Nitrates are used only in the preparation of the cured dry style of sausages. Over a period of time the nitrates are converted into nitrites by endogenous or added bacteria.[1][6] 
The human digestive system manufactures nitrites, which is thought to be what prevents botulism, which would thrive in the anaerobic conditions and temperature range of the digestive system (gut).[1] 
Cured meat products typically contain less than 40 ppm nitrites.[1] 
Potassium nitrite and potassium nitrate additions allow the production of sausages with lower levels of sodium. When using the potassium form, it is necessary to include other ingredients to mask the bitter flavours it imparts. 
Old recipes use saltpetre which is not recommended. 
The primary reason is that often these old recipes contain many times more curing ingredients than are appropriate. 
Modern techniques are readily available and do a much better job.[1] 
In the sausage industry the nitrites and nitrates are pre-formulated into products called Prague powder #1 and Prague powder #2. 
Prague powder #1 contains 6.25% sodium nitrite and 93.75% sodium chloride and is used for the preparation of all cured meats and sausages other than the dry type.[7] Prague powder #2 contains 1 ounce of sodium nitrite (6.25%) and 0.64 ounces sodium nitrate (4.0%) per pound of finished product (the remaining 14.36 ounces is sodium chloride) and is used for the preparation of cured dry sausages. 
Prague powder #2 should never be used on any product that will be fried at high temperature (e.g. bacon) because of the resulting formation of nitrosamines.[2] 
When using cure, it is very important to never exceed the recommended amount of 2.5 grams of Prague powder #1 in 1 kilogram of meat (4 ounces/100 pounds). Equivalently this is 10 mL for 4.5 kg (2 teaspoons for 10 pounds). Note that the maximum allowable amount of sodium nitrite and potassium nitrite is governed by regulations and is limited to 7 grams per 45 kg (0.25 ounces per 100 pounds) of chopped meat.[5] Since Prague powder #1 is a 1:15 dilution (in 0.45 kg of Prague powder #1 30 grams is sodium nitrite and 425 grams are common table salt), we get the proper amount at a rate of 114 grams added to 45 kg (100 lb) of meat. 
Sodium and potassium nitrite are quite toxic to humans with the lethal dose being about 4 grams. 
As little as 22 mg/kg of body weight can cause death. This is about 2.2 grams for a body mass of 100 kg. Thus, there is enough sodium nitrite in 2 ounces of Prague powder #1 to kill a person.[1] 
Morton's Tenderquick is the brand name of another formulation of sodium nitrite, with salt and sugars added. 
It is not the same concentration as either "Prague powder #1 or #2". Since certainty about the amount of nitrite present in a recipe is essential for safety, one cannot take a recipe designed for Prague powder and simply substitute like amounts of such products as Morton's Tenderquick. To do so would invite the risk of botulism poisoning. 
Similarly, one cannot just substitute Prague powder #1 in place of Morton's Tenderquick. 
For any such substitutions, one must calculate the exact amount of nitrite required and make the proper adjustments.[8] 
Note: The volume-to-weight ratio applies to the herbs and spices only. This in no way indicates the particular amount for a given recipe. 
Sausage making is sometimes looked at for being messy in the broader culture. There are common sayings such as "how the sausage gets made" to refer to a process that someone might rather not know all the gory details. This line of quotation stems from American poet John Godfrey Saxe, who said "Laws, like sausages, cease to inspire respect in proportion as we know how they are made" (1869). 
The origins of meat preservation are lost to the ages but probably began when humans began to realize the preservative value of salt.[1] Sausage making originally developed as a means to preserve and transport meat. Primitive societies learned that dried berries and spices could be added to dried meat. 
The procedure of stuffing meat into casings remains basically the same today, but sausage recipes have been greatly refined and sausage making has become a highly respected culinary art.[1] 
Sausages come in two main types: fresh and cured. Cured sausages may be either cooked or dried. Many cured sausages are smoked, but this is not mandatory. 
The curing process itself changes the meat and imparts its own flavors. An example is the difference in taste between a pork roast and a ham. 
All smoked sausages are cured. 
The reason is the threat of botulism. 
The bacterium responsible, Clostridium botulinum, is ubiquitous in the environment, grows in the anaerobic conditions created in the interior of the sausage, and thrives in the 4 °C (39 °F) to 60 °C (140 °F) temperature range common in the smoke house and subsequent ambient storage. 
Thus, for safety reasons, sausages are cured before smoking.[2]

WWE Niagara Falls was a retail store located in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. 
It was owned and operated by Canadian Niagara Hotels Inc., with its name and branding being licensed by the WWE.[1] It was the second WWE establishment to open up after The World in 1999, and the first WWE establishment to open outside of the United States.[2] After The World closed in 2003, it became the only official WWE retail store in the world. 
The venue was announced during the WrestleMania X8 fan access press conference in early 2002. 
The facility opened in July 2002[3] as part of the Clifton Hill strip in Niagara Falls. It was owned by Canadian Niagara Hotels Inc. who own the Falls Entertainment Avenue Resort. 
The venue was mainly a gift shop with WWE memorabilia and exhibitions on display, selling everything from action figures and t-shirts to books, DVDs, autographs and exclusive WWE Niagara Falls branded merchandise.[2] The store featured a drop tower attraction called The Pile Driver, based on the wrestling move, spanning 220 feet (67 m).[2] This particular attraction was open from mid-May to mid-November due to seasonal demand and climate reasons. 
The venue also featured video games and pay-per-views playing to entertain the visitors, as well as many WWE entrance themes and event music, mostly audio produced by Jim Johnston. 
During the first couple of years of operation, a sixty-minute video feed ran throughout the store, and this was available at all Canadian Niagara Hotels Inc.'s owned hotels branded as a WWE channel - used to promote the store to tourists.[4] The upstairs section of the store featured a free indoor light show in its initial years of operation. 
WWE Niagara Falls ceased operations as of March 31, 2011.[6] The store was re-opened in late 2011 as a generalized Niagara Falls gift store, though selling some miscellaneous wrestling items such as action figures and clothing. 
In 2015, the gift store was closed and the site became home to Niagara Brewing Company. 
The building was subsequently gutted and re-modelled. 
Most notably, the piledriver ride on the roof was replaced with an outside terrace for diners.[7] 
WWE Great Balls of Fire was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and WWE Network event produced by WWE. It was held exclusively for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw brand division. 
The event took place on July 9, 2017, at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas. The event's title referenced Jerry Lee Lewis' song of the same name, which was used as the event's theme song. 
It was a one-off event by WWE, as following WrestleMania 34 the following year, brand-exclusive PPVs were discontinued, resulting in WWE reducing the amount of yearly PPVs produced. 
Nine matches were contested at the event, including one on the Kickoff pre-show. In the main event, Brock Lesnar defeated Samoa Joe to retain the Universal Championship. 
On the undercard, Braun Strowman defeated Roman Reigns in an ambulance match, Cesaro and Sheamus retained the Raw Tag Team Championship against The Hardy Boyz (Jeff Hardy and Matt Hardy) in a 30-minute Iron Man match, and in the opening bout, Bray Wyatt defeated Seth Rollins. 
During the Great Balls of Fire Kickoff pre-show, Neville defended the WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Akira Tozawa (with Titus O'Neil). In the end, Neville performed a Spinning Back Kick on Tozawa to retain the title.[26] 
After that, Cesaro and Sheamus defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against The Hardy Boyz in a 30-minute Iron Man match. 
At the start of the match, after Cesaro distracted Matt, Sheamus performed a "Brogue Kick" on Matt to make the score 1–0. 
Sheamus and Cesaro performed a "White Noise/Diving Neckbreaker" combination on Jeff to advance the score to 2–0. 
Jeff performed a "Twist of Fate" on Cesaro to make the score 2–1. 
After Cesaro threw Matt into the ring post, causing him to bleed, Matt was counted out, making the score 3–1. 
With the aid of Matt, Jeff pinned Cesaro with a split-legged pin to make the score 3–2. 
Matt performed a Super "Twist of Fate" on Sheamus to even the score 3–3. Thinking Sheamus was the legal man, Jeff performed a "Swanton Bomb" on him, but was quickly pinned by Cesaro, who was the legal man, to make the score 4–3. Jeff performed a "Twist of Fate" on Cesaro, but during the pin, the time-limit expired, meaning Cesaro and Sheamus retained the titles.[27] 
Later, Alexa Bliss defended the Raw Women's Championship against Sasha Banks. Banks applied the "Bank Statement" but Bliss touched the ring rope. Bliss was then counted out, meaning Banks won the match, but Bliss retained the title. 
After the match, Banks fought with Bliss on the stage and performed a "Meteora" on Bliss off the English announce table.[27] 
Roman Reigns' post-match attack on Braun Strowman was widely described as attempted murder.[29][30][31][32] The following day, it was reported that Strowman was in the care of his personal physician, but the severity of his injuries were undisclosed.[33] 
In 2017, WWE scheduled Great Balls of Fire as a new pay-per-view (PPV) and WWE Network event to be held on July 9 from the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas. To coincide with the brand extension that was reintroduced in July 2016, in which the promotion again splits its main roster between the Raw and SmackDown brands where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform,[1] Great Balls of Fire exclusively featured wrestlers from the Raw brand.[2] 
The event's title referenced Jerry Lee Lewis' song of the same name, which was ultimately used as the event's theme song. 
WWE Hall of Famer Jerry Lawler stated that his personal attorney, who also represented Lewis, had asked him about pursuing legal action over the title, but that he "called them and got everything worked out," including securing rights to use the song itself as part of the event.[3] The name received negative criticism on social media.[4] 
The card included nine matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw brand.[5][6] Storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows Monday Night Raw and 205 Live, the latter of which is cruiserweight-exclusive.[7] 
A Yout (Old Norse Yūt) is a type of fairy in Finnish folklore. It is a gnome type sprite that inhabit trees. They are said to be mischievous beings that lead travelers astray and bring bad luck to those who intend to harm the forests they dwell in. 
The etymology of Yout is contested. 
Scholars have proposed varying theories about its origins, including that it may have originated as spirits associated with death, or as a mixture of concepts. The modern spelling may also be a take on the British back slang yob due to the similar characterizations. 
The first clear mention of a yout was in the early 17th century when Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden began collecting various folklore from his kingdom. 
This also included the Swedish speaking parts of Finland. 
Some have suggested that there is even evidence of youts in the Poetic Edda; however, this claim is largely dismissed by most scholars.[1][2][3]

The Tipos Extraliga season is divided into a regular season from late September through the beginning of March, when teams play against each other in a pre-defined schedule, and playoffs from March to April, which is an elimination tournament at which two teams play against each other to win the best-of-seven series in order to advance to the next round. The winner of playoffs is crowned the Slovak champion, (Slovenský majster in Slovak) and receives the Vladimir Dzurilla Trophy. 
The regular season is a round-robin, where each team plays 50 games. Three points are awarded for winning in regulation time, two points for winning in overtime or a shootout, one point for losing in overtime or a shootout, and zero points for losing in regulation time. At the end of the regular season, the team that finishes with the most points is crowned the league champion. 
The six highest-ranked teams by points qualify directly for the playoffs. The four teams ranked 7–10 play a best-of-five series and battle for the two remaining playoffs spots. 
The lowest ranked team after the regular season plays in a relegation series called Play-Out against the best team from the second tier league Slovak 1. 
Liga. The two teams battle to win a best-of-seven series of Play-Out to qualify for the next Tipos Extraliga season. Before the 2018–19 season, the eight highest-ranked teams qualified for the playoffs.[1] 
The Tipos Extraliga (Slovak Extraliga) is the highest-level ice hockey league in Slovakia. From the 2018–19 season to the 2020–21 season, the league included two or one team from Hungary.[1] In 2009, it was ranked by the IIHF as the fifth strongest league in Europe and in 2012, it was ranked by The Hockey News as the sixth-strongest league in the world behind the NHL, KHL, Swedish Hockey League, SM-liiga and Czech Extraliga.[2] However, it has dropped significantly since then, with the American Hockey League, Swiss National League and German DEL, among others, all now ranked higher. 
The name of the league is leased to sponsors and changes frequently. 
From 1993/94 to 1997/98, it was called Extraliga, then the name changed to West Extraliga until the end of the 2000/01 season. In 2001/02, its name was Boss Extraliga. 
From the 2002/03 season to 2004/05, the name was ST Extraliga and in 2005/06 to T-Com Extraliga. On 16 January 2007, the name changed to Slovnaft Extraliga when a general sponsorship agreement with Slovnaft was signed, in 2011/12 it became the Tipsport Extraliga and Slovnaft Play-off, and since the 2015/16 season until the 2019/2020 season it was called the Tipsport liga and Slovnaft Play-off. The current name is Tipos Extraliga. 
Every regular season game is composed of three 20-minute periods, with an intermission of a maximum of 18 minutes between periods.[3] If the game is tied following the 60-minute regulation time, a five-minute three-on-three sudden death overtime period is played. If a game is still tied after the overtime, a shootout decides the winner of the game. In a shootout, the team that scores the most penalty shots out of five attempts wins the game. 
If a game is still tied after five penalty-shot rounds, the shootout continues round by round, until one team scores while the other team fails to score. 
Several former New Zealand Prime Ministers have criticized the speech in the time since its delivery. Jim Bolger said in an interview published in 2017 it was in the same "frame" as Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, and that "some people follow absurdities". Ex Prime Minister Helen Clark (Labour) said of Brash's motives that "he would’ve done a lot of opinion polling on that, and knew it would strike a chord".[7] 
Brash returned to Orewa on 25 January 2005, hoping to capitalise on the previous year's success, and gave a speech on social welfare and on welfare dependency. This speech, dubbed Orewa 2, failed to generate the publicity of the original. The speech also caused the removal of National's social-welfare spokesperson Katherine Rich, because she failed to endorse it. 
The Orewa Speech was a speech delivered by the then-leader of the New Zealand National Party Don Brash to the Orewa Rotary Club on 27 January 2004. It addressed the theme of race relations in New Zealand and in particular the special status of Māori people. Brash approached the once-taboo subject by advocating 'one rule for all'[1] and ending what he saw as the Māori's special privileges. 
Brash covered many aspects of Māori-Pākehā relations in his speech. 
He criticized policies he believed to be separatist, such as required levels of iwi representation on district health boards and the allocation of Māori electorate seats in Parliament – something he labelled an "anachronism". The speech made particular reference to the Labour Party's stance on the Foreshore and Seabed Act, which Brash disagreed with. He also questioned the use of Māori spiritual traditions in official events and the open-ended nature of the treaty settlement process.[2] 
The speech resulted in a major surge for the National Party, which had been languishing from an overwhelming defeat at the 2002 election. From 28% in the polls a month before the speech, the National Party jumped to 45% two weeks after it: ten points ahead of Labour.[5] 
Polls showed that many Māori were comfortable with Brash's speech, and the National Party threw its support behind it, but Georgina te Heuheu was removed as National's Māori Affairs spokeswoman after criticising it.[6] It was instrumental in establishing a public profile for Don Brash, who had only recently become the party's leader. 
Subsequent to the speech, Brash's catch-cry "need not race" was taken up by the other side of the political divide, the governing Labour-Progressive coalition. An audit of government programmes was put in place to determine whether there were race-based programmes where need-based programmes would suffice.

Rudo (Serbian Cyrillic: Рудо) is a town and municipality located in Republika Srpska, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As of 2013, it has a population of 7,963 inhabitants, while the town of Rudo has a population of 1,949 inhabitants. 
It is famous throughout former Yugoslav republics as the birthplace of the 1st Proletarian Brigade formed by Yugoslav Partisans. 
The town of Rudo was established in 1555 by Sokollu Mustafa Pasha, a close relative of Ottoman Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha.[1] A stone mosque, bridge over the Lim, hamam, inn, mekteb (school), tekke, some shops and houses were built.[1] It was mentioned by Evliya Çelebi (1611–1682).[1] It was flooded in 1896, and then expanded into an urban settlement.[2] Following the collapse of the Republic of Užice and the time spent in the village of Drenova leader of Yugoslav Partisans arrived to Rudo on 21 December 1941.[3] The 1st Proletarian Brigade of the Yugoslav Partisans was established in Rudo on 22 December 1941.[2] A monument dedicated to the Brigade was erected in 1961,[2] with a museum subsequently being opened a decade later. 
Personalities 
XEW-AM is a radio station in Mexico City, Mexico, broadcasting on the AM frequency of 900 kHz; it is branded as W Radio. XEW-AM serves as the originating station for other "W-Radio" stations around Mexico that carry some of its programs. 
The programming on XEW-AM is also simulcast on Mexico City FM radio station 96.9 XEW-FM. 
XEW began regular broadcasts at 20:00 CST on September 18, 1930. Broadcasting from a room (later to become a proper studio) at the Olympia Cinema on 16 September Street in Mexico City, it initially had only 5 kW of transmitter power, although this was increased to 50 kW by 1934. With the installation of new transmitters, the power became 250 kW by 1935 and remained there for more than 80 years, making XEW-AM the most powerful AM radio station in North America.[citation needed] On February 10, 2016, XEW-AM was approved to relocate its transmitter to a site in Los Reyes Acaquilpan, La Paz Municipality, in the State of Mexico and to reduce power to 100,000 watts.[1] 
XEW-AM originally was affiliated with the NBC Radio Networks (NBC and Blue); its future sister stations would take affiliation with rival networks, XEQ-AM with CBS and XEX-AM with Mutual. As radio in Mexico evolved with the country's growth and more radio stations signed on, XEW-AM became flagship to the country's largest radio network. Several radio and television stations have derived their call signs from XEW radio and television, all of them affiliated at one time or another with Televisa.[citation needed] 
The FM frequency, 96.9, received its concession on April 28, 1962; it was not launched until the 1970s, and by the end of that decade, it carried a disco format. By 1981, it had changed to "Rock Stereo". 
On September 9, 1985, it was renamed "WFM" with an English rock and pop format, being the direct competition of XHSON-FM (then known as "Rock 101"). Among the DJs that conformed the station were Alejandro González Iñárritu, Martha Debayle and Charo Fernández. 
After 14 years, in 1999, the station changed its name and format to "W Radical", directed by the former head of "Rock 101", Luis Gerardo Salas, airing electronic music and eurodance. By 2001, it returned to its former WFM format with the slogan "Frecuencia Adictiva", but in late 2002, after the association of Televisa Radio and PRISA, it was decided to simulcast the same programming on AM and FM, and thus XEW-FM became a news and talk outlet, albeit musical programming can still be heard on overnights and weekends when there are not sports scheduled. 
On October 12, 2018, West arrived in Uganda and restarted work on the album in a dome-shaped studio set up in the Chobe Safari Lodge at the Murchison Falls National Park.[29] West arrived with around 50 people and recorded for five days.[30] He played new music, including a studio recording of the "We Got Love" remix, for a group of about 100 Ugandan school children during a charity event.[31] In an October 21, 2018 interview, American rapper Quavo stated that his trio Migos had recorded for the album.[32] In November 2018, following a Kids See Ghosts performance with Kid Cudi at American rapper Tyler, the Creator's Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival, West tweeted that he felt Yandhi was not finished, and that he would "announce the release date once it's done," delaying the album indefinitely.[33] 
Jesus Is King is the ninth studio album by American rapper Kanye West. It was released on October 25, 2019, through GOOD Music and distributed by Def Jam Recordings. The album follows a Christian theme, different from his usual work. 
West described it as "an expression of the gospel". It features guest appearances from Clipse, Ty Dolla Sign, Kenny G, Fred Hammond, Ant Clemons, and the Sunday Service Choir. Production is included from West, Federico Vindver, Angel Lopez, BoogzDaBeast, and Timbaland, among others. 
West began recording the album in August 2018, originally announcing it as Yandhi. The album missed two initial release dates in September and November 2018 under the original title, before being delayed indefinitely due to leaks. West had formed his gospel group the Sunday Service Choir in January 2019, performing gospel songs and covers of songs from West's discography. 
The song "Water" was performed live prior to release by the group. In August 2019, Yandhi was reannounced as Jesus Is King, but it missed two planned release dates for late September 2019 under the new title. 
The final release of Jesus Is King was simultaneous with that of a concert film of the same name, which included a number of the tracks as part of the soundtrack. The singles "Follow God" and "Closed on Sunday" were both released in November 2019, charting in the top 20 of the US Billboard Hot 100. The album received mixed reviews from music critics, with a number of them drawing comparisons between it and West's previous solo album, Ye (2018). 
Jesus Is King won the Top Christian Album and Top Gospel Album awards at the 2020 Billboard Music Awards and Best Contemporary Christian Music Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2021. It stood as West's record-tying ninth consecutive album to debut atop the US Billboard 200. In addition, West broke several Billboard charts' records. 
The album was a chart topper in nine other countries, including Australia and Canada, while attaining top five positions in the Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. It has been certified gold and silver in the United States and the UK by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and British Phonographic Industry (BPI), respectively. A companion album, Jesus Is Born, was released in December 2019 by the Sunday Service Choir. 
Throughout May and June 2018, five seven-track albums produced by West at his ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming were successively released as the Wyoming Sessions. American rapper Pusha T's third studio album Daytona was released first, followed by West's eighth studio album Ye, West's collaborative studio album Kids See Ghosts, with American rapper Kid Cudi as Kids See Ghosts, American rapper Nas' twelfth studio album Nasir, and American singer Teyana Taylor's second studio album K.T.S.E.; all of the albums were released in 2018.

Suzanne Marie Somers (née Mahoney; born October 16, 1946) is an American actress, author, singer, businesswoman, and health spokesperson. She appeared in the television role of Chrissy Snow on Three's Company and as Carol Foster Lambert on Step by Step. 
On January 9, 2007, the Associated Press reported that a wildfire in Southern California had destroyed Somers' Malibu home.[12] 
Somers later became the author of a series of self-help books, including Ageless: The Naked Truth About Bioidentical Hormones (2006), about bioidentical hormone replacement therapy.[1] She has released two autobiographies, four diet books, and a book of poetry. 
Somers has been criticized for her views on some medical subjects and her advocacy of the Wiley Protocol, which has been labelled as "scientifically unproven and dangerous".[2][2] Her promotion of alternative cancer treatments has received criticism from the American Cancer Society.[3] 
Born Suzanne Marie Mahoney in San Bruno, California, Somers was the third of four children in an Irish-American Catholic family.[5][6][7] Her mother, Marion Elizabeth (née Turner), was a medical secretary, and her father, Francis Mahoney, was a laborer and gardener. When Suzanne was six years old her father became an alcoholic. Somers's father would call her names and embarrass her.[8] 
Somers attended Capuchino High School[9] She also said she was a cheerleader at Mercy High School in Burlingame, California, and was accepted at San Francisco College for Women, a college run by the Catholic Society of the Sacred Heart order. Somers married Bruce Somers in 1965, when she was 19, and they had a son, Bruce Jr., in November 1965. 
That marriage ended in 1968. 
Somers has three granddaughters, Camelia, Violet and Daisy Hamel-Buffa.[10] 
Somers was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer in April 2000, and had a lumpectomy to remove the cancer followed by radiation therapy, but decided to forgo chemotherapy in favor of a fermented mistletoe extract called Iscador.[11] 
Capuchino High School is a public high school in San Bruno, California, United States. The school is surrounded by the city of Millbrae on all but one corner. It is one of seven high schools in the San Mateo Union High School District, a division of the San Mateo County Office of Education. 
SMUHSD residents approved Measure D in November 2000, which authorized funding for school renovation and modernization. Capuchino has a renovated science wing, a new spirit court and cafeteria building, and several new classrooms adjoining the new administration building. 
Measure M funds were approved by SMUHSD voters in 2006 which in part funded the construction of a new humanities, arts, and sciences building (HASB) and theater remodel. In April 2012 the new HASB was completed and students moved in to finish their school year.[6] 
The school has long been known for its music and drama programs.[citation needed] 
Ralph Bredenberg (1918–2009)[7][8] became the band director in 1953 and built an outstanding marching band that performed at numerous competitions, as well as appearing at the Tournament of Roses in Pasadena, California and the nationally televised inaugural parade for John F. Kennedy in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1961.[9][verification needed] 
Capuchino's rival is Mills High School in Millbrae. 
Capuchino has long had an outstanding athletic department. It initially competed in the Peninsula Athletic League, which stretched from Jefferson High School in Daly City to Lincoln High School in San Jose. 
As more high schools were built during the 1950s and early 1960s, the Mid-Peninsula was established to include the seven high schools of the San Mateo Union High School District. Capuchino dominated league competition over the years, especially in football, basketball, swimming, wrestling, track, and tennis. During the late 1950s the school won the league championships in varsity football, basketball, and baseball, a time often referred to as "The Golden Age of Sports."[15][unreliable source][citation needed] Capuchino baseball players Wally Bunker and Keith Hernandez both went on to careers in Major League Baseball.[16][verification needed] 
In the 1990s, Capuchino's girls' softball team won five consecutive Central Coast Section (CCS) Championships (1993–1997),[17] and was state ranked on three occasions during this period. Capuchino also has a 32-9 Central Coast Section Playoff record, giving it the second best winning percentage of all schools in the section. 
The school also offers ROP (Regional Occupational Program) classes for free. These include CompTIA A+ Certification (or computer system design), CCNA certification (Cisco Networking Academy), and an advanced Art of Video lab.

The physical campus, which is just over 34 acres (140,000 m2) in size, was formerly the Spanish Rancho del Capuchino.[2] The school opened in September 1950. 
There was initially only one two-story building on the campus; by 1953 most of the campus was completed. A 1,000-seat auditorium was built in 1959, supplementing the school's little theatre. In the 1961–62 academic year, just prior to the completion of Crestmoor High School, student enrollment exceeded 1,800 and almost every available space was utilized for classrooms.[3][verification needed] 
In 1963, KPIX (Channel 5) filmed scenes, including a pep rally, at the school for its weekly High School Salute program. Host Dick Stewart also interviewed students and faculty in the KPIX studios during the telecast.

Millbrae is a city located in northern San Mateo County, California, United States. To its northeast is San Francisco International Airport, San Bruno is on its northwest, and Burlingame on its southeast. It is bordered by San Andreas Lake to the southwest. 
The Ohlone people have been living in the Bay Area for hundreds of years. 
The closest villages to what is now Millbrae were located by the banks of San Bruno Creek, and they are known as Urebure and Siplichiquin.[8][9] A third nearby village—whose original name is unknown—is called CA-SMA-299. The local Ohlone people are today called the Ramaytush Ohlone, however this name is a linguistic designation that arose relatively recently. 
Prior to colonization, the Ohlone did not operate as a single consolidated unit; they identified more with their local tribe and village than with the nation at large. The several local tribes that lived in the area prior to colonization coalesced into the modern Ramaytush people following the precipitous decline of their population in the 1800s.[10] 
In 1827, sub lieutenant José Antonio Sánchez, who was stationed at the Presidio, was granted permission by Mexican governor José María de Echeandía to occupy the rancho for “grazing and agricultural purposes”, as grazing land for Mission Dolores and the Presidio of San Francisco.[11] The original Sixteen Mile House, a historical restaurant and rest stop, was a direct link to Millbrae's early days. The rest stop was built in 1872 by members of the Sánchez family, the original landholders of the Rancho Buri Buri, which at one time comprised parts of present-day Millbrae and Burlingame. 
The mythology of the Ohlone (Costanoan) Native American people of Northern California include creation myths as well as other ancient narratives that contain elements of their spiritual and philosophical belief systems, and their conception of the world order. Their myths describe supernatural anthropomorphic beings with the names of regional birds and animals, notably the eagle, the Coyote who is humanity's ancestor and a trickster spirit, and a hummingbird. 
The Chochenyo myths describe the "First People" or "Early People" as supernatural anthropomorphic beings with the names of regional birds and animals. Of the fragmented myths that are recorded, the Coyote was the supreme being: 
Coyote was the grandfather, companion and advisor to the Chochenyo's mythical hero, the Kaknu. Kaknu was another anthropomorphic being, described to be like a predatory bird, most closely resembling a peregrine falcon.[4] 
"Finally when Kaknu didn't want to fight anymore with anyone, he turned into a dove and entered into the earth". Kaknu dived into the earth by folding his wings, and went to confront the "Body of Stone" called Wiwe. Body of Stone was the underground lord of the earth, described as a man with a stone body, who fed people to his servants. 
The Body of Stone held many of Kaknu's "people" in captivity and they assisted Kaknu in an epic battle. When Kaknu shot the Body of Stone in the neck and navel with all his arrows, the Body of Stone died and burst into pieces, and became all the rocks scattered across the world. Kaknu makes peace with the people in this once hostile underground.[5] 
According to the Chochenyo, death was created by Coyote so that people would have enough to eat, but this meant. "Kaknu had to take the road to the land of the dead...the people followed his example."[1] 
The Chochenyo (Chocheño) mythology of the San Francisco Bay Area has a strong culture hero figure named Kaknu, coyote's grandson, who is an anthropomorphic and closely resembles a peregrine falcon. 
According to the Chochenyo, the Land of the Dead had only one road and a man who receives the incoming spirits. There is white foam like the sea, before this are two pieces of smoking and burning wood and two hollowed stones, one filled with water, and the other with a sugary substance, where the spirits can drink and eat, before they plunge into the foam. The burning wood is a warning, the type of warning not elaborated.[6] 
These myths have been called incomplete story fragments on the creation of the world. 
They share some elements with the neighboring people in Central and Northern California, such as Miwok mythology. The Bay Miwok people also believed that the world started with water surrounding the tallest mountain in the region, Mount Diablo. The Ohlone myths contain numerous similarities to Yokuts mythology and cosmogony.[7]

One Ohlone creation myth begins with the demise of a previous world: When it was destroyed, the world was covered entirely in water, apart from a single peak, Pico Blanco (north of Big Sur) in the Rumsien version (or Mount Diablo in the northern Ohlone's version) on which Coyote, Hummingbird, and Eagle stood. "When the water rose to their feet" the eagle carried them all to Sierra de Gabilin (near Fremont) where they waited "for the water to go down" and the world to dry out. Coyote was sent to investigate and found it was dry now.[1] 
After the flood, the eagle led Coyote to a beautiful girl inside or in the river and instructed him "she will be your wife in order that people may be raised again." Eagle gave Coyote instruction how to make her pregnant in her belly. This first wife became pregnant by eating one of Coyote's lice, but she was afraid and started running. 
Coyote could not persuade her or slow her down, she ran to the ocean with Coyote chasing her and she jumped into the ocean and turned into a sand flea or shrimp.[2] 
Coyote married a second wife and this time had children who became the Ohlone people. 
This is how "people raised again". The Coyote taught humanity the arts of survival.

Established as a California Community College in 1965 following voter approval, Ohlone College serves the cities of Fremont and Newark and parts of Union City in the southeast region of the San Francisco Bay area. The Ohlone Community College District is a single college district with two campuses and a thriving e-campus. 
Officially named Ohlone College on June 18, 1967, the institution's name honors the Ohlone people, whose unceded lands include the Fremont and Newark area that the school was founded, as well as much of the surrounding San Francisco Bay area, that the Ohlone people stewarded for hundreds of years prior to the arrival of Europeans.[2][3] 
A Board of Trustees was elected in 1966, which then hired the founding president, Dr. Stephen Epler, in June 1966.[4] The college opened in fall 1967 at the Serra Center, a temporary site on Washington Boulevard.[5] Eventually the college went out to the community for a $10 million bond and in 1972 began construction of the new Ohlone College campus on Mission Boulevard in Fremont. 
Ernest J. Kump designed the original nine buildings that make up the academic village. Buildings added later to the campus include the performing arts center, the technology center, the child development center and the student services center. 
A second campus was constructed in Newark, CA, The Ohlone College Newark Center for Health Sciences and Technology, which opened in 2008. 
Including Dr. Epler, Ohlone has had only seven presidents in its 45+ year history. The current president is Dr. Eric Bishop. 
A box grater with multiple grating surfaces 
Graters produce shreds that are thinner at the ends than the middle. 
This allows the grated material to melt or cook in a different manner than the shreds of mostly uniform thickness produced by the grating blade of a food processor. 
Hand-grated potatoes, for example, melt together more easily in a potato pancake than food-processed potato shreds. 
In music 
In Jamaica and Belize, coconut graters are used as a traditional musical instrument[1] (along with drums, fife, and other instruments) in the performance of kumina, jonkanoo, and sometimes mento. 
History 
The modern cheese grater was invented in France in the 1540s by François Boullier. 
His pewter design was intended to convert hard cheeses into something more edible.[2] 
Variants 
Spiralizers are complex food-processing machines with grater-like mechanisms. 
These mechanisms rotate by the turn of a cluster to produce ribbons or noodles.

Comedian Mitch Hedberg performed a joke in which he stated that the negative name of cheese grater would be "a sponge ruiner".[3] Kevin Eastman, co-creator of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, got the idea for the Shredder's armor from large cheese graters which he envisioned on a villainous character's arms to be used as weapons. 
Originally called "Grate Man", the Shredder is known as the primary antagonist in the TMNT franchise.[4] Wisconsin sports fans are often called cheeseheads, and some wear cheese hats. 
In 2013, sports fans of Chicago and Minnesota replied to their rivals by wearing cheese graters.[5]

A grater, also known as a shredder, is a kitchen utensil used to grate foods into fine pieces. 
The modern grater was invented by François Boullier in the 1540s, originally to grate cheese. 
Uses 
Cheese grater 
Several types of graters feature different sizes of grating slots, and can therefore aid in the preparation of a variety of foods. 
They are commonly used to grate cheese and lemon or orange peel (to create zest), and can also be used to grate other soft foods. 
They are commonly used in the preparation of toasted cheese, Welsh rarebit, egg salad, and dishes which contain cheese sauce such as macaroni and cheese, cauliflower cheese. 
In Slavic cuisine, graters are commonly used to grate potatoes for preparation of dishes, including draniki, bramborak or potato babka. 
In tropical countries graters are also used to grate coconut meat. 
In the Indian subcontinent, the grater is used for preparation of a popular dessert, Gajar Ka Halwa. 
Sand sharks Temporal range: Upper Cretaceous–recent[1] PreꞒ Ꞓ O S D C P T J K Pg N Sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus) Scientific classification Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Chondrichthyes Superorder: Selachimorpha Order: Lamniformes Family: Odontaspididae J. P. Müller & Henle, 1839 
The sand shark has a unique hunting strategy. 
It is able to gulp air from above the surface and collect the air in its stomach. 
This enables it to become buoyant and approach its prey virtually motionless. 
During the day, the sand shark stays mostly inactive, but at night, it becomes active and resumes hunting activities.[5] Its staple is small fish, but it eats crustaceans and squid, as well. 
It occasionally hunts in shivers (groups), and has even been known to attack full fishing nets. 
Reproduction 
Sand sharks only develop two embryos, one in each uterus. 
The largest and strongest embryos consume their siblings in the womb (intrauterine cannibalism) before each surviving pup is born.[6] It has one of the lowest reproduction rates of all sharks and is susceptible to even minimal population pressure, so it is listed as vulnerable and is protected in much of its range.[7] 
Sand sharks are not known to attack humans. 
If a person were to provoke a sand shark, it may retaliate defensively. 
Sand sharks are generally not aggressive, but harass divers who are spearfishing. 
In North America, wreck divers regularly visit the World War II shipwrecks to dive with the sharks that make the wrecks their home.[8] 
Conservation 
A recent report from the PEW Charitable Trusts suggests a new management approach used for large mammals that have suffered population declines could hold promise for sharks. 
Because of the life-history characteristics of sharks, conventional fisheries management approaches, such as reaching maximum sustainable yield, may not be sufficient to rebuild depleted shark populations. 
Some of the more stringent approaches used to reverse declines in large mammals may be appropriate for sharks, including prohibitions on the retention of the most vulnerable species and regulation of international trade.[9] 
Species 
Teeth of Synodontaspis gracilis 
The family contains three extant species, in two genera, as well as many extinct species in several genera. 
Recent mitochondrial DNA analysis of extant members has found the two extant members do not actually form a monophyletic clade. 
This family is therefore polyphyletic and in need of revision.[10] 
Vulnerable (VU) species are considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.

Sand sharks, also known as sand tiger sharks, grey nurse sharks or ragged tooth sharks, are mackerel sharks of the family Odontaspididae. 
They are found worldwide in temperate and tropical waters. 
The three species are in two genera. 
The long, narrow and sharp teeth of Odontaspididae (here Odontaspis ferox). 
The body tends to be brown with dark markings in the upper half. 
These markings disappear as they mature. 
Their needle-like teeth are highly adapted for impaling fish, their main prey. 
Their teeth are long, narrow, and very sharp with smooth edges, with one and on occasion two smaller cusplets on either side.[2] Sand sharks have a large second dorsal fin.[1] The sand shark can grow up to 3.2 m (10 ft) long, and most adults can weigh around 200 kg (440 lb). 
The average lifespan of both sexes is only about 7 years, though they may live longer in captivity. 
Location and origins 
The name sand shark comes from their tendency to migrate towards shoreline habitats, and they are often seen swimming around the ocean floor in the surf zone; at times, they come very close to shore. 
They are often found in warm or temperate waters throughout the world's oceans, except the eastern Pacific.[3] They also frequent the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas at depths from 20 to 200 m (66 to 656 ft) and sometimes more.[4] 
The Mandelbrot Set, the boundary of which is a fractal with a topological dimension of 1 and a Hausdorff dimension of 2

Zoom-in of the boundary of the Mandelbrot Set 
In mathematics, a fractal is a subset of Euclidean space with a fractal dimension that strictly exceeds its topological dimension. 
Fractals appear the same at different scales, as illustrated in successive magnifications of the Mandelbrot set.[1][2][3][4] Fractals often exhibit similar patterns at increasingly smaller scales, a property called self-similarity, also known as expanding symmetry or unfolding symmetry; if this replication is exactly the same at every scale, as in the Menger sponge,[5] it is called affine self-similar. 
Fractal geometry lies within the mathematical branch of measure theory. 
Geometry (from the Ancient Greek: γεωμετρία; geo- "earth", -metron "measurement") is, with arithmetic, one of the oldest branches of mathematics. 
It is concerned with properties of space that are related with distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures.[1] A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer. 
The International Space Station orbits Earth once about every 92 minutes, flying at about 250 miles (400 km) above sea level. 
Two bodies of different masses orbiting a common barycenter. 
The relative sizes and type of orbit are similar to the Pluto–Charon system. 
In celestial mechanics, an orbit is the curved trajectory of an object[1] such as the trajectory of a planet around a star, or of a natural satellite around a planet, or of an artificial satellite around an object or position in space such as a planet, moon, asteroid, or Lagrange point. 
In an atom, electrons follow similar curved paths, or orbits, around a nucleus. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating trajectory, although it may also refer to a non-repeating trajectory. 
To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptic orbits, with the center of mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse,[2] as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.

The supermassive black hole at the core of supergiant elliptical galaxy Messier 87, with a mass about 7 billion times that of the Sun,[1] as depicted in the first false-colour image in radio waves released by the Event Horizon Telescope (10 April 2019).[2][3][4][5] Visible are the crescent-shaped emission ring and central shadow,[6] which are gravitationally magnified views of the black hole's photon ring and the photon capture zone of its event horizon. The crescent shape arises from the black hole's rotation and relativistic beaming; the shadow is about 2.6 times the diameter of the event horizon.[3] 
Animated simulation of a Schwarzschild black hole with a galaxy passing behind in a plane perpendicular to the line-of-sight. Around and at the time of exact alignment (syzygy), extreme gravitational lensing of the galaxy by the black hole is observed. 
A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing — no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light — can escape from it.[7] The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.[8][9] The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. 
Although it has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[10] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[11][12] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. Unfortunately, this temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.

Ledumahadi (meaning "a giant thunderclap" in Sesotho language) is a genus of lessemsaurid sauropodomorph dinosaur from the Early Jurassic Elliot Formation in Free State Province, South Africa.[1] The type and only species is L. mafube,[1][2] known from a singular incomplete postcranial specimen. A quadruped, it was one of the first giant sauropodomorphs, reaching a weight of around 12 tonnes (26,000 lb), despite not having evolved columnar limbs like its later huge relatives.[1]

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional men's Twenty20 cricket league, contested by ten teams based out of ten Indian cities.[1] The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007. 
It is usually held between March and May of every year and has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme.[2] 
The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 was ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues.[3] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast live on YouTube.[4][5] The brand value of the IPL in 2019 was ₹47,500 crore (US$6.3 billion), according to Duff & Phelps.[6] According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$150 million) to the GDP of the Indian economy.[7] The 2020 IPL season set a massive viewership record with 31.57 million average impressions and with an overall consumption increase of 23 per cent from the 2019 season. 
There have been fourteen seasons of the IPL tournament. 
The current IPL title holders are the Chennai Super Kings, winning the 2021 season.[8] The venue for the 2020 season was moved due to the COVID-19 pandemic and games were played in the United Arab Emirates.[9][10]

Gymnothorax favagineus is a large moray which can reach a maximum length of 300 cm, but specimens usually encountered are much smaller.[2] Its serpentine in shape body has a white to yellowish background color dotted with numerous black spots which latter vary in size and shape depending on the individual and on the environment in which the animals live.[3] Therefore, morays living on a reef with clear water will have less black spots than those of a turbid environment.[4] It is from this characteristic color pattern that ensue its vernacular names. 
Distribution and habitat 
The laced moray is widespread throughout the Indo-West Pacific area from eastern coast of Africa, Red Sea included, until Papua New Guinea and from south Japan to the Great Barrier Reef.[5][6] 
It lives on the outer slopes of coral reefs. 
During the day, it sits sheltered in crevices between 3.3 and 148.5 feet (1 and 45 meters) deep.[7] 
Biology 
The laced moray is carnivorous. 
It leaves its lair at night to actively hunt its prey along the reef. 
It feeds mainly on small fish and cephalopods.[8] Large adults are prone to be aggressive in the wild.[9]

On the other hand, other consonants are often silent when they precede an ⟨n⟩ at the beginning of an English word. Examples include gnome, knife, mnemonic, and pneumonia. 
In mathematics, the italic form n is a particularly common symbol for a variable quantity which represents a natural number. The set of natural numbers is referred to as N . {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} .} 
N, or n, is the fourteenth letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet. Its name in English is en (pronounced /ˈɛn/), plural ens.[1] 
One of the most common hieroglyphs, snake, was used in Egyptian writing to stand for a sound like the English ⟨J⟩, because the Egyptian word for "snake" was djet. It is speculated by many[who?] that Semitic people working in Egypt adapted hieroglyphics to create the first alphabet, and that they used the same snake symbol to represent N, because their word for "snake" may have begun with that sound. However, the name for the letter in the Phoenician, Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic alphabets is nun, which means "fish" in some of these languages. 
⟨n⟩ represents a dental or alveolar nasal in virtually all languages that use the Latin alphabet, and in the International Phonetic Alphabet. A common digraph with ⟨n⟩ is ⟨ng⟩, which represents a velar nasal in a variety of languages, usually positioned word-finally in English.[1][2] Often, before a velar plosive (as in ink or jungle), ⟨n⟩ alone represents a velar nasal. In Italian and French, ⟨gn⟩ represents a palatal nasal /ɲ/. 
Doctrine (from Latin: doctrina, meaning "teaching, instruction") is a codification of beliefs or a body of teachings or instructions, taught principles or positions, as the essence of teachings in a given branch of knowledge or in a belief system. The etymological Greek analogue is "catechism".[1] 
Often the word doctrine specifically suggests a body of religious principles as promulgated by a church. Doctrine may also refer to a principle of law, in the common-law traditions, established through a history of past decisions. 
The term also applies to the concept of an established procedure to a complex operation in warfare. The typical example is tactical doctrine in which a standard set of maneuvers, kinds of troops and weapons are employed as a default approach to a kind of attack. 
Almost every military organization has its own doctrine, sometimes written, sometimes unwritten. Some military doctrines are transmitted through training programs. More recently, in modern peacekeeping operations, which involve both civilian and military operations, more comprehensive (not just military) doctrines are now emerging such as the 2008 United Nations peacekeeping operations' "Capstone Doctrine"[11] which speaks to integrated civilian and military operations. 
By definition, political doctrine is "[a] policy, position or principle advocated, taught or put into effect concerning the acquisition and exercise of the power to govern or administrate in society."[12] The term political doctrine is sometimes wrongly identified with political ideology. 
However, doctrine lacks the actional aspect of ideology. It is mainly a theoretical discourse, which "refers to a coherent sum of assertions regarding what a particular topic should be" (Bernard Crick). Political doctrine is based on a rationally elaborated set of values, which may precede the formation of a political identity per se. 
It is concerned with philosophical orientations on a meta-theoretical level.[13] 
A legal doctrine is a body of interrelated rules (usually of common law and built over a long period of time) associated with a legal concept or principle. For example, the doctrine of frustration of purpose now has many tests and rules applicable with regards to each other and can be contained within a "bubble" of frustration. In a court session a defendant may refer to the doctrine of justification.[citation needed] 
It can be seen that a branch of law contains various doctrines, which in turn contain various rules or tests. The test of non-occurrence of crucial event is part of the doctrine of frustration which is part of contract law. Doctrines can grow into a branch of law; restitution is now considered a branch of law separate to contract and tort.[citation needed] 
According to sociologist Mervin Verbit, doctrine may be understood as one of the key components of religiosity. He divides doctrine into four categories: content, frequency (degree to which it may occupy the person's mind), intensity and centrality. Each of these may vary from one religion to the next, within that religious tradition.[6][7][8] 
Reverence (/ˈrɛvərəns/) is "a feeling or attitude of deep respect tinged with awe; veneration".[1] The word "reverence" in the modern day is often used in relationship with religion. This is because religion often stimulates the emotion through recognition of a god, the supernatural, and the ineffable. Reverence involves a humbling of the self in respectful recognition of something perceived to be greater than the self. 
Thus religion is commonly a place where reverence is felt. 
However, similar to awe, reverence is an emotion in its own right, and can be felt outside of the realm of religion.[2] Whereas awe may be characterized as an overwhelming "sensitivity to greatness," reverence is seen more as "acknowledging a subjective response to something excellent in a personal (moral or spiritual) way, but qualitatively above oneself" [3] Solomon describes awe as passive, but reverence as active, noting that the feeling of awe (i.e., becoming awestruck) implies paralysis, whereas feelings of reverence are associated more with active engagement and responsibility toward that which one reveres.[4] Nature, science, literature, philosophy, great philosophers, leaders, artists, art, music, wisdom, and beauty may each act as the stimulus and focus of reverence. 
Albert Schweitzer, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and holder of four PhD degrees, sought for years for the basis of a new worldview. One day, while in a boat on the river in Gabon, it struck him with great force and clarity: "Reverence for life" (In German: Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben). 
Keltner and Haidt's extensive study on awe focuses on the importance of vastness and accommodation in experiencing awe. 
"Vastness refers to anything that is experienced as being much larger that the self".[8] Accommodation refers to the "Process of adjusting mental structures that cannot assimilate a new experience".[8] Their research on awe, which is a part of reverence, and how it is experienced through moral, spiritual, and aesthetic means, sheds light on the greater understanding of reverence. Their study also consists of a comprehensive summary on what has been "Written about awe in religion, philosophy, sociology, and psychology" and their own addition of "Related states such as admiration, elevation, and the epiphanic experience".[8] 
Haidt (2000) [9] notes that since Maslow (1964) [2] studied the changes that actualizing experiences can bring about in people's identities and in their moral and spiritual lives, little empirical research has been done to examine the peak experiences and moral transformations associated with positive moral emotions such as gratitude, elevation, awe, admiration, and reverence. Haidt's own work in these areas suggests that potent feelings of reverence may be associated with the peak experiences accompanying moral transformations, where, "Powerful moments of elevation sometimes seem to push a mental ‘reset button,’ wiping out feelings of cynicism and replacing them with feelings of hope, love, and optimism, and a sense of moral inspiration."[10] 
Great artists in the creation of their art sometimes give concrete form to the culturally derived beliefs, values, and group identities that provide meaning and purpose to existence. Moreover, reverence for artwork that instantiates these central aspects of culture can provide a means of buffering the existential anxiety that follows from reminders of the inevitability of human mortality.[11] Across history, cultures have revered art as a "forum for representing in an enduring medium those individuals who are held up as embodiments of virtue and lasting significance."[12] 
Thomas and Schlutsmeyer in, "A Place for the Aesthetic in Experiential Personal Construct Psychology," look at reverence through the lens of experiential personal construct psychology (EPCP). 
Leitner & Pfenninger, in 1994, theorized this form of psychology in "Sociality and optimal functioning." 
Under this umbrella of psychology, "Reverence felt in meaningful interpersonal connectedness is one starting point for the development of a larger sense of connection with the world and the many others (human and nonhuman) in it".[13] This is referred to as transpersonal reverence. 
Thomas and Schlutsmeyer make the case for reverence in therapy: "In EPCP, reverence, as we stated earlier, is a goal of therapy, a sign of optimal functioning".[13] The therapist must revere the patient and the patient must learn to revere others and themselves in order for the therapy to be effective. 
David Pugmire's article, "The Secular Reception of Religious Music" explores the unique experience of reverence through music. In particular he looks at how religious music has the capacity to instill emotions of reverence, awe, wonder, and veneration in secular people who lack the context to fully understand the transcendent through religion. "Sacred music seems to have a surprising power over unbelievers not just to quicken or delight them as other music does, but also to ply them, as little else can, with what might be called devotional feelings".[5] Even with this though, Pugmire argues that the secularist cannot fully comprehend the nature of sacred art including sacred music. 
"Its undoubted expressiveness can lead him at most to accesses of feeling, not to emotion in the fullest sense, i.e., emotion with appropriate objects sustained by appropriate judgments".[5]

For the album's artwork, he got his fans on Twitter to email him their portraits showing their bad hair periods, he then combined all the portraits in an artistic manner assembling his face.[13] Bad Hair reached number-one on the iTunes local charts and was the most streamed album in South Africa within its 24 hours.[14] Ngcobo released a 14-minute film featuring three songs from Bad Hair directed by Kyle Lewis. 
The short-film which included tracks "Don't Do It'", "Good Girls and Snapchat Hoes" and "Phases" featuring Rowlene, was commercially featured in several countries including France, Germany, United Kingdom and United States, which was infrequent for an African video.[15] 
On 2 December 2016, Ngcobo released the extended version for Bad Hair named Bad Hair Extensions.[16] Bad Hair Extension featured new four songs including the lead single Allow featuring American rapper French Montana. 
In winning many accolades for both 2016 and 2017, Ngcobo received his biggest nomination which was for the 2017 BET Award for Best International Act: Africa where he lost to Wizkid.[17] He was also nominated for the 2017 MTV Europe Music Awards.[18] Ngcobo was ranked third on the 2016 MTV Base: SA's Hottest MCs.[19] In 2017 he was ranked again on the same event, this time at the fourth place.[20] 
2018: UMG deals and Strings and Bling 
On 16 February, Ngcobo signed a distribution deal with Universal Music Africa[21] in partnership with Universal Music South Africa and a talent booking deal with UMG Live Africa.[22] On 1 June, during his visit to Nigeria, he signed a distribution deal with Universal Music Group Nigeria,[23] before the pre-release of his singles, "Jungle" and "King" featuring American rapper A$AP Ferg, from his second album, Strings and Bling.[24] In June 2018, during a press release with Premium Times,[23] the general manager of Universal Music Group Nigeria, Ezegozie Eze said "Strings and Bling is a testament to skill, craft and passion that he brings to his game every single time, and we are thrilled to bring this excellent body of work to the market". Strings and Bling was then released on 6 July 2018 in both digital and physical formats.[25][26] TimesLIVE named Strings and Bling one of the best hip hop albums in South Africa, and it was also included in the list of hip hop albums on Tina magazine.[27][28] The album's other singles include "SMA" featuring Rowlene, and the promotional single "Gravy". 
On 20 August 2018, Ngcobo established his own record label, Tall Racks Records.[29] His long-term associated singer Rowlene was the first act to sign under the label, alongside himself. 
Ngcobo began the Ivyson Tour on 6 October 2018, at the Melrose Arch in Johannesburg. 
The tour with five consecutive shows (four in South Africa and one in Namibia) was a success with filled up attendance.[30] At the end of 2018 he was ranked in MTV Base: SA's Hottest MCs for the third time in a row, at the third place.[31] 
As for 2019, Ngcobo was named the ambassador of the male grooming company, Axe South Africa.[32] At the 2019 Dstv Mzansi Viewers Choice Awards his single "SMA (Vol.

1997–2015: Early life and initial mixtapes 
Nsikayesizwe David Junior Ngcobo was born on 11 February 1997 in Diepkloof, a borough of Soweto, Johannesburg. 
After the passing of his mother who was involved in a fatal car crash while he was 11 months, he relocated to Durban, Kwa-Zulu Natal to be raised by his father, David Maviyo Ngcobo, who is a human resources manager.[7] He has an older brother, Siyabonga Ngcobo, who influenced him to rap as he learnt the basics of producing music from him at the age of nine. 
Ngcobo attended Strelitzia Secondary School in Lotus Park, Durban where he completed his 12th grade.[8] 
At the age of fourteen, Ngcobo released his debut mixtape One Kid, a Thousand Coffins on 14 May 2012.[9] He then released his debut EP L.A.M.E (Levitating Above My Enemies) on 4 April 2014.[10] The following year on 10 February, he released his second mixtape Price City which produced the successful single "Juice Back" that raised his prominence.[11] "Juice Back" later spawned a Gemini Major-produced remix featuring singer Davido and rapper Cassper Nyovest on 20 November 2015. 
"XXX" is often used to designate pornographic material. 
Pornography (often shortened to porn or porno) is the portrayal of sexual subject matter for the exclusive purpose of sexual arousal.[1] A distinction could be drawn between uncensored explicit or hardcore erotic art, and pornography.[2] Pornography may be presented in a variety of media, including magazines, animation, writing, film, video, and video games. 
The term does not include live exhibitions like sex shows and striptease. The primary subjects of present-day pornographic depictions are pornographic models, who pose for still photographs, and pornographic actors who engage in filmed sex acts. 
Various groups within society have considered depictions of a sexual nature immoral, addictive, and noxious, labeling them pornographic, and attempting to have them suppressed under obscenity laws, censored or made illegal. Such grounds, and even the definition of pornography, have differed in various historical, cultural, and national contexts.[1] In the late 19th century, various films by Thomas Edison were denounced as obscene in the United States, whereas Eugene Pirou's Le Coucher de la Mariée became very popular in France.[2][3] Social attitudes towards the discussion and presentation of sexuality have become more tolerant in Western countries, and legal definitions of obscenity have become more limited, beginning in 1969 with Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, the first adult erotic film depicting explicit sexual intercourse to receive wide theatrical release in the United States. 
It was followed by the Golden Age of Porn (1969–1984), in which the best quality pornographic films became part of mainstream culture.[4][5][6]

A growing industry for the production and consumption of pornography developed in the latter half of the 20th century. 
The introduction of home video and the Internet saw a boom in the worldwide porn industry that generates billions of dollars annually.[1] Commercialized pornography accounts for over US$2.5 billion in the United States alone,[2] including the production of various media and associated products and services. 
The porn industry is between $10–$12 billion in the U.S.[3] In 2006, the world pornography revenue was 97 billion dollars.[4] This industry employs thousands of performers along with support and production staff. 
It is also followed by dedicated industry publications and trade groups, award shows such as the AVN Awards, as well as the mainstream press, private organizations (watchdog groups), government agencies, and political organizations.[5] Videos involving non-consensual content and cybersex trafficking have been hosted on popular pornography sites in the 21st century.[6][7][8][9] 
In June 2020, Tshegofatso Pule was found stabbed and hanging from a tree in Durban Deep, Roodepoort. 
Pule, a 28 year-old South African woman, was 8 months pregnant at the time.[1] 
After an investigation, police established that her boyfriend, Nothuthuko Shoba was responsible for her murder by hiring a hitman to kill her. 
[2][3]Shoba was convicted of conspiracy to murder and related charges in March 2022. 
A few months prior, in January, the hitman Muzikayise Malephane testified on his and Shoba's plan to murder Pule.[4] Malephane had pled guilty to the murder in February 2021.[5]

Nsikayesizwe David Junior Ngcobo was born on 11 February 1997 in Diepkloof, a borough of Soweto, Johannesburg. 
After the passing of his mother who was involved in a fatal car crash while he was 11 months, he relocated to Durban, Kwa-Zulu Natal to be raised by his father, David Maviyo Ngcobo, who is a human resources manager.[7] He has an older brother, Siyabonga Ngcobo, who influenced him to rap as he learnt the basics of producing music from him at the age of nine. 
Ngcobo attended Strelitzia Secondary School in Lotus Park, Durban where he completed his 12th grade.[8] 
At the age of fourteen, Ngcobo released his debut mixtape One Kid, a Thousand Coffins on 14 May 2012.[9] He then released his debut EP L.A.M.E (Levitating Above My Enemies) on 4 April 2014.[10] The following year on 10 February, he released his second mixtape Price City which produced the successful single "Juice Back" that raised his prominence.[11] "Juice Back" later spawned a Gemini Major-produced remix featuring singer Davido and rapper Cassper Nyovest on 20 November 2015. 
Kwela is a pennywhistle-based street music from southern Africa[1] with jazzy underpinnings and a distinctive, skiffle-like beat. 
It evolved from the marabi sound and brought South African music to international prominence in the 1950s. 
The music has its roots in southern Africa but later adaptations of this and many other African folk idioms have permeated Western music (listen to the albums A Swingin' Safari by the Bert Kaempfert Orchestra (1962) and Graceland by Paul Simon (1986)), giving modern South African music, particularly jazz, much of its distinctive sound and lilting swagger. 
The Piranha's 1982 UK Top Ten hit 'Tom Hark' was based on an earlier 1950's Kwela hit song.

ISBN 1-85928-143-5. 
One reason for the use of the pennywhistle is that it is cheap and portable, but it also lends itself as a solo or an ensemble instrument. 
The popularity of the pennywhistle may have been based on the fact that flutes of different kinds have long been traditional instruments among the peoples of the more northerly parts of South Africa and the pennywhistle thus enabled the swift adaptation of folk tunes into the new marabi-influenced music. 
The most common explanation for the word "khwela" is that it is taken from the Zulu for "Climb", though in township slang it also referred to the police vans, the "khwela-khwela". 
Thus, it could be an invitation to join the dance, as well as serving as a warning. 
It is said that the young men who played the pennywhistle on street corners also acted as lookouts to warn those enjoying themselves in the shebeens of the arrival of the police.[2] White people, unaware of its meaning, then thought that it referred to the music when they heard people shouting "Here comes the kwela, kwela!" warning of the police's presence.[3] 
Although it has been asserted that Khwela music exclusively uses the chord progression I-IV-I 4 6 {\displaystyle {}_{4}^{6}} -V.,[5] others maintain that there is no specific Khwela chord progression, and that I-IV-V-I and I-I-IV-V are particularly prevalent.[6] 
Artists such as Lemmy Mabaso were renowned for their pennywhistle skills, and Spokes Mashiyane was one of the most prominent with his kwela pennywhistle tunes.[1] Other artists include The Skylarks, Jack Lerole, Aaron Lerole, The Solven Whistlers, Kippie Moeketsi, Donald Kachamba and Gwigwi Mrwebe. 
Amapiano (isiXhosa for "the pianos"[1]) is a style of house music that emerged in South Africa[2] in 2012. 
It is a hybrid of deep house, jazz and lounge music characterized by synths, airy pads and wide percussive basslines.[3] It is distinguished by high-pitched piano melodies, Kwaito basslines, low tempo 90s South African house rhythms and percussions from another local subgenre of house known as Bacardi.[4]

Although the genre gained popularity in Katlehong, the township east of Johannesburg, there is a lot of ambiguity and debate concerning its origins, with various accounts of the musical styles in the Johannesburg townships - Soweto, Alexandra, Vosloorus and Katlehong. 
Because of the genre's similarities with Bacardi, some people assert the genre began in Pretoria.[5][6][7] Various accounts as to who formed the popular genre make it impossible to accurately pinpoint its origins.[8] 
An important element of the genre is the use of the "log drum", a creation which has been attributed to Mdu aka TRP. 
Amapiano pioneer Kabza De Small stated: 
I don’t know what happened. 
I don't know how he figured out the log drum. 
Amapiano music has always been there, but he’s the one who came up with the log drum sound. 
These boys like experimenting. 
They always check out new plug-ins. 
SO when Mdu figured it out, he ran with it.[9]

Sipho’s music career began when he formed a group called The Beaters with two of his friends Selby Ntuli and “Om” Alec Khaoli, when he was just 15 years old. 
After touring Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) in 1974, and dedicating a song “Harari”to the people of that town, the group later changed its stage name to Harari –and went on to gain acclaim as one of the most successful acts that dominated the local music scene in the 70s with its “feel good vibes of Afro-rock spiced with some get down boogie woogie space jabs”, “vibrating in percussion in toto, conga drumming and some breath taking wailing of flutes and pennywhisltes”. . 
In 1978, Harari was invited to perform in the USA with fellow musician Hugh Masekela, but the band’s leader Selby Ntuli died leaving Sipho as the new leader. 
Under the new front man, the group went on to support and back renowned musicians such as Percy Sledge, Timmy Thomas, Letta Mbula, Brook Benton, and Wilson Pickett on their South African tours. 
In 1982, the group split giving Sipho a chance to launch his solo career making him one of the pioneers of township pop while riding the wave of disco music. 
On 2 November 2021 Sipho celebrates his 70th birthday. 
He continues to perform regularly. 
Sipho "Hotstix" Mabuse (born in Johannesburg, 2 November 1951) is a South African singer. 
Sipho grew up in Soweto. 
His mother was Zulu and his father was Tswana. 
Sipho and his band used to be managed by Solly Nkuta, After dropping out of school in the 1960s,[1] Mabuse got his start in the Afro-soul group the Beaters in the mid-1970s. After a successful tour of Zimbabwe they changed the group's name to Harari, an afrosoul band led by Mabuse. 
When they returned to their homeland in South Africa they began to draw almost exclusively on American-style funk, soul, and pop music, sung in Zulu and Sotho as well as English. 
He has also recorded and produced for, amongst others, Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masekela, Ray Phiri and Sibongile Khumalo. 
Mabuse returned to school at the age of 60, completing his matric (grade 12) in 2012 at Peter Lengene Community Learning Centre.[2] He stated that he intended to continue on to college and study anthropology. 
President Jacob Zuma praised him for giving "inspiration to all of us by showing us that one is never too old for education".[2] 
Artist's conception of gravity pulling matter away from a star and into a black hole 
Ancient world 
The nature and mechanism of gravity was explored by a wide range of ancient scholars. 
In Greece, Aristotle believed that objects fell towards the Earth because the Earth was the center of the Universe and attracted all of the mass in the Universe towards it. 
He also thought that the speed of a falling object should increase with its weight, a conclusion which was later shown to be false.[1] While Aristotle's view was widely accepted throughout Ancient Greece, there were other thinkers such as Plutarch who correctly predicted that the attraction of gravity was not unique to the Earth.[2] 
Although he didn't understand gravity as a force, the ancient Greek philosopher Archimedes discovered the center of gravity of a triangle.[1] He also postulated that if two equal weights did not have the same center of gravity, the center of gravity of the two weights together would be in the middle of the line that joins their centers of gravity.[2] 
In India, the mathematician-astronomer Aryabhata first identified gravity to explain why objects are not driven away from the Earth by the centrifugal force of the planet's rotation. Later, in the seventh century CE, Brahmagupta proposed the idea that gravity is an attractive force which draws objects to the Earth and used the term gurutvākarṣaṇ to describe it.[1][2][3] 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals and humans. AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.[lower-alpha 1] 
The term "artificial intelligence" had previously been used to describe machines that mimic and display "human" cognitive skills that are associated with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem-solving". 
This definition has since been rejected by major AI researchers who now describe AI in terms of rationality and acting rationally, which does not limit how intelligence can be articulated.[lower-alpha 2] 
AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).[2] As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[3] For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI,[4] having become a routine technology.[5] 
Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism,[6][1] followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"),[2][3] followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.[1][10] AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical-statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.[10][4]

Artificial beings with intelligence appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity,[1] and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R.[17] These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.[18] 
The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. 
The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. 
This insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the Church–Turing thesis.[19] This, along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.[1] The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete "artificial neurons".[21] 
The word "robot" itself was coined by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play R.U.R., the title standing for "Rossum's Universal Robots". 
Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,[1] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.[18] 
A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. 
This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). 
In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.[234] 
Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many books and stories, most notably the "Multivac" series about a super-intelligent computer of the same name. 
Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;[235] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.[236] 
Transhumanism (the merging of humans and machines) is explored in the manga Ghost in the Shell and the science-fiction series Dune. 
Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. 
This appears in Karel Čapek's R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick. 
Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.[237]

Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence. Commonalities between dragons' traits are often a hybridization of feline, avian, and reptilian features. Scholars believe huge extinct or migrating crocodiles bear the closest resemblance, especially when encountered in forested or swampy areas, and are most likely the template of modern Oriental dragon imagery.[1][2]

The Milky Way[lower-alpha 2] is the galaxy that includes our Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the Greek γαλακτικός κύκλος (galaktikos kýklos), meaning "milky circle".[1][2][3] From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. 
Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe.[4] Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis,[5] observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.

Articulated welding robots used in a factory are a type of industrial robot 
The word robot can refer to both physical robots and virtual software agents, but the latter are usually referred to as bots.[1] There is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots but there is general agreement among experts, and the public, that robots tend to possess some or all of the following abilities and functions: accept electronic programming, process data or physical perceptions electronically, operate autonomously to some degree, move around, operate physical parts of itself or physical processes, sense and manipulate their environment, and exhibit intelligent behavior, especially behavior which mimics humans or other animals.[2][3] Related to the concept of a robot is the field of synthetic biology, which studies entities whose nature is more comparable to living things than to machines.

Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces such as wind and water, and by chemical, thermal, or electrical power, and include a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement. They can also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, often called mechanical systems. 
Renaissance natural philosophers identified six simple machines which were the elementary devices that put a load into motion, and calculated the ratio of output force to input force, known today as mechanical advantage.[1]

He has also extensively worked with record producers DJ Maphorisa and Kabza De Small. 
He attended Benoni West Primary and Lee Rand High School in Benoni. 
He completed his matric at Unity Secondary School in Daveyton.[1] 
Young Stunna was born in Daveyton, South Africa and grew up in a Christian family and often sang in the church choir. 
His mother was a vocalist and his father owned a tavern which had a jukebox. 
Spending time at the tavern on weekends exposed him to all types of genres, including RnB and Kwaito.[1] 
Towards the end of April 2022, Stunna was featured by Spotify on Spotify documentary Freedom Sounds: From Kwaito to Amapiano.[1] 
He started making music at the age 13 and took the decision to pursue music as a career. 
He was initially a hip-hop musician from 2012 before switching to amapiano. 
He got the name Young Stunna from his fans in Daveyton where he grew up.[1] He rose to fame earlier in 2021 as part of the piano hub roster-when he featured on Felo Le Tee and Mellow & Sleazy's smash amapiano hit, “Bopha”.[2]

Infrastructure is the set of facilities and systems that serve a country, city, or other area,[1] and encompasses the services and facilities necessary for its economy, households and firms to function.[2] Infrastructure is composed of public and private physical structures such as roads, railways, bridges, tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids, and telecommunications (including Internet connectivity and broadband access). In general, infrastructure has been defined as "the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal living conditions" and maintain the surrounding environment.[3]

A simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time.[1] Simulations require the use of models; the model represents the key characteristics or behaviors of the selected system or process, whereas the simulation represents the evolution of the model over time. 
Often, computers are used to execute the simulation.

The Zulu Wikipedia is the Zulu-language edition of Wikipedia, a free, open-content encyclopedia. 
Started in November 2003, it rose to 186 articles as of May 13, 2009, and to 766 on April 25, 2016, making it the 247th largest Wikipedia language edition (down from 221st in the previous date).[1] 
It has 10,594 articles as of October 2022 and 34 active registered users. 
Although it was the third African-language Wikipedia to reach 100 articles,[2] progress has been slow, and it has been surpassed by numerous other African languages. 
As Zulu is mostly mutually intelligible with Xhosa, both of which are Nguni languages, it is possible for articles in the Zulu edition to be easily translated into Xhosa for the Xhosa Wikipedia. 
Similar trans-wiki efforts have been made for Scandinavian-language editions, such as the Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish through Wikimedia's Skanwiki collaboration tool. 
In January 2012, the Zulu Wikipedia was proposed for closing. 
The proposal was rejected in March 2012.[3]

The term "computer", in use from the early 17th century (the first known written reference dates from 1613),[1] meant "one who computes": a person performing mathematical calculations, before electronic computers became commercially available. 
Alan Turing described the "human computer" as someone who is "supposed to be following fixed rules; he has no authority to deviate from them in any detail."[2] Teams of people, often women from the late nineteenth century onwards, were used to undertake long and often tedious calculations; the work was divided so that this could be done in parallel. 
The same calculations were frequently performed independently by separate teams to check the correctness of the results. 
Even very young children perform rudimentary experiments to learn about the world and how things work. 
An experiment is a procedure carried out to support or refute a hypothesis, or determine the efficacy or likelihood of something previously untried. 
Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated. 
Experiments vary greatly in goal and scale but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results. 
There also exist natural experimental studies. 
A child may carry out basic experiments to understand how things fall to the ground, while teams of scientists may take years of systematic investigation to advance their understanding of a phenomenon. 
Experiments and other types of hands-on activities are very important to student learning in the science classroom. 
Experiments can raise test scores and help a student become more engaged and interested in the material they are learning, especially when used over time.[1] Experiments can vary from personal and informal natural comparisons (e.g. tasting a range of chocolates to find a favorite), to highly controlled (e.g. tests requiring complex apparatus overseen by many scientists that hope to discover information about subatomic particles). 
Uses of experiments vary considerably between the natural and human sciences. 
Experiments typically include controls, which are designed to minimize the effects of variables other than the single independent variable. 
This increases the reliability of the results, often through a comparison between control measurements and the other measurements. 
Scientific controls are a part of the scientific method. 
Ideally, all variables in an experiment are controlled (accounted for by the control measurements) and none are uncontrolled. 
In such an experiment, if all controls work as expected, it is possible to conclude that the experiment works as intended, and that results are due to the effect of the tested variables.

The hypothesis of Andreas Cellarius, showing the planetary motions in eccentric and epicyclical orbits. 
A hypothesis (plural hypotheses) is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. 
For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. 
Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. 
Even though the words "hypothesis" and "theory" are often used interchangeably, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a scientific theory. 
A working hypothesis is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further research[1] in a process beginning with an educated guess or thought.[2]

Innovation is the practical implementation of ideas that result in the introduction of new goods or services or improvement in offering goods or services.[1] ISO TC 279 in the standard ISO 56000:2020 [2] defines innovation as "a new or changed entity realizing or redistributing value". 
Others have different definitions; a common element in the definitions is a focus on newness, improvement, and spread of ideas or technologies.

These are some of the different types of data. 
In the pursuit of knowledge, data (US: /ˈdætə/; UK: /ˈdeɪtə/) is a collection of discrete values that convey information, describing quantity, quality, fact, statistics, other basic units of meaning, or simply sequences of symbols that may be further interpreted. 
A datum is an individual state in a set of data. 
Data usually is organized into structures such as tables that provide additional context and meaning, and which may themselves be used as data in larger structures. 
Data may be used as variables in a computational process.[1][2] Data may represent abstract ideas or concrete measurements.[3] Data is commonly used in scientific research, finance, and in virtually every other form of human organizational activity. 
Examples of data sets include stock prices, crime rates, unemployment rates, literacy rates, and census data. 
Data represents the raw facts and figures which can be used in such a manner in order to capture the useful information out of it.

Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that studies the fundamental nature of reality, the first principles of being, identity and change, space and time, causality, necessity, and possibility.[1] It includes questions about the nature of consciousness and the relationship between mind and matter, between substance and attribute, and between potentiality and actuality.[2] The word "metaphysics" comes from two Greek words that, together, literally mean "after or behind or among [the study of] the natural". 
It has been suggested that the term might have been coined by a first century CE editor who assembled various small selections of Aristotle's works into the treatise we now know by the name Metaphysics (μετὰ τὰ φυσικά, meta ta physika, lit. 'after the Physics ', another of Aristotle's works).[3] 
Metaphysics studies questions related to what it is for something to exist and what types of existence there are. 
Metaphysics seeks to answer, in an abstract and fully general manner, the questions of:[4] 
What there is What it is like 
Topics of metaphysical investigation include existence, objects and their properties, space and time, cause and effect, and possibility. Metaphysics is considered one of the four main branches of philosophy, along with epistemology, logic, and ethics.[5]

An encyclopedia (American English), or encyclopaedia (British English) is a reference work or compendium providing summaries of knowledge either general or special to a particular field or discipline.[1] Encyclopedias are divided into articles or entries that are arranged alphabetically by article name[2] or by thematic categories, or else are hyperlinked and searchable by random access. 
Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed than those in most dictionaries.[2] Generally speaking, encyclopedia articles focus on factual information concerning the subject named in the article's title; this is unlike dictionary entries, which focus on linguistic information about words, such as their etymology, meaning, pronunciation, use, and grammatical forms.[3][4][5][6]

Unlike the female worker bee, drones do not have stingers. They gather neither nectar nor pollen and are unable to feed without assistance from worker bees. A drone's only role is to mate with a maiden queen in nuptial flight. 
The Cessna 172 Skyhawk is the most produced aircraft in history. 
The Mil Mi-8 is the most-produced helicopter in history.[1] 
An aircraft is a vehicle or machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil,[1] or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. Common examples of aircraft include airplanes, helicopters, airships (including blimps), gliders, paramotors, and hot air balloons.[2] 
It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas and the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table.[lower-alpha 1] Its boiling and melting point are the lowest among all the elements. It is the second lightest and second most abundant element in the observable universe (hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant). It is present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. 
Drone warfare is a form of Aerial warfare using unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAV) or weaponized commercial unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The United States, United Kingdom, Israel, China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, India, Pakistan, Russia, Turkey, and Poland[1][2] are known to have manufactured operational UCAVs as of 2019.[3] As of 2022, the Ukrainian enterprise Ukroboronprom and NGO group Aerorozvidka have built strike-capable drones and used them in combat.[4] 
Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all normal matter.[2][note 1] Stars such as the Sun are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. Most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water and organic compounds. For the most common isotope of hydrogen (symbol 1H) each atom has one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.

A creator deity or creator god (often called the Creator) is a deity responsible for the creation of the Earth, world, and universe in human religion and mythology. In monotheism, the single God is often also the creator. A number of monolatristic traditions separate a secondary creator from a primary transcendent being, identified as a primary creator.[1] 
A virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism.[1] Viruses infect all life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.[2][3] Since Dmitri Ivanovsky's 1892 article describing a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants and the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898,[4] more than 9,000 virus species have been described in detail[5] of the millions of types of viruses in the environment.[6] Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity.[7][8] The study of viruses is known as virology, a subspeciality of microbiology.

While Misuzulu is the third oldest surviving son of King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, he is the first son of King Goodwill Zwelithini's Great Wife, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini. 
Misuzulu became heir presumptive after the death of his father on 12 March 2021,[2][3] however although being officially appointed as the king of the Zulu nation, his traditional coronation did not take place until 20 August 2022 after the customary entering the cattle kraal ceremony, ukungena esibayeni. 
The King was officially coronated and recognized by the government on 29 October 2022.[4][5][6] 
The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) with sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.[1][2][3][4][5] Internet of things has been considered a misnomer because devices do not need to be connected to the public internet, they only need to be connected to a network and be individually addressable.[6][7]

Generally, a day is roughly the time of one rotation of the Earth (about 24 hours) or one rotation of other large astronomical objects.[1] In everyday life, the word "day" often refers to a solar day, which is the length between two solar noons or times the Sun reaches the highest point. 
The word "day" may also refer to daytime, a time period when the location receives direct and indirect sunlight. On Earth, as a location passes through its day, it experiences morning, noon, afternoon, evening, and night. The effect of a day is vital to many life processes, which is called the circadian rhythm.

The term can also refer just to the message communicated or to the field of inquiry studying such transmissions. There are many disagreements about its precise definition.[4][5] John Peters argues that the difficulty of defining communication emerges from the fact that communication is both a universal phenomenon (because everyone communicates) and a specific discipline of institutional academic study.[6] One definitional strategy involves limiting what can be included in the category of communication (for example, requiring a "conscious intent" to persuade[7]). By this logic, one possible definition of communication is the act of developing meaning among entities or groups through the use of sufficiently mutually understood signs, symbols, and semiotic conventions. 
A raised, closed fist 
A fist is the shape of a hand when the fingers are bent inward against the palm and held there tightly. To make or clench a fist is to fold the fingers tightly into the center of the palm and then to clamp the thumb over the middle phalanges; in contrast to this "closed" fist, one keeps the fist "open" by holding the thumb against the side of the index finger. One uses the closed fist to punch the lower phalanges against a surface, or to pound with the little-finger side of the hand's heel; one uses the open fist to knock with the middle knuckle of the middle finger. 
A photon (from Ancient Greek φῶς, φωτός (phôs, phōtós) 'light') is an elementary particle that is a quantum of the electromagnetic field, including electromagnetic radiation such as light and radio waves, and the force carrier for the electromagnetic force. Photons are massless,[lower-alpha 1] so they always move at the speed of light in vacuum, 299792458 m/s (or about 186,282 mi/s). The photon belongs to the class of bosons.

Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for abstraction, logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information, and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context. 
A definition states the meaning of a word using other words. This is sometimes challenging. Common dictionaries contain lexical descriptive definitions, but there are various types of definition – all with different purposes and focuses.

A proton is a stable subatomic particle, symbol p , H+, or 1H+ with a positive electric charge of +1 e elementary charge. Its mass is slightly less than that of a neutron and 1836 times the mass of an electron (the proton–electron mass ratio). Protons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are jointly referred to as "nucleons" (particles present in atomic nuclei). 
A composite particle proton is made of two up quark and one down quark, which are elementary particles 
In particle physics, an elementary particle or fundamental particle is a subatomic particle that is not composed of other particles.[1] Particles currently thought to be elementary include electrons, the fundamental fermions (quarks, leptons, antiquarks, and antileptons, which generally are matter particles and antimatter particles), as well as the fundamental bosons (gauge bosons and the Higgs boson), which generally are force particles that mediate interactions among fermions.[1] A particle containing two or more elementary particles is a composite particle. 
It is a soft, malleable, and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity. A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color. Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a building material, and as a constituent of various metal alloys, such as sterling silver used in jewelry, cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins, and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement.

Capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit.[1][2][3][4] Central characteristics of capitalism include capital accumulation, competitive markets, price system, private property, property rights recognition, voluntary exchange, and wage labor.[5][6] In a market economy, decision-making and investments are determined by owners of wealth, property, or ability to maneuver capital or production ability in capital and financial markets—whereas prices and the distribution of goods and services are mainly determined by competition in goods and services markets.[7] 
Socialism is a left-wing[1] economic philosophy and movement encompassing a range of economic systems characterized by the dominance of social ownership[2] of the means of production[3][4] as opposed to private ownership.[5][6][4] As a term, it describes the economic, political and social theories and movements associated with the implementation of such systems.[5] Social ownership can be state/public, community, collective, cooperative, or employee.[6][7] While no single definition encapsulates the many types of socialism,[10] social ownership is the one common element.[11][6][4] Different types of socialism vary based on the role of markets and planning in resource allocation, on the structure of management in organizations, and from below or from above approaches, with some socialists favouring a party, state, or technocratic-driven approach. 
Socialists disagree on whether government, particularly existing government, is the correct vehicle for change.[8][9]

A privately held company or private company is a company which does not offer or trade its company stock (shares) to the general public on the stock market exchanges, but rather the company's stock is offered, owned, traded, exchanged privately, or over-the-counter. In the case of a closed corporation, there are a relatively small number of shareholders or company members. Related terms are closely held corporation, unquoted company, and unlisted company. 
In biology, a pathogen (Greek: πάθος, pathos "suffering", "passion" and -γενής, -genēs "producer of") in the oldest and broadest sense, is any organism or agent that can produce disease. A pathogen may also be referred to as an infectious agent, or simply a germ.[1]

Orion is a prominent constellation located on the celestial equator and visible throughout the world. It is one of the most conspicuous[1] and recognizable constellations in the night sky.[2] It is named after Orion, a hunter in Greek mythology. Its brightest stars are blue-white Rigel (Beta Orionis) and red Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis). 
It has the Bayer designation β Orionis, which is Latinized to Beta Orionis and abbreviated Beta Ori or β Ori. Rigel is the brightest and most massive component – and the eponym – of a star system of at least four stars that appear as a single blue-white point of light to the naked eye. This system is located at a distance of approximately 860 light-years (260 pc) from the Sun.

Preterism, a Christian eschatological view, interprets some (partial preterism) or all (full preterism) prophecies of the Bible as events which have already happened. This school of thought interprets the Book of Daniel as referring to events that happened from the 7th century BC until the first century AD, while seeing the prophecies of the Book of Revelation as events that happened in the first century AD. Preterism holds that Ancient Israel finds its continuation or fulfillment in the Christian church at the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70.

An interpretation is an assignment of meaning to the symbols of a formal language. Many formal languages used in mathematics, logic, and theoretical computer science are defined in solely syntactic terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called formal semantics.

Petroleum, also known as crude oil, or simply oil, is a naturally occurring yellowish-black liquid mixture of mainly hydrocarbons,[1] and is found in geological formations. The name petroleum covers both naturally occurring unprocessed crude oil and petroleum products that consist of refined crude oil. A fossil fuel, petroleum is formed when large quantities of dead organisms, mostly zooplankton and algae, are buried underneath sedimentary rock and subjected to both prolonged heat and pressure.

Bamboos are a diverse group of evergreen perennial flowering plants making up the subfamily Bambusoideae of the grass family Poaceae. Giant bamboos are the largest members of the grass family. The origin of the word "bamboo" is uncertain, but it probably comes from the Dutch or Portuguese language, which originally borrowed it from Malay or Kannada.[1] 
An article or piece is a written work published in a print or electronic medium. It may be for the purpose of propagating news, research results, academic analysis, or debate. 
It is taught as an academic discipline, typically in universities and seminaries.[1] It occupies itself with the unique content of analyzing the supernatural, but also deals with religious epistemology, asks and seeks to answer the question of revelation. Revelation pertains to the acceptance of God, gods, or deities, as not only transcendent or above the natural world, but also willing and able to interact with the natural world and, in particular, to reveal themselves to humankind. While theology has turned into a secular field [according to whom?], religious adherents still consider theology to be a discipline that helps them live and understand concepts such as life and love and that helps them lead lives of obedience to the deities they follow or worship. 
Politics (from Greek: Πολιτικά, politiká, 'affairs of the cities') is the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups, or other forms of power relations among individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status.

Aristotle (/ˈærɪstɒtəl/;[4] Greek: Ἀριστοτέλης Aristotélēs, pronounced [aristotélɛːs]; 384–322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and polymath during the Classical period in Ancient Greece. Taught by Plato, he was the founder of the Peripatetic school of philosophy within the Lyceum and the wider Aristotelian tradition. His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics, meteorology, geology, and government. 
Description is the pattern of narrative development that aims to make vivid a place, object, character, or group.[1] Description is one of four rhetorical modes (also known as modes of discourse), along with exposition, argumentation, and narration.[2] In practice it would be difficult to write literature that drew on just one of the four basic modes.[3]

The Fourth Industrial Revolution, 4IR, or Industry 4.0,[1] conceptualizes rapid change to technology, industries, and societal patterns and processes in the 21st century due to increasing interconnectivity and smart automation. The term has been used widely in scientific literature,[2] [failed verification] and in 2015 was popularized by Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum Founder and Executive chairman. Schwab asserts that the changes seen are more than just improvements to efficiency, but express a significant shift in industrial capitalism.[3]

Epistemology (/ɪˌpɪstəˈmɒlədʒi/ (listen); from Ancient Greek ἐπιστήμη (epistḗmē) 'knowledge', and -logy), or the theory of knowledge, is the branch of philosophy concerned with knowledge. Epistemology is considered a major subfield of philosophy, along with other major subfields such as ethics, logic, and metaphysics.[1] 
President is a common title for the head of state in most republics. The president of a nation is, generally speaking, the head of the government and the fundamental leader of the country or the ceremonial head of state. 
Around 6,400 extant species of mammals have been described divided into 29 orders. The largest orders, in terms of number of species, are the rodents, bats, and Eulipotyphla (hedgehogs, moles, shrews, and others). The next three are the Primates (including humans, apes, monkeys, and others), the Artiodactyla (cetaceans and even-toed ungulates), and the Carnivora (cats, dogs, seals, and others). 
Reptiles, as most commonly defined are the animals in the class Reptilia (/rɛpˈtɪliə/ rep-TIL-ee), a grouping comprising all sauropsids except birds.[1] Living reptiles comprise turtles, crocodilians, squamates (lizards and snakes) and rhynchocephalians (tuatara). As of March 2022, the Reptile Database includes about 11,700 species.[2] In the traditional Linnaean classification system, birds are considered a separate class to reptiles. 
However, crocodilians are more closely related to birds than they are to other living reptiles, and so modern cladistic classification systems include birds within Reptilia, redefining the term as a clade. Other cladistic definitions abandon the term reptile altogether in favor of the clade Sauropsida, which refers to all amniotes more closely related to modern reptiles than to mammals. The study of the traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. 
In biological classification, class (Latin: classis) is a taxonomic rank, as well as a taxonomic unit, a taxon, in that rank. It is a group of related taxonomic orders.[lower-alpha 1] Other well-known ranks in descending order of size are life, domain, kingdom, phylum, order, family, genus, and species, with class fitting between phylum and order. 
In biology, a kingdom (Latin: regnum, plural regna) is the second highest taxonomic rank, just below domain. Kingdoms are divided into smaller groups called phyla. 
In biological taxonomy, a domain (/dəˈmeɪn/ or /doʊˈmeɪn/) (Latin: regio[1]), also dominion,[2] superkingdom, realm, or empire,[3] is the highest taxonomic rank of all organisms taken together. It was introduced in the three-domain system of taxonomy devised by Carl Woese, Otto Kandler and Mark Wheelis in 1990.[1] 
In biological classification, the order is a taxonomic rank used in the classification of organisms and recognized by the nomenclature codes. An immediately higher rank, superorder, is sometimes added directly above order, with suborder directly beneath order. An order can also be defined as a group of related families. 
Family (Latin: familia, plural familiae) is one of the eight major hierarchical taxonomic ranks in Linnaean taxonomy. It is classified between order and genus.[1] A family may be divided into subfamilies, which are intermediate ranks between the ranks of family and genus. The official family names are Latin in origin; however, popular names are often used: for example, walnut trees and hickory trees belong to the family Juglandaceae, but that family is commonly referred to as the "walnut family". 
Organisms are grouped into taxa (singular: taxon) and these groups are given a taxonomic rank; groups of a given rank can be aggregated to form a more inclusive group of higher rank, thus creating a taxonomic hierarchy. The principal ranks in modern use are domain, kingdom, phylum (division is sometimes used in botany in place of phylum), class, order, family, genus, and species. The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus is regarded as the founder of the current system of taxonomy, as he developed a ranked system known as Linnaean taxonomy for categorizing organisms and binomial nomenclature for naming organisms. 
The major ranks: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species, applied to the red fox, Vulpes vulpes. 
In biology, a phylum (/ˈfaɪləm/; plural: phyla) is a level of classification or taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division has been used instead of phylum, although the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepts the terms as equivalent.[1][2][3] Depending on definitions, the animal kingdom Animalia contains about 31 phyla, the plant kingdom Plantae contains about 14 phyla, and the fungus kingdom Fungi contains about 8 phyla. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta. 
Lymph (from Latin, lympha, meaning "water")[1] is the fluid that flows through the lymphatic system, a system composed of lymph vessels (channels) and intervening lymph nodes whose function, like the venous system, is to return fluid from the tissues to be recirculated. At the origin of the fluid-return process, interstitial fluid—the fluid between the cells in all body tissues[2]—enters the lymph capillaries. This lymphatic fluid is then transported via progressively larger lymphatic vessels through lymph nodes, where substances are removed by tissue lymphocytes and circulating lymphocytes are added to the fluid, before emptying ultimately into the right or the left subclavian vein, where it mixes with central venous blood.

Steam and liquid water are two different forms of the same chemical (pure) substance: water. 
A chemical compound is a chemical substance composed of many identical molecules (or molecular entities) containing atoms from more than one chemical element held together by chemical bonds. A molecule consisting of atoms of only one element is therefore not a compound. A compound can be transformed into a different substance by a chemical reaction, which may involve interactions with other substances.

A holiday is a day set aside by custom or by law on which normal activities, especially business or work including school, are suspended or reduced. Generally, holidays are intended to allow individuals to celebrate or commemorate an event or tradition of cultural or religious significance. Holidays may be designated by governments, religious institutions, or other groups or organizations. 
Agriculture or farming is the practice of cultivating plants and livestock.[1] Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago. 
Sheep, goats, pigs and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output, though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture. 
Molefi Nathanael Oliphant (6 March 1952) is a South African sports and football administrator. 
Molefi has held various positions in local and internal football structures, including the National Olympic Committe of South Africa, Council of Southern African Football Association (COSAFA) and the International Federation of Football Associations (FIFA). 
Molefi was one of the key instrumental figures to bring the 2010 FIFA World Cup to South Africa.

In political science, a reactionary or a reactionist is a person who holds political views that favor a return to the status quo ante, the previous political state of society, which that person believes possessed positive characteristics absent from contemporary society. As a descriptor term, reactionary derives from the ideological context of the left–right political spectrum. As an adjective, the word reactionary describes points of view and policies meant to restore a past status quo ante.[1] 
A record producer is a recording project's creative and technical leader, commanding studio time and coaching artists, and in popular genres typically creates the song's very sound and structure.[1][2][3] The record producer, or simply the producer, is likened to film director and art director.[1][3] The executive producer, on the other hand, enables the recording project through entrepreneurship, and an audio engineer operates the technology. 
The maintenance of complete and accurate medical records is a requirement of health care providers and is generally enforced as a licensing or certification prerequisite. 
Public records are documents or pieces of information that are not considered confidential and generally pertain to the conduct of government.

A world record is usually the best global and most important performance that is ever recorded and officially verified in a specific skill, sport, or other kind of activity. The book Guinness World Records and other world records organizations collates and publishes notable records of many. One of them is the World Records Union that is the unique world records register organization recognized by the Council of the Notariats of the European Union.[1] 
Destructive human processes, such as agriculture and land development, may damage or destroy potential archaeological sites.[3] Other threats to the archaeological record include natural phenomena and scavenging. Archaeology can be a destructive science for the finite resources of the archaeological record are lost to excavation. Therefore, archaeologists limit the amount of excavation that they do at each site and keep meticulous records of what is found. 
Records management, also known as records and information management, is an organizational function devoted to the management of information in an organization throughout its life cycle, from the time of creation or receipt to its eventual disposition.

Blue is one of the three primary colours in the RYB colour model (traditional colour theory), as well as in the RGB (additive) colour model.[1] It lies between violet and cyan on the spectrum of visible light. The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours; azure contains some green, while ultramarine contains some violet. 
The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering. An optical effect called Tyndall effect explains blue eyes. Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called aerial perspective. 
In the RGB color model, used to create colors on television and computer screens, yellow is a secondary color made by combining red and green at equal intensity. Carotenoids give the characteristic yellow color to autumn leaves, corn, canaries, daffodils, and lemons, as well as egg yolks, buttercups, and bananas. They absorb light energy and protect plants from photo damage in some cases.[1] Sunlight has a slight yellowish hue when the Sun is near the horizon, due to atmospheric scattering of shorter wavelengths (green, blue, and violet). 
The digital economy is a portmanteau of digital computing and economy, and is an umbrella term that describes how traditional brick-and-mortar economic activities (production, distribution, trade) are being transformed by Internet, World Wide Web, and blockchain technologies.[1][2][3] The digital economy is variously known as the Internet Economy, Web Economy, Cryptoeconomy, and New Economy. 
Since the digital economy is continuously replacing and expanding the traditional economy, there is no clear delineation between the two integrated economy types. The digital economy results from billions of daily online transactions among people, organizations (businesses, educational institutions, non-profits), and distributed computing devices (servers, laptops, smartphones, etc.) enabled by Internet, World Wide Web, and blockchain technologies. The digital economy is rapidly evolving into an Internet of Things (IoT), and could not exist in its current form without the Internet.[4]

A calculation is a deliberate mathematical process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more outputs or results. The term is used in a variety of senses, from the very definite arithmetical calculation of using an algorithm, to the vague heuristics of calculating a strategy in a competition, or calculating the chance of a successful relationship between two people.

In biology, the word gene (from Greek: γένος, génos;[1] meaning generation[2] or birth[1] or gender) can have several different meanings. The Mendelian gene is a basic unit of heredity and the molecular gene is a sequence of nucleotides in DNA that is transcribed to produce a functional RNA. There are two types of molecular genes: protein-coding genes and noncoding genes.[3][4][5][6] 
In particle physics, a baryon is a type of composite subatomic particle which contains an odd number of valence quarks (at least 3).[1] Baryons belong to the hadron family of particles; hadrons are composed of quarks. Baryons are also classified as fermions because they have half-integer spin. 
A quark (/kwɔːrk, kwɑːrk/) is a type of elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei.[1] All commonly observable matter is composed of up quarks, down quarks and electrons. Owing to a phenomenon known as color confinement, quarks are never found in isolation; they can be found only within hadrons, which include baryons (such as protons and neutrons) and mesons, or in quark–gluon plasmas.[2][3][nb 1] For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of hadrons. 
A hadron is a composite subatomic particle. Every hadron must fall into one of the two fundamental classes of particle, bosons and fermions 
A gluon (/ˈɡluːɒn/ GLOO-on) is an elementary particle that acts as the exchange particle (or gauge boson) for the strong force between quarks. It is analogous to the exchange of photons in the electromagnetic force between two charged particles.[1] Gluons bind quarks together, forming hadrons such as protons and neutrons. 
Racism is the belief that groups of humans possess different behavioral traits corresponding to inherited attributes and can be divided based on the superiority of one race over another.[1][1][2] It may also mean prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against other people because they are of a different race or ethnicity.[1] Modern variants of racism are often based in social perceptions of biological differences between peoples. 
These views can take the form of social actions, practices or beliefs, or political systems in which different races are ranked as inherently superior or inferior to each other, based on presumed shared inheritable traits, abilities, or qualities.[1][3] There have been attempts to legitimize racist beliefs through scientific means, such as scientific racism, which have been overwhelmingly shown to be unfounded. In terms of political systems (e.g. apartheid) that support the expression of prejudice or aversion in discriminatory practices or laws, racist ideology may include associated social aspects such as nativism, xenophobia, otherness, segregation, hierarchical ranking, and supremacism.

Green hydrogen (GH2 or GH2) is hydrogen generated by renewable energy[1] or from low-carbon power.[2] Green hydrogen has significantly lower carbon emissions than grey hydrogen, which is produced by steam reforming of natural gas, which makes up the bulk of the hydrogen market. 
Green hydrogen produced by the electrolysis of water is less than 0.1% of total hydrogen production.[3] It may be used to decarbonize sectors which are hard to electrify, such as steel and cement production, and thus help to limit climate change. 
Renewable energy capacity additions in 2020 expanded by more than 45% from 2019, including 90% more new wind power (green) and a 23% expansion of new solar photovoltaic installations (yellow).[1] 
Minimum human intervention is required to control many large facilities, such as this electrical generating station. 
The hydrogen economy is using hydrogen to decarbonize economic sectors which are hard to electrify,[1] essentially, the "hard-to-abate" sectors such as cement, steel, long-haul transport etc.[2] In order to phase out fossil fuels and limit climate change, hydrogen can be created from water using renewable sources such as wind and solar, and its combustion only releases water vapor to the atmosphere.[3][4] 
The elementary charge, usually denoted by e is the electric charge carried by a single proton or, equivalently, the magnitude of the negative electric charge carried by a single electron, which has charge −1 e.[1] This elementary charge is a fundamental physical constant.

It is sometimes called Western chess or international chess to distinguish it from related games, such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). The current form of the game emerged in Spain and the rest of Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from chaturanga, a similar but much older game of Indian origin. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide.

Bacteria are vital in many stages of the nutrient cycle by recycling nutrients such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere. The nutrient cycle includes the decomposition of dead bodies; bacteria are responsible for the putrefaction stage in this process. In the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, extremophile bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide and methane, to energy. 
Pathogenic bacteria are bacteria that can cause disease.[1] This article focuses on the bacteria that are pathogenic to humans. 
Most species of bacteria are harmless and are often beneficial but others can cause infectious diseases. The number of these pathogenic species in humans is estimated to be fewer than a hundred.[2] By contrast, several thousand species are part of the gut flora present in the digestive tract.

Egyptian hieroglyphs (/ˈhaɪrəˌɡlɪfs/, /ˈhaɪroʊˌɡlɪfs/)[5][6] were the formal writing system used in Ancient Egypt, used for writing the Egyptian language. Hieroglyphs combined logographic, syllabic and alphabetic elements, with some 1,000 distinct characters.[1][2] Cursive hieroglyphs were used for religious literature on papyrus and wood. The later hieratic and demotic Egyptian scripts were derived from hieroglyphic writing, as was the Proto-Sinaitic script that later evolved into the Phoenician alphabet.[3] Through the Phoenician alphabet's major child systems (the Greek and Aramaic scripts), the Egyptian hieroglyphic script is ancestral to the majority of scripts in modern use, most prominently the Latin and Cyrillic scripts (through Greek) and the Arabic script, and possibly the Brahmic family of scripts (through Aramaic, Phoenician, and Greek).

The history of artificial intelligence (AI) began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. The seeds of modern AI were planted by philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols.This work culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain. 
The term dialect (from Latin dialectus, dialectos, from the Ancient Greek word διάλεκτος, diálektos 'discourse', from διά, diá 'through' and λέγω, légō 'I speak') can refer to either of two distinctly different types of linguistic phenomena:

Palm wine, known by several local names, is an alcoholic beverage created from the sap of various species of palm tree such as the palmyra, date palms, and coconut palms.[1][2] It is known by various names in different regions and is common in various parts of Africa, the Caribbean, South America, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Micronesia. 
The name comes from the old Portuguese word coco, meaning "head" or "skull", after the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features. They are ubiquitous in coastal tropical regions and are a cultural icon of the tropics. 
A utopia (/juːˈtoʊpiə/ yoo-TOH-pee-ə) typically describes an imaginary community or society that possesses highly desirable or nearly perfect qualities for its members.[1] It was coined by Sir Thomas More for his 1516 book Utopia, describing a fictional island society in the New World. However, it may also denote an intentional community. In common parlance, the word or its adjectival form may be used synonymously with "impossible", "far-fetched" or "deluded".

A nonprofit is subject to the non-distribution constraint: any revenues that exceed expenses must be committed to the organization's purpose, not taken by private parties. An array of organizations are nonprofit, including some political organizations, schools, business associations, churches, social clubs, and consumer cooperatives. Nonprofit entities may seek approval from governments to be tax-exempt, and some may also qualify to receive tax-deductible contributions, but an entity may incorporate as a nonprofit entity without securing tax-exempt status. 
Transport (in British English), or transportation (in American English), is the intentional movement of humans, animals, and goods from one location to another. Modes of transport include air, land (rail and road), water, cable, pipeline, and space. The field can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles, and operations.

Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing and building an executable computer program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem.

Flowchart of an algorithm (Euclid's algorithm) for calculating the greatest common divisor (g.c.d.) of two numbers a and b in locations named A and B. The algorithm proceeds by successive subtractions in two loops: IF the test B ≥ A yields "yes" or "true" (more accurately, the number b in location B is greater than or equal to the number a in location A) THEN, the algorithm specifies B ← B − A (meaning the number b − a replaces the old b). Similarly, IF A > B, THEN A ← A − B. The process terminates when (the contents of) B is 0, yielding the g.c.d. in A.

An analog signal is any continuous signal representing some other quantity, i.e., analogous to another quantity. For example, in an analog audio signal, the instantaneous signal voltage varies continuously with the pressure of the sound waves.[1] 
Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night, but their immense distances from Earth make them appear as fixed points of light. The most prominent stars have been categorised into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations.

A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, dark matter, bound together by gravity.[1][2] The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million stars,[3] range in size from dwarfs with less than a hundred million stars, to the largest galaxies known – supergiants with one hundred trillion stars,[4] each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter, with only a few percent of that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae.

The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between fluorine and bromine in the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent: among the elements, it has the highest electron affinity and the third-highest electronegativity on the revised Pauling scale, behind only oxygen and fluorine. 
Fluorine is a chemical element with the symbol F and atomic number 9. It is the lightest halogen and exists at standard conditions as a highly toxic, pale yellow diatomic gas. As the most electronegative reactive element, it is extremely reactive, as it reacts with all other elements except for the light inert gases. 
It is the third-lightest element in group 17 of the periodic table (halogens) and is a volatile red-brown liquid at room temperature that evaporates readily to form a similarly coloured vapour. Its properties are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. Isolated independently by two chemists, Carl Jacob Löwig (in 1825) and Antoine Jérôme Balard (in 1826), its name was derived from the Ancient Greek βρῶμος (bromos) meaning "stench", referring to its sharp and pungent smell. 
Iodine is a chemical element with the symbol I and atomic number 53. The heaviest of the stable halogens, it exists as a semi-lustrous, non-metallic solid at standard conditions that melts to form a deep violet liquid at 114 °C (237 °F), and boils to a violet gas at 184 °C (363 °F). The element was discovered by the French chemist Bernard Courtois in 1811 and was named two years later by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, after the Ancient Greek Ιώδης 'violet-coloured'. 
It is the rarest naturally occurring element in the Earth's crust, occurring only as the decay product of various heavier elements. All of astatine's isotopes are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.1 hours. A sample of the pure element has never been assembled, because any macroscopic specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity. 
Tennessine is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol Ts and atomic number 117. It is the second-heaviest known element and the penultimate element of the 7th period of the periodic table.

A digital image is an image composed of picture elements, also known as pixels, each with finite, discrete quantities of numeric representation for its intensity or gray level that is an output from its two-dimensional functions fed as input by its spatial coordinates denoted with x, y on the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.[1] Depending on whether the image resolution is fixed, it may be of vector or raster type. By itself, the term "digital image" usually refers to raster images or bitmapped images (as opposed to vector images).[citation needed] 
Cabbage, comprising several cultivars of Brassica oleracea, is a leafy green, red (purple), or white (pale green) biennial plant grown as an annual vegetable crop for its dense-leaved heads. It is descended from the wild cabbage (B. oleracea var. oleracea), and belongs to the "cole crops" or brassicas, meaning it is closely related to broccoli and cauliflower (var. botrytis); Brussels sprouts (var. gemmifera); and Savoy cabbage (var. sabauda). 
Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) is an edible green plant in the cabbage family (family Brassicaceae, genus Brassica) whose large flowering head, stalk and small associated leaves are eaten as a vegetable. Broccoli is classified in the Italica cultivar group of the species Brassica oleracea. Broccoli has large flower heads, usually dark green, arranged in a tree-like structure branching out from a thick stalk which is usually light green.

It is of the order Caryophyllales, family Amaranthaceae, subfamily Chenopodioideae. Its leaves are a common edible vegetable consumed either fresh, or after storage using preservation techniques by canning, freezing, or dehydration. It may be eaten cooked or raw, and the taste differs considerably; the high oxalate content may be reduced by steaming. 
Iron (/ˈaɪən/) is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from Latin: ferrum) and atomic number 26. It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table. It is, by mass, the most common element on Earth, right in front of oxygen (32.1% and 30.1%, respectively), forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. 
"Computing Machinery and Intelligence" is a seminal paper written by Alan Turing on the topic of artificial intelligence. The paper, published in 1950 in Mind, was the first to introduce his concept of what is now known as the Turing test to the general public. 
An Internet bot, web robot, robot or simply bot, is a software application that runs automated tasks (scripts) over the Internet, usually with the intent to imitate human activity on the Internet, such as messaging, on a large scale.[1] An Internet bot plays the client role in a client–server model whereas the server role is usually played by web servers. 
Internet bots are able to perform tasks, that are simple and repetitive, much faster than a person could ever do. The most extensive use of bots is for web crawling, in which an automated script fetches, analyzes and files information from web servers. More than half of all web traffic is generated by bots.[2] 
Buildings of shops, hotels, and residences are common forms of property 
Private property is a legal designation for the ownership of property by non-governmental legal entities.[1] Private property is distinguishable from public property and personal property, which is owned by a state entity, and from collective or cooperative property, which is owned by a group of non-governmental entities.[2] 
Chlorine dioxide is a chemical compound with the formula ClO2 that exists as yellowish-green gas above 11 °C, a reddish-brown liquid between 11 °C and −59 °C, and as bright orange crystals below −59 °C. It is usually handled as an aqueous solution. It is also commonly used as a bleach. More recent developments have extended its applications in food processing and as a disinfectant. 
Xenon is a chemical element with the symbol Xe and atomic number 54. 
It is a dense, colorless, odorless noble gas found in Earth's atmosphere in trace amounts.[12] Although generally unreactive, it can undergo a few chemical reactions such as the formation of xenon hexafluoroplatinate, the first noble gas compound to be synthesized.[13][14][4]

A central bank, reserve bank, or monetary authority is an institution that manages the currency and monetary policy of a country or monetary union,[1] and oversees their commercial banking system. In contrast to a commercial bank, a central bank possesses a monopoly on increasing the monetary base. Most central banks also have supervisory and regulatory powers to ensure the stability of member institutions, to prevent bank runs, and to discourage reckless or fraudulent behavior by member banks.

Beryllium is a chemical element with the symbol Be and atomic number 4. 
It is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal. 
It is a divalent element that occurs naturally only in combination with other elements to form minerals. 
Notable gemstones high in beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald) and chrysoberyl. 
It is a relatively rare element in the universe, usually occurring as a product of the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. 
Within the cores of stars, beryllium is depleted as it is fused into heavier elements. 
Beryllium constitutes about 0.0004 percent by mass of Earth's crust. 
The world's annual beryllium production of 220 tons is usually manufactured by extraction from the mineral beryl, a difficult process because beryllium bonds strongly to oxygen. 
Nickel is a chemical element with symbol Ni and atomic number 28. 
It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. 
Nickel is a hard and ductile transition metal. 
Pure nickel is chemically reactive but large pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because a passivation layer of nickel oxide forms on the surface that prevents further corrosion. 
Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks,[4][5] and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.

Boron is a chemical element with the symbol B and atomic number 5. 
In its crystalline form it is a brittle, dark, lustrous metalloid; in its amorphous form it is a brown powder. 
As the lightest element of the boron group it has three valence electrons for forming covalent bonds, resulting in many compounds such as boric acid, the mineral sodium borate, and the ultra-hard crystals of boron carbide and boron nitride. 
Neon is a chemical element with the symbol Ne and atomic number 10. 
It is a noble gas.[10] Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert monatomic gas under standard conditions, with about two-thirds the density of air. 
It was discovered (along with krypton and xenon) in 1898 as one of the three residual rare inert elements remaining in dry air, after nitrogen, oxygen, argon and carbon dioxide were removed. 
Neon was the second of these three rare gases to be discovered and was immediately recognized as a new element from its bright red emission spectrum. 
The name neon is derived from the Greek word, νέον, neuter singular form of νέος (neos), meaning 'new'. 
Neon is chemically inert, and no uncharged neon compounds are known. 
The compounds of neon currently known include ionic molecules, molecules held together by van der Waals forces and clathrates.

It is responsible for overseeing the South African communications, telecommunications and broadcasting industries. The political head of the department is the Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies, who is assisted by a deputy minister. 
The coat of arms of South Africa is the main heraldic insignia of South Africa. The present coat of arms was introduced on Freedom Day, 27 April 2000, and was designed by Mr Iaan Bekker.[1] It replaced the earlier national arms, which had been in use since 1910.[2] The motto is written in the extinct |Xam, member of the Khoisan languages, and translates literally to "diverse people unite". The previous motto, in Latin, was Ex Unitate Vires, translated as "From unity, strength". 
Phobos (/ˈfoʊbɒs/; systematic designation: Mars I) is the innermost and larger of the two natural satellites of Mars,[1] the other being Deimos. The two moons were discovered in 1877 by American astronomer Asaph Hall. It is named after Phobos, the Greek god of fear and panic, who is the son of Ares (Mars) and twin brother of Deimos. 
Deimos /ˈdaɪməs/ (systematic designation: Mars II)[1] is the smaller and outermost of the two natural satellites of Mars, the other being Phobos. 
Section Nine of the Constitution of South Africa guarantees equality before the law and freedom from discrimination to the people of South Africa. 
This equality right is the first right listed in the Bill of Rights. 
It prohibits both discrimination by the government and discrimination by private persons; however, it also allows for affirmative action to be taken to redress past unfair discrimination. 
A birth certificate is a vital record that documents the birth of a person. The term "birth certificate" can refer to either the original document certifying the circumstances of the birth or to a certified copy of or representation of the ensuing registration of that birth. Depending on the jurisdiction, a record of birth might or might not contain verification of the event by such as a midwife or doctor. 
A marriage certificate (sometimes: marriage lines [citation needed]) is an official statement that two people are married. In most jurisdictions, a marriage certificate is issued by a government official only after the civil registration of the marriage.

The South African energy crisis is an ongoing period of widespread national blackouts of electricity supply. It began in the later months of 2007 and continues to the present.[1][2] The South African government-owned national power utility and primary power generator, Eskom, and various parliamentarians attributed these rolling-blackouts to insufficient generation capacity.[3] 
Americium is a synthetic radioactive chemical element with the symbol Am and atomic number 95. It is a transuranic member of the actinide series, in the periodic table located under the lanthanide element europium, and thus by analogy was named after the Americas.[1][2][3] 
Curium was first intentionally made by the team of Glenn T. Seaborg, Ralph A. James, and Albert Ghiorso in 1944, using the cyclotron at Berkeley. They bombarded the newly discovered element plutonium (the isotope 239Pu) with alpha particles. This was then sent to the Metallurgical Laboratory at University of Chicago where a tiny sample of curium was eventually separated and identified. 
It is a member of the actinide and transuranium element series. It is named after the city of Berkeley, California, the location of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory) where it was discovered in December 1949. Berkelium was the fifth transuranium element discovered after neptunium, plutonium, curium and americium. 
Californium is a radioactive chemical element with the symbol Cf and atomic number 98. The element was first synthesized in 1950 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions). It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, and has the second-highest atomic mass of all elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with the naked eye (after einsteinium). 
Einsteinium is a synthetic element with the symbol Es and atomic number 99. Einsteinium is a member of the actinide series and it is the seventh transuranium element. It was named in honor of Albert Einstein.

This produces an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere or coma surrounding the nucleus, and sometimes a tail of gas and dust gas blown out from the coma. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the outstreaming solar wind plasma acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. 
It is extremely radioactive; its most stable isotope, francium-223 (originally called actinium K after the natural decay chain in which it appears), has a half-life of only 22 minutes. It is the second-most electropositive element, behind only caesium, and is the second rarest naturally occurring element (after astatine). The isotopes of francium decay quickly into astatine, radium, and radon. 
Caesium (IUPAC spelling[1]) (or cesium in American English)[note 1] is a chemical element with the symbol Cs and atomic number 55. It is a soft, silvery-golden alkali metal with a melting point of 28.5 °C (83.3 °F), which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at or near room temperature.[note 2] Caesium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium. It is pyrophoric and reacts with water even at −116 °C (−177 °F). 
The volt (symbol: V) is the unit of electric potential, electric potential difference (voltage), and electromotive force in the International System of Units (SI).[1] It is named after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745–1827). 
Voltage, also known as electric pressure, electric tension, or (electric) potential difference, is the difference in electric potential between two points. In a static electric field, it corresponds to the work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between the two points. In the International System of Units, the derived unit for voltage is named volt.[1]: 166 
An electric field (sometimes E-field[1]) is the physical field that surrounds electrically charged particles and exerts force on all other charged particles in the field, either attracting or repelling them.[2] It also refers to the physical field for a system of charged particles.[3] Electric fields originate from electric charges and time-varying electric currents. Electric fields and magnetic fields are both manifestations of the electromagnetic field, one of the four fundamental interactions (also called forces) of nature. 
A pseudocolor image of two people taken in long-wavelength infrared (body-temperature thermal) radiation. 
It is also produced by electric arcs, Cherenkov radiation, and specialized lights, such as mercury-vapor lamps, tanning lamps, and black lights. Although long-wavelength ultraviolet is not considered an ionizing radiation because its photons lack the energy to ionize atoms, it can cause chemical reactions and causes many substances to glow or fluoresce. Many practical applications, including chemical and biological effects, derive from the way that UV radiation can interact with organic molecules. 
The antenna in the center is two vertical metal rods connected to a radio transmitter (not shown). The transmitter applies an alternating electric current to the rods, which charges them alternately positive (+) and negative (−). Loops of electric field leave the antenna and travel away at the speed of light; these are the radio waves.

The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray metal. 
Bismuth is a chemical element with the symbol Bi and atomic number 83. 
It is a post-transition metal and one of the pnictogens, with chemical properties resembling its lighter group 15 siblings arsenic and antimony. 
Elemental bismuth occurs naturally, and its sulfide and oxide forms are important commercial ores. 
The free element is 86% as dense as lead. 
It is a brittle metal with a silvery-white color when freshly produced. 
Surface oxidation generally gives samples of the metal a somewhat rosy cast. 
Further oxidation under heat can give bismuth a vividly iridescent appearance due to thin-film interference. 
Bismuth is both the most diamagnetic element and one of the least thermally conductive metals known. 
Arsenic is a chemical element with the symbol As and atomic number 33. 
Arsenic occurs in many minerals, usually in combination with sulfur and metals, but also as a pure elemental crystal. 
Arsenic is a metalloid. 
It has various allotropes, but only the gray form, which has a metallic appearance, is important to industry.

Argon is a chemical element with the symbol Ar and atomic number 18. 
It is in group 18 of the periodic table and is a noble gas.[6] Argon is the third-most abundant gas in Earth's atmosphere, at 0.934% (9340 ppmv). 
It is more than twice as abundant as water vapor (which averages about 4000 ppmv, but varies greatly), 23 times as abundant as carbon dioxide (400 ppmv), and more than 500 times as abundant as neon (18 ppmv). 
Argon is the most abundant noble gas in Earth's crust, comprising 0.00015% of the crust. 
Actinium is a chemical element with the symbol Ac and atomic number 89. 
It was first isolated by Friedrich Oskar Giesel in 1902, who gave it the name emanium; the element got its name by being wrongly identified with a substance André-Louis Debierne found in 1899 and called actinium. Actinium gave the name to the actinide series, a set of 15 elements between actinium and lawrencium in the periodic table. 
Together with polonium, radium, and radon, actinium was one of the first non-primordial radioactive elements to be isolated. 
Antimony is a chemical element with the symbol Sb (from Latin: stibium) and atomic number 51. 
A lustrous gray metalloid, it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (Sb2S3). 
Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics, often known by the Arabic name kohl.[5] The earliest known description of the metal in the West was written in 1540 by Vannoccio Biringuccio. 
Barium is a chemical element with the symbol Ba and atomic number 56. 
It is the fifth element in group 2 and is a soft, silvery alkaline earth metal. 
Because of its high chemical reactivity, barium is never found in nature as a free element. 
Calcium is a chemical element with the symbol Ca and atomic number 20. 
As an alkaline earth metal, calcium is a reactive metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer when exposed to air. 
Its physical and chemical properties are most similar to its heavier homologues strontium and barium. 
It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust, and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminium. 
The most common calcium compound on Earth is calcium carbonate, found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life; gypsum, anhydrite, fluorite, and apatite are also sources of calcium. The name derives from Latin calx "lime", which was obtained from heating limestone. 
Majority rule is the principle that the group that has the most supporters gets its way. 
It is the binary decision rule most often used in decision-making bodies, including many legislatures of democratic nations. 
The neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol n or n0 , which has a neutral (not positive or negative) charge, and a mass slightly greater than that of a proton. Protons and neutrons constitute the nuclei of atoms. Since protons and neutrons behave similarly within the nucleus, and each has a mass of approximately one atomic mass unit, they are both referred to as nucleons.[1] Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics. 
A model of the atomic nucleus showing it as a compact bundle of the two types of nucleons: protons (red) and neutrons (blue). In this diagram, protons and neutrons look like little balls stuck together, but an actual nucleus (as understood by modern nuclear physics) cannot be explained like this, but only by using quantum mechanics. In a nucleus that occupies a certain energy level (for example, the ground state), each nucleon can be said to occupy a range of locations. 
It was found that different atoms and different elementary particles, theoretically with the same amount of matter, have nonetheless different masses. Mass in modern physics has multiple definitions which are conceptually distinct, but physically equivalent. Mass can be experimentally defined as a measure of the body's inertia, meaning the resistance to acceleration (change of velocity) when a net force is applied.[1] The object's mass also determines the strength of its gravitational attraction to other bodies. 
A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program. This contrasts with external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry,[1] and specialized processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).

Krypton (from Ancient Greek: κρυπτός, romanized: kryptos 'the hidden one') is a chemical element with the symbol Kr and atomic number 36. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas that occurs in trace amounts in the atmosphere and is often used with other rare gases in fluorescent lamps. Krypton is chemically inert. 
Rubidium is the chemical element with the symbol Rb and atomic number 37. It is a very soft, whitish-grey solid in the alkali metal group, similar to potassium and caesium.[1] Rubidium is the first alkali metal in the group to have a density higher than water. On Earth, natural rubidium comprises two isotopes: 72% is a stable isotope 85Rb, and 28% is slightly radioactive 87Rb, with a half-life of 48.8 billion years—more than three times as long as the estimated age of the universe. 
An alkaline earth metal, strontium is a soft silver-white yellowish metallic element that is highly chemically reactive. The metal forms a dark oxide layer when it is exposed to air. Strontium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of its two vertical neighbors in the periodic table, calcium and barium. 
Yttrium is a chemical element with the symbol Y and atomic number 39. It is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and has often been classified as a "rare-earth element".[1] Yttrium is almost always found in combination with lanthanide elements in rare-earth minerals, and is never found in nature as a free element. 89Y is the only stable isotope, and the only isotope found in the Earth's crust. 
The word is related to Persian zargun (zircon; zar-gun, "gold-like" or "as gold").[1] It is a lustrous, grey-white, strong transition metal that closely resembles hafnium and, to a lesser extent, titanium. Zirconium is mainly used as a refractory and opacifier, although small amounts are used as an alloying agent for its strong resistance to corrosion. Zirconium forms a variety of inorganic and organometallic compounds such as zirconium dioxide and zirconocene dichloride, respectively. 
Niobium is often found in the minerals pyrochlore and columbite, hence the former name "columbium". Its name comes from Greek mythology: Niobe, daughter of Tantalus, the namesake of tantalum. The name reflects the great similarity between the two elements in their physical and chemical properties, which makes them difficult to distinguish.[2] 
Naturally occurring technetium is a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore and thorium ore, the most common source, or the product of neutron capture in molybdenum ores. This silvery gray, crystalline transition metal lies between manganese and rhenium in group 7 of the periodic table, and its chemical properties are intermediate between those of both adjacent elements. The most common naturally occurring isotope is 99Tc, in traces only. 
It has only one naturally occurring isotope: 103Rh. Naturally occurring rhodium is usually found as a free metal or as an alloy with similar metals and rarely as a chemical compound in minerals such as bowieite and rhodplumsite. It is one of the rarest and most valuable precious metals. 
He named it after the asteroid Pallas, which was itself named after the epithet of the Greek goddess Athena, acquired by her when she slew Pallas. Palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals (PGMs). They have similar chemical properties, but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them. 
Platinum is a chemical element with the symbol Pt and atomic number 78. It is a dense, malleable, ductile, highly unreactive, precious, silverish-white transition metal. Its name originates from Spanish platina, a diminutive of plata "silver".[1][2] 
Previously known as tantalium, it is named after Tantalus, a figure in Greek mythology.[1] Tantalum is a very hard, ductile, lustrous, blue-gray transition metal that is highly corrosion-resistant. It is part of the refractory metals group, which are widely used as components of strong high-melting-point alloys. It is a group 5 element, along with vanadium and niobium, and it always occurs in geologic sources together with the chemically similar niobium, mainly in the mineral groups tantalite, columbite and coltan.

Checkers[note 1] (American English), also known as draughts (/drɑːfts, dræfts/; British English), is a group of strategy board games for two players which involve diagonal moves of uniform game pieces and mandatory captures by jumping over opponent pieces. Checkers is developed from alquerque.[1] The term "checkers" derives from the checkered board which the game is played on, whereas "draughts" derives from the verb "to draw" or "to move".[2] 
Check (also checker, Brit: chequer) is a pattern of modified stripes consisting of crossed horizontal and vertical lines which form squares. The pattern typically contains two colours where a single checker (that is a single square within the check pattern) is surrounded on all four sides by a checker of a different colour. 
The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Great Britain, continental Europe, and the United States, that occurred during the period from around 1760 to about 1820–1840.[1] This transition included going from hand production methods to machines; new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes; the increasing use of water power and steam power; the development of machine tools; and the rise of the mechanized factory system. Output greatly increased, and a result was an unprecedented rise in population and in the rate of population growth. The textile industry was the first to use modern production methods,[2]: 40 and textiles became the dominant industry in terms of employment, value of output, and capital invested.

The Digital Revolution (also known as the Third Industrial Revolution) is the shift from mechanical and analogue electronic technology to digital electronics which began in the later half of the 20th century, with the adoption and proliferation of digital computers and digital record-keeping, that continues to the present day.[1] Implicitly, the term also refers to the sweeping changes brought about by digital computing and communication technologies during this period. From analogies to the Agricultural Revolution (Neolithic) and the First Industrial Revolution (1770-1840), the Digital Revolution marked the beginning of the Information Age.[2]

It is 1,344 ± 20 light-years (412.1 ± 6.1 pc) away[1][2] and is the closest region of massive star formation to Earth. The M42 nebula is estimated to be 24 light-years across (so its apparent size from Earth is approximately 1 degree). It has a mass of about 2,000 times that of the Sun. 
A light-year, alternatively spelled light year, is a large unit of length used to express astronomical distances and is equivalent to about 9.46 trillion kilometers (9.46×1012 km), or 5.88 trillion miles (5.88×1012 mi).[note 1] As defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a light-year is the distance that light travels in a vacuum in one Julian year (365.25 days).[1] Because it includes the time-measurement word "year", the term light-year is sometimes misinterpreted as a unit of time.[2] 
1879[2]) may also refer to the parent group bryophytes, which comprise liverworts, mosses, and hornworts.[3] Mosses typically form dense green clumps or mats, often in damp or shady locations. The individual plants are usually composed of simple leaves that are generally only one cell thick, attached to a stem that may be branched or unbranched and has only a limited role in conducting water and nutrients. Although some species have conducting tissues, these are generally poorly developed and structurally different from similar tissue found in vascular plants.[4] Mosses do not have seeds and after fertilisation develop sporophytes with unbranched stalks topped with single capsules containing spores. 
Rodents (from Latin rodere, 'to gnaw') are mammals of the order Rodentia (/roʊˈdɛnʃə/), which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents. They are native to all major land masses except for New Zealand, Antarctica, and several oceanic islands, though they have subsequently been introduced to most of these land masses by human activity.

The wavelength of a sine wave, λ, can be measured between any two points with the same phase, such as between crests (on top), or troughs (on bottom), or corresponding zero crossings as shown. 
Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time.[1] It is also occasionally referred to as temporal frequency for clarity, and is distinct from angular frequency. Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz) which is equal to one event per second. 
The period is the interval of time between events, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency.[2]

Its most stable isotope, 222Rn, has a half-life of only 3.8 days, making it one of the rarest elements. Since thorium and uranium are two of the most common radioactive elements on Earth, while also having three isotopes with half-lives on the order of several billion years, radon will be present on Earth long into the future despite its short half-life. The decay of radon produces many other short-lived nuclides, known as "radon daughters", ending at stable isotopes of lead.[1] 
ChatGPT[lower-alpha 1] is an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in November 2022. It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3 family of large language models and has been fine-tuned (an approach to transfer learning) using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. 
A supercomputer is a computer with a high level of performance as compared to a general-purpose computer. The performance of a supercomputer is commonly measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) instead of million instructions per second (MIPS). Since 2017, there have existed supercomputers which can perform over 1017 FLOPS (a hundred quadrillion FLOPS, 100 petaFLOPS or 100 PFLOPS).[1] For comparison, a desktop computer has performance in the range of hundreds of gigaFLOPS (1011) to tens of teraFLOPS (1013).[2][3] Since November 2017, all of the world's fastest 500 supercomputers run on Linux-based operating systems.[4] Additional research is being conducted in the United States, the European Union, Taiwan, Japan, and China to build faster, more powerful and technologically superior exascale supercomputers.[5] 
They are divided into the strepsirrhines, which include the lemurs, galagos, and lorisids, and the haplorhines, which include the tarsiers and the simians (monkeys, including apes and humans). Primates arose 85–55 million years ago first from small terrestrial mammals, which adapted to living in the trees of tropical forests: many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging environment, including large brains, visual acuity, color vision, a shoulder girdle allowing a large degree of movement in the shoulder joint, and dextrous hands. Primates range in size from Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, which weighs 30 g (1 oz), to the eastern gorilla, weighing over 200 kg (440 lb).

Electrical energy is energy related to forces on electrically-charged particles and the movement of those particles (often electrons in wires, but not always). This energy is supplied by the combination of current and electric potential (often referred to as voltage because electric potential is measured in volts) that is delivered by a circuit (e.g., provided by an electric power utility). Motion (current) is not required; for example, if there is a voltage difference in combination with charged particles, such as static electricity or a charged capacitor, the moving electrical energy is typically converted to another form of energy (e.g., thermal, motion, sound, light, radio waves, etc.).

Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve and exchange all kinds of data[1] and information. IT forms part of information and communications technology (ICT).[2] An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system — including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment — operated by a limited group of IT users. 
Natural science is one of the branches of science concerned with the description, understanding and prediction of natural phenomena, based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation.[1] Mechanisms such as peer review and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances. 
Computer engineering (CoE or CpE) is a branch of electrical engineering and computer science that integrates several fields of computer science and electronic engineering required to develop computer hardware and software.[1] Computer engineers not only require training in electronic engineering, software design, and hardware-software integration, but also in software engineering. 
It uses the techniques and principles of electrical engineering and computer science, but also covers areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, computer networks, computer architecture and operating systems. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work, yet it also demands them to integrate into the larger picture.[2] Robots are one of the applications of computer engineering.

In Euclidean geometry, a square is a regular quadrilateral, which means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles (90-degree angles, π/2 radian angles, or right angles). It can also be defined as a rectangle with two equal-length adjacent sides. It is the only regular polygon whose internal angle, central angle, and external angle are all equal (90°), and whose diagonals are all equal in length. 
Business is the practice of making one's living or making money by producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services).[1][2][3][4] It is also "any activity or enterprise entered into for profit."[5] 
Color blindness is a term that has been used by justices of the United States Supreme Court in several opinions relating to racial equality and social equity, particularly in public education.[1][2][3][4] The term metaphorically references the medical phenomenon of color blindness. 
A color-blind racial ideology can be defined as holding the belief that an individual's race or ethnicity should not influence how that individual is treated in society. This is further divided into two dimensions, color evasion and power evasion. Color evasion is the belief that people should not be treated differently on the basis of their color, while power evasion posits that systemic advantage based on color should have no influence on what people can accomplish, and accomplishments are instead based solely on one's own work performance.[5] 
At various times in U.S. history, individuals and groups have used this term to signal a desired or allegedly achieved state of freedom from racial prejudice or a desire that policies and laws should not explicitly consider race. It has sometimes been asserted that policies that differentiate by racial classification could tend to create, perpetuate or exacerbate racial divisiveness. 
The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved."[1] His opinion could thus be interpreted as saying that laws should not differentiate between people of different races. His opinion was not the majority-supported decision, which at the time was that laws requiring racial segregation were allowable, establishing the idea that "separate but equal" treatment was constitutionally acceptable. 
In a concurring opinion of Regents v. Bakke (1978), Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Byron White, Thurgood Marshall, and Harry Blackmun objected to the color blind term, writing that "we cannot ... let color blindness become myopia which masks the reality that many 'created equal' have been treated within our lifetimes as inferior both by the law and by their fellow citizens."[1] In her dissenting opinion to Gratz v. Bollinger (2003), Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg quoted from a 1966 5th Circuit decision:[which?] 
"'The Constitution is both color blind and color conscious. To avoid conflict with the equal protection clause, a classification that denies a benefit, causes harm, or imposes a burden must not be based on race. In that sense, the Constitution is color blind. 
But the Constitution is color conscious to prevent discrimination being perpetuated and to undo the effects of past discrimination.'"[2] In his concurring opinion to PICS v. Seattle (2007), Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that "the color-blind Constitution does not bar the government from taking measures to remedy past state-sponsored discrimination – indeed, it requires that such measures be taken in certain circumstances."[3] 
Homophobia encompasses a range of negative attitudes and feelings toward homosexuality or people who are identified or perceived as being lesbian, gay or bisexual.[1][2][3] It has been defined as contempt, prejudice, aversion, hatred or antipathy, may be based on irrational fear and may also be related to religious beliefs. Negative attitudes towards transgender and transsexual people are known as transphobia.[4][5] 
In medieval Europe, homosexuality was considered sodomy and it was punishable by death. 
Persecutions reached their height during the Medieval Inquisitions, when the sects of Cathars and Waldensians were accused of fornication and sodomy, alongside accusations of Satanism. 
In 1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges leveled during the Trial of the Knights Templar.[48] The theologian Thomas Aquinas was influential in linking condemnations of homosexuality with the idea of natural law, arguing that "special sins are against nature, as, for instance, those that run counter to the intercourse of male and female natural to animals, and so are peculiarly qualified as unnatural vices."[49] 
Although bisexuality was accepted as normal human behavior in Ancient China,[50] homophobia became ingrained in the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China due to interactions with the Christian West,[51] and homosexual behavior was outlawed in 1740.[52] During the Cultural Revolution, homosexuality was treated by the government as a "social disgrace or a form of mental illness", and individuals who were homosexual widely faced persecution. 
Although there were no laws specifically against homosexuality, other laws were used to prosecute homosexual people and they were "charged with hooliganism or disturbing public order."[53][better source needed] 
The Soviet Union under Vladimir Lenin decriminalized homosexuality in 1922, long before many other European countries. 
The Soviet Communist Party effectively legalized no-fault divorce, abortion and homosexuality, when they abolished all the old Tsarist laws and the initial Soviet criminal code kept these liberal sexual policies in place.[54] Lenin's emancipation was reversed a decade later by Joseph Stalin and homosexuality remained illegal under Article 121 until the Yeltsin era. 
Homophobia is observable in critical and hostile behavior such as discrimination and violence on the basis of sexual orientations that are non-heterosexual.[1][2][6] Recognized types of homophobia include institutionalized homophobia, e.g. religious homophobia and state-sponsored homophobia, and internalized homophobia, experienced by people who have same-sex attractions, regardless of how they identify.[7][8] 
Negative attitudes toward identifiable LGBT groups have similar yet specific names: lesbophobia is the intersection of homophobia and sexism directed against lesbians, gayphobia is the dislike or hatred of gay men, biphobia targets bisexuality and bisexual people, and transphobia targets transgender and transsexual people and gender variance or gender role nonconformity.[9][2][3][10] According to 2010 Hate Crimes Statistics released by the FBI National Press Office, 19.3 percent of hate crimes across the United States "were motivated by a sexual orientation bias."[11] Moreover, in a Southern Poverty Law Center 2010 Intelligence Report extrapolating data from fourteen years (1995–2008), which had complete data available at the time, of the FBI's national hate crime statistics found that LGBT people were "far more likely than any other minority group in the United States to be victimized by violent hate crime."[12] 
Etymology 
Although sexual attitudes tracing back to Ancient Greece – from the 8th to 6th centuries BC to the end of antiquity (c. 600 AD) – have been termed homophobia by scholars, and it is used to describe an intolerance towards homosexuality and homosexuals that grew during the Middle Ages, especially by adherents of Islam and Christianity,[13] the term itself is relatively new.[14] 
Coined by George Weinberg, a psychologist, in the 1960s,[15] the term homophobia is a blend of (1) the word homosexual, itself a mix of neo-classical morphemes, and (2) phobia from the Greek φόβος, phóbos, meaning "fear", "morbid fear" or "aversion".[16][17][18] Weinberg is credited as the first person to have used the term in speech.[5] The word homophobia first appeared in print in an article written for the May 23, 1969, edition of the American pornographic magazine Screw, in which the word was used to refer to heterosexual men's fear that others might think they are gay.[14] 
"Poor white trash", then, is the term applied to the "bad poor", not the romanticized "noble and hardworking" "good poor"[1] One word applied to such people was "tackeys" or "tackies".[13] According to the Oxford Dictionaries, it was once applied to horses of little or no value, then was transferred to people seen to have little or no value.[14] There may have been an intermediate time when it was used to describe those who may have been wealthy but had no family roots or good breeding.[15] It now generally refers to anything that is cheap, shoddy, gaudy, seedy, or in bad taste.[16] 
In White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America, historian Nancy Isenberg compiled a long, but hardly definitive, list of derisive names that have been used to refer to poor whites: 
This poor white family from Alabama was presented in 1913 as "celebrities" because they had escaped the debilitating effects of hookworm disease, which, along with pellagra was endemic among poor Southern whites due to poor sanitation and the phenomenon of "clay eating" or "dirt eating" (geophagia). 
White trash is a derogatory racial and class-related slur[1][2] used in American English to refer to poor white people, especially in the rural areas of the southern United States. The label signifies a social class inside the white population and especially a degraded standard of living.[3] It is used as a way to separate the "noble and hardworking" "good poor" from the lazy, "undisciplined, ungrateful and disgusting" "bad poor". 
The use of the term provides middle- and upper-class whites a means of distancing themselves from the poverty and powerlessness of poor whites, who cannot enjoy those privileges, as well as a way to disown their perceived behavior.[1] 
The term has been adopted for people living on the fringes of the social order, who are seen as dangerous because they may be criminal, unpredictable, and without respect for political, legal, or moral authority.[4] While the term is mostly used pejoratively by urban and middle-class whites as a class signifier,[5] some white entertainers self-identify as "white trash", considering it a badge of honor, and celebrate the stereotypes and social marginalization of lower-class whiteness.[1][6][7][8] 
Scholars from the late 19th to the early 21st century explored generations of families who were considered "disreputable", such as the Jukes family and the Kallikak family, both pseudonyms for real families.[11] 
In phenomenology, the terms the Other and the Constitutive Other identify the other human being, in their differences from the Self, as being a cumulative, constituting factor in the self-image of a person; as acknowledgement of being real; hence, the Other is dissimilar to and the opposite of the Self, of Us, and of the Same.[1][2] The Constitutive Other is the relation between the personality (essential nature) and the person (body) of a human being; the relation of essential and superficial characteristics of personal identity that corresponds to the relationship between opposite, but correlative, characteristics of the Self, because the difference is inner-difference, within the Self.[3][4] 
The term Othering describes the reductive action of labelling and defining a person as a subaltern native, as someone who belongs to the socially subordinate category of the Other. 
The practice of Othering excludes persons who do not fit the norm of the social group, which is a version of the Self;[7] likewise, in human geography, the practice of othering persons means to exclude and displace them from the social group to the margins of society, where mainstream social norms do not apply to them, for being the Other.[8] 
Cultural assimilation is the process in which a minority group or culture comes to resemble a society's majority group or assimilate the values, behaviors, and beliefs of another group whether fully or partially.[1] 
The different types of cultural assimilation include full assimilation and forced assimilation; full assimilation being the most prevalent of the two, as it occurs spontaneously.[2] 
During cultural assimilation, minority groups are expected to adapt to the everyday practices of the dominant culture through language and appearance as well as via more significant socioeconomic factors such as absorption into the local cultural and employment community.[3] 
A conceptualization describes cultural assimilation as similar to acculturation[4][5] while another merely considers the former as one of the latter's phases.[3] Throughout history there have been different forms of cultural assimilation examples of types of acculturation include voluntary and involuntary assimilation.[4] 
Another view of cultural appropriation is that calling upon it to criticise is "a deeply conservative project", despite progressive roots, that "first seeks to preserve in formaldehyde the content of an established culture and second tries [to] prevent others from interacting with that culture".[37] For example, the film Star Wars used elements from Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, which itself used elements from Shakespeare; culture in the aggregate is arguably better off for each instance of appropriation. 
Fusion between cultures has produced such foods as American Chinese cuisine, modern Japanese sushi, and bánh mì, each of which is sometimes argued to reflect part of its respective culture's identity.[37] 
Cultural appropriation[1][2] is the inappropriate or unacknowledged adoption of an element or elements of one culture or identity by members of another culture or identity.[3][4][5] This can be especially controversial when members of a dominant culture appropriate from minority cultures.[1][6][7] According to critics of the practice, cultural appropriation differs from acculturation, assimilation, or equal cultural exchange in that this appropriation is a form of colonialism. 
When cultural elements are copied from a minority culture by members of a dominant culture, and these elements are used outside of their original cultural context – sometimes even against the expressly stated wishes of members of the originating culture – the practice is often received negatively.[8][9][10][11][12][excessive citations] 
Cultural appropriation is considered harmful by various groups and individuals,[13] including Indigenous people working for cultural preservation,[14][3] those who advocate for collective intellectual property rights of the originating, minority cultures,[16][17][18][19][excessive citations] and those who have lived or are living under colonial rule.[8][20][21][19][excessive citations] Cultural appropriation can include exploitation of another culture's religious and cultural traditions, dance steps, fashion, symbols, language, and music.[22] 
Those who see this appropriation as exploitative state that cultural elements are lost or distorted when they are removed from their originating cultural contexts, and that such displays are disrespectful or even a form of desecration.[1] Cultural elements that may have deep meaning to the original culture may be reduced to "exotic" fashion or toys by those from the dominant culture.[8][2][23] Kjerstin Johnson has written that, when this is done, the imitator, "who does not experience that oppression is able to 'play', temporarily, an 'exotic' other, without experiencing any of the daily discriminations faced by other cultures".[23] The black American academic, musician and journalist Greg Tate argued that appropriation and the "fetishising" of cultures, in fact, alienates those whose culture is being appropriated.[24] 
The concept of cultural appropriation has also been subject to heavy criticism and debate.[25][26][27] Critics note that the concept is often misunderstood or misapplied by the general public, and that charges of "cultural appropriation" are at times misapplied to situations such as trying food from a different culture or learning about different cultures.[28][29] Others state that the act of cultural appropriation as it is usually defined does not meaningfully constitute social harm, or the term lacks conceptual coherence.[6][7] Additionally, the term can set arbitrary limits on intellectual freedom, artists' self-expression, reinforce group divisions, or promote a feeling of enmity or grievance rather than of liberation.[31][32][33][34][26][excessive citations] 
Cultural appropriation can involve the use of ideas, symbols, artifacts, or other aspects of human-made visual or non-visual culture.[36] As a concept that is controversial in its applications, the propriety of cultural appropriation has been the subject of much debate. 
Opponents of cultural appropriation view many instances as wrongful appropriation when the subject culture is a minority culture or is subordinated in social, political, economic, or military status to the dominant culture[2] or when there are other issues involved, such as a history of ethnic or racial conflict.[3] Linda Martín Alcoff writes that this is often seen in cultural outsiders' use of an oppressed culture's symbols or other cultural elements, such as music, dance, spiritual ceremonies, modes of dress, speech, and social behaviour when these elements are trivialized and used for fashion, rather than respected within their original cultural context. 
Opponents view the issues of colonialism, context, and the difference between appropriation and mutual exchange as central to analyzing cultural appropriation. 
They argue that mutual exchange happens on an "even playing field", whereas appropriation involves pieces of an oppressed culture being taken out of context by a people who have historically oppressed those they are taking from, and who lack the cultural context to properly understand, respect, or utilize these elements.[9][4] 
Garlic (Allium sativum) is a species of bulbous flowering plant in the genus Allium. Its close relatives include the onion, shallot, leek, chive,[1] Welsh onion and Chinese onion.[2] It is native to South Asia, Central Asia and northeastern Iran and has long been used as a seasoning worldwide, with a history of several thousand years of human consumption and use.[3][4] It was known to ancient Egyptians and has been used as both a food flavoring and a traditional medicine.[5][6] China produces 76% of the world's supply of garlic.[7] 
A large language model (LLM) is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabelled text using self-supervised learning. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.[1] 
A language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words.[1] Given any sequence of words of length m, a language model assigns a probability P ( w 1 , … , w m ) {\displaystyle P(w_{1},\ldots ,w_{m})} to the whole sequence. 
Language models generate probabilities by training on text corpora in one or many languages. Given that languages can be used to express an infinite variety of valid sentences (the property of digital infinity), language modeling faces the problem of assigning non-zero probabilities to linguistically valid sequences that may never be encountered in the training data. Several modelling approaches have been designed to surmount this problem, such as applying the Markov assumption or using neural architectures such as recurrent neural networks or transformers. 
A generative artificial intelligence or generative AI is a type of AI system capable of generating text, images, or other media in response to prompts.[1][2] Generative AI systems use generative models such as large language models to statistically sample new data based on the training data set that was used to create them.[3]
