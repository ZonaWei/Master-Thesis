The livers of polar bears, walruses, bearded seals, moose, and huskies can contain very high levels of preformed vitamin A,[7][8] and their consumption has led to vitamin A poisoning (hypervitaminosis A) according to several anecdotal reports and a few scientific studies.[citation needed] The Inuit will not eat the liver of polar bears or bearded seals. It has been estimated that consumption of 500 grams of polar bear liver would result in a toxic dose for a human.[9] Russian sailor Alexander Konrad, who accompanied explorer Valerian Albanov in a tragic ordeal over the Arctic ice in 1912, wrote about the awful effects of consuming polar bear liver.[10] Also, in 1913, Antarctic explorers on the Far Eastern Party Douglas Mawson and Xavier Mertz were believed to have been poisoned, the latter fatally, from eating husky liver, though this has been contested recently.[11]

"In Matthew 22:28–30, Jesus is asked about the continuing state of marriage after death and he replies that after the resurrection of the dead ""people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven."" Mormons do not interpret Jesus' statement as meaning ""that marriages will not exist after the Resurrection, but that marriages will not be performed after the Resurrection; for all questions of marital status must be settled before that time.""[9] Thus, Mormons believe that only mortals can be the subject of an eternal marriage ordinance; mortals may receive the ordinance for themselves or by proxy for those who have already died."
