While religion and the law have had a fundamental role in the historical definition and punishment of sodomy, sodomitical texts present considerable opportunities for ambiguity and interpretation. Sodomy is both a real occurrence and an imagined category. In the course of the eighteenth century, what is identifiable as sodomy often becomes identified with effeminacy, for example, or in opposition to a discourse of manliness.

Uma usebenzisa ikhambi, kubaluleke kakhulu ukuthi ungalokothi udlule inani elinconyiwe elingu-2.5 amagremu e-Prague powder # 1 ku-1 kilogram yenyama (ama-ounces angu-4/100 amakhilogremu).Ngokulinganayo lokhu kungu-10 mL ku-4.5 kg (2 amathisipuni 10 amapondo).Qaphela ukuthi inani eliphakeme elivumelekile le-sodium nitrite ne-potassium nitrite lilawulwa yimithetho futhi likhawulelwe ku-7. amagremu ngama-45 kg (0.25 ama-ounces nge-100 pounds) yenyama eqotshiwe.Njengoba i-Prague powder #1 iyi-dilution engu-1:15 (ku-0.45 kg ye-Prague powder #1 30 amagremu yi-sodium nitrite kanye nama-425 amagremu angusawoti wetafula ovamile), sithola inani elifanele ngenani elingu-114 amagremu engezwe ku- 45 kg (100 lb) yenyama.	When using cure, it is very important to never exceed the recommended amount of 2.5 grams of Prague powder #1 in 1 kilogram of meat (4 ounces/100 pounds). Equivalently this is 10 mL for 4.5 kg (2 teaspoons for 10 pounds). Note that the maximum allowable amount of sodium nitrite and potassium nitrite is governed by regulations and is limited to 7 grams per 45 kg (0.25 ounces per 100 pounds) of chopped meat.[5] Since Prague powder #1 is a 1:15 dilution (in 0.45 kg of Prague powder #1 30 grams is sodium nitrite and 425 grams are common table salt), we get the proper amount at a rate of 114 grams added to 45 kg (100 lb) of meat.

"Subsequent discussion of marital sex warned against behaviors that the church considered unnatural, impure, and unholy, including general authority Spencer J. Condie's warning that when couples ""participate in unholy practices"" during their physical intimacy it can become a ""disruptive force"" in their marriage.[48] When discussing physical intimacy, a 2003 church manual on marriage quotes church president Spencer W. Kimball, who stated that the idea that ""behind the bedroom doors anything goes"" is not true nor condoned by the Lord and ""if it is unnatural, you just don't do it"".[49] In a private letter dated May 17, 1973, church president Harold B. Lee called ""oral lovemaking"" a ""degrading"" ""perversion"" that was ""abhorrent in the sight of the Lord"".[50][51][52] In a popular book sold by the church's bookstore and cowritten by a BYU professor, the authors state that oral sex is unworthy and impure for married couples.[53][54][55] An LDS magazine published a bishop's teaching in 2013 that oral sex was forbidden before marriage.[56] Two BYU graduate Mormon sex therapists, however, publicly stated in 2013 that oral sex was acceptable for married couples[57] as did another LDS therapist in 2014.[58]"

"Mormon fundamentalists believe that plural marriage is a requirement for exaltation and entry into the highest level of the celestial kingdom.

Lo mqondo wehlukile kuMfundiso kaZiqu-zintathu wamaKhristu ngezindlela eziningi, enye yazo ngukuthi iMormonism ayizange yamukele noma iqhubeke nokubamba imfundiso yeSivumo Sokholo saseNicaea, ukuthi uYise, iNdodana noMoya oNgcwele bangabantu noma into efanayo.Futhi, iMormonism ifundisa ukuthi ukuhlakanipha okuhlala kumuntu ngamunye kuhlangene noNkulunkulu.

This conception differs from the traditional Christian Trinity in several ways, one of which is that Mormonism has not adopted or continued to hold the doctrine of the Nicene Creed, that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are of the same substance or being.[1] Also, Mormonism teaches that the intelligence dwelling in each human is coeternal with God.[32] Mormons use the term omnipotent to describe God, and regard him as the creator: they understand him as being almighty and eternal but subject to eternal natural law which governs intelligences, justice and the eternal nature of matter (ie God organized the world but did not create it from nothing).[33] The Mormon conception of God also differs substantially from the Jewish tradition of ethical monotheism in which elohim (אֱלֹהִים) is a completely different conception.

Ned Cuthbert, playing for the Philadelphia Keystones in either 1863 or 1865, was the first player to steal a base in a baseball game, although the term stolen base was not used until 1870.[2] For a time in the 19th century, stolen bases were credited when a baserunner reached an extra base on a base hit from another player.[3] For example, if a runner on first base reached third base on a single, it counted as a steal. In 1887, Hugh Nicol set a still-standing Major League record with 138 stolen bases,[4] many of which would not have counted under modern rules.[3] Modern steal rules were fully implemented in 1898.[5]
