"In Matthew 22:28–30, Jesus is asked about the continuing state of marriage after death and he replies that after the resurrection of the dead ""people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven."" Mormons do not interpret Jesus' statement as meaning ""that marriages will not exist after the Resurrection, but that marriages will not be performed after the Resurrection; for all questions of marital status must be settled before that time.""[9] Thus, Mormons believe that only mortals can be the subject of an eternal marriage ordinance; mortals may receive the ordinance for themselves or by proxy for those who have already died."

This export approval was presumably made possible because a) the CryptoAPI implementation requires third party CSPs to be digitally signed by Microsoft and rejects attempts to call CSPs not so signed; b) through this signing process Microsoft can ensure compliance with the relevant US export control regulations (e.g., they presumably would not sign a CSP developed outside the US that implements strong cryptography); and c) Microsoft's CryptoAPI implementation is available only in executable form, and thus is presumed to be reasonably resistant to user tampering to disable the CSP digital signature check.[7]"

Ukuzihlobisa komzimba kusanda kuba yindaba yocwaningo olunzulu ngabafundi bemivubukulo, abavinjelwe ukutadisha ukubhoboza umzimba ngokushoda kwemithombo eyinhloko.Amarekhodi okuqala ayeqabukela exoxa ngokusetshenziswa kokubhoboza noma okuchazayo, kanti ngenkathi ubucwebe buvamile phakathi kwempahla emikhulu, ukonakala kwenyama eyayikade ihlobisile kwenza kube nzima ukubona ukuthi ubucwebe kungenzeka busetshenziswe kanjani. [1] Futhi, irekhodi lesimanje livuselelwe ngokwakhiwa kwekhulu lama-20 lomthandi womdlandla wokubhoboza uDoug Malloy .

Body adornment has only recently become a subject of serious scholarly research by archaeologists, who have been hampered in studying body piercing by a scarcity of primary sources.[1] Early records rarely discussed the use of piercings or their meaning, and while jewellery is common among grave goods, the deterioration of the flesh that it once adorned makes it difficult to discern how the jewellery may have been used.[1] Also, the modern record has been vitiated with the 20th-century inventions of piercing enthusiast Doug Malloy.[1] In the 1960s and 1970s, Malloy marketed contemporary body piercing by giving it the patina of history.[2] His pamphlet Body & Genital Piercing in Brief included such commonly reproduced urban legends as the notion that Prince Albert invented the piercing that shares his name in order to diminish the appearance of his large penis in tight trousers, and that Roman centurions attached their capes to nipple piercings.[3][4] Some of Malloy's myths are reprinted as fact in subsequently published histories of piercing.[1]

Until at least the mid-1960s, many English-language writers used the term Mohammedans or Mahometans.[88] Although such terms were not necessarily intended to be pejorative, Muslims argue that the terms are offensive because they allegedly imply that Muslims worship Muhammad rather than God.[89] Other obsolete terms include Muslimite[90] and Muslimist.[91]

The opening of the foreskin is now normally wide enough for the foreskin to be easily retracted. The foreskin is also slightly shorter (by half the length of the longitudinal incisions which are now closed transversely) because the widening of the phimotic ring takes up some foreskin length. Studies from a large cohort in the Indian Subcontinent show a good acceptance and an interest for foreskin preservation when there is no religious indication to remove the foreskin.

Smoking is primarily practised as a route of administration for recreational drug use because the combustion of the dried plant leaves vaporizes and delivers active substances into the lungs where they are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and reach bodily tissue. In the case of cigarette smoking these substances are contained in a mixture of aerosol particles and gases and include the pharmacologically active alkaloid nicotine; the vaporization creates heated aerosol and gas into a form that allows inhalation and deep penetration into the lungs where absorption into the bloodstream of the active substances occurs. In some cultures, smoking is also carried out as a part of various rituals, where participants use it to help induce trance-like states that, they believe, can lead them to spiritual enlightenment.

Despite early inroads of school-based sex education, most of the information on sexual matters in the mid-20th century was obtained informally from friends and the media, and much of this information was deficient or of dubious value, especially during the period following puberty, when curiosity about sexual matters was the most acute. This deficiency was heightened by the increasing incidence of teenage pregnancies, particularly in Western countries after the 1960s. As part of each country's efforts to reduce such pregnancies, programs of sex education were introduced, initially over strong opposition from parent and religious groups.

These time intervals would seem to be reversed; this is an area where public policy trumps science. The idea is that for women beyond age 35, every month counts and if made to wait another six months to prove the necessity of medical intervention, the problem could become worse. The corollary to this is that, by definition, failure to conceive in women under 35 isn't regarded with the same urgency as it is in those over 35.

The Tumbuka language suffered during the rule of President Hastings Kamuzu Banda, since in 1968 as a result of his one-nation, one-language policy it lost its status as an official language in Malawi. As a result, Tumbuka was removed from the school curriculum, the national radio, and the print media.[8] With the advent of multi-party democracy in 1994, Tumbuka programmes were started again on the radio, but the number of books and other publications in Tumbuka remains low.[9]

"Abaholi abaningi beSonto LDS baveze imibono yabo ngendaba yenyama.Ngo-1868, umongameli wesonto uBrigham Young weluleka, ""Inyama kufanele isetshenziswe kancane, endlaleni nasemakhazeni."" [1] Ngo-1868, umphostoli uGeorge Q. Cannon wathi, ""Sitshelwa ukuthi inyama yanoma yiluphi uhlobo ayifaneleki kumuntu ngesikhathi sasehlobo, futhi kufanele idliwe kancane ebusika."" [2] Kusukela ngo-1897 kuya ku-1901, umphostoli owayengumongameli wesonto uLorenzo Snow ngokuphindaphindiwe wakugcizelela ukubaluleka kokudla inyama ngokuyonga, efundisa ukuthi amalungu esonto kufanele agweme ukudla inyama ngaphandle kwalapho kunesidingo esikhulu, nokuthi lokhu kufanele kubonakale ngokulandela imfundiso kaSmith yokuthi izilwane. banemimoya. [3] Ngo-1895, u-Snow wathi, ""Ngaphandle kokuthi indlala noma amakhaza ahlasele kufanele sikugweme ukusebenzisa inyama."" [4] Umpostoli uGeorge Teasdale wafundisa into efanayo, futhi wabamba ukuthi ukudla ingulube kwakuwukwephula okukhulu kweZwi Lokuhlakanipha kunokuphuza itiye noma ikhofi. [3] Lapho uJoseph F. Smith elandela u-Snow njengomongameli webandla ngo-1901, wayeshumayela njalo ngokumelene “nokubhujiswa okungadingekile kokuphila”, futhi wagcizelela umusa ezilwaneni kanye nobuphathi obubalulekile abantu abanabo kubo ."	"In 1868, church president Brigham Young counseled, ""Flesh should be used sparingly, in famine and in cold.""[43] In 1868, apostle George Q. Cannon said, ""We are told that flesh of any kind is not suitable to man in the summer time, and ought to be eaten sparingly in the winter.""[44] From 1897 to 1901, apostle and then church president Lorenzo Snow repeatedly emphasized the importance of eating meat sparingly, teaching that church members should refrain from eating meat except in case of dire necessity, and that this should be seen in light of Smith's teaching that animals have spirits.[3] In 1895, Snow stated, ""Unless famine or extreme cold is upon us we should refrain from the use of meat.""[46] Apostle George Teasdale taught the same thing, and held that eating pork was a more serious breach of the Word of Wisdom than drinking tea or coffee.[45] When Joseph F. Smith succeeded Snow as president of the church in 1901, he preached regularly against the ""unnecessary destruction of life"", and emphasized kindness to animals and the important stewardship humans have toward them .[47]"

"Responding to the unrest, the government implemented state of emergency measures, declaring martial law and banning the ANC and PAC, while in March they arrested Mandela and other activists, imprisoning them for five months without charge in the unsanitary conditions of the Pretoria Local prison.[106] Imprisonment caused problems for Mandela and his co-defendants in the Treason Trial; their lawyers could not reach them, and so it was decided that the lawyers would withdraw in protest until the accused were freed from prison when the state of emergency was lifted in late August 1960.[107] Over the following months, Mandela used his free time to organise an All-In African Conference near Pietermaritzburg, Natal, in March 1961, at which 1,400 anti-apartheid delegates met, agreeing on a stay-at-home strike to mark 31 May, the day South Africa became a republic.[108] On 29 March 1961, six years after the Treason Trial began, the judges produced a verdict of not guilty, claiming that there was insufficient evidence to convict the accused of ""high treason"" for they had not advocated either communism nor violent revolution; the outcome embarrassed the government.[109]"

"Nevertheless, many analysts said the judgment might prove a fatal blow to Zuma, although factional battles within the ANC would be the ultimate decider.[1][66][67] One suggested that powerful ANC members had lost faith in Zuma and might move to oust him at a more opportune moment.[63] The South African Communist Party, part of Zuma's own tripartite alliance, had been skeptical about the adequacy of his response to the judgment.[68] Some ANC members booed Zuma at his next subsequent appearance.[69] And several prominent members of civil society and former ANC insiders, including Ahmed Kathrada, Ronnie Kasrils, Trevor Manuel, Cheryl Carolus, and retired Constitutional Court judge Zak Yacoob, called for Zuma's resignation,[70][71][72][73] prompting a backlash from certain Zuma allies.[74] The South African Council of Churches did the same, saying Zuma had ""lost all moral authority"".[75][76] The Gauteng ANC, led by noted Zuma critic Paul Mashatile, formally resolved that Zuma must resign;[77][78] doubts were raised about Zuma's leadership even within his traditional strongholds like the ANC's Limpopo branches;[79] and an internal ANC memorandum sent by party veterans to the Top Six allegedly demanded Zuma's recall and compared him to detested apartheid-era President P. W. Botha.[76] Finally, members of the Gupta family, thought to be Zuma's long-standing allies and crucial financial backers, resigned from their major holding company and fled South Africa for Dubai in the week after the judgment – leaving Zuma, in the opinion of some analysts, extremely vulnerable.[80][81] In the wake of these developments, Malema said it was now time to ""crush the head of the snake"".[82] On 12 April 2016, Max du Preez said the key question, ""now that the balance of power has turned irrevocably against Zuma"", was how to ensure he makes a managed — and non-violent — exit.[83]"

In linguistics, phrase structure rules, also called rewrite rules, are used in some systems of generative grammar,[8] as a means of generating the grammatically correct sentences of a language. Such a rule typically takes the form A → X, where A is a syntactic category label, such as noun phrase or sentence, and X is a sequence of such labels or morphemes, expressing the fact that A can be replaced by X in generating the constituent structure of a sentence. For example, the rule S → NP VP means that a sentence can consist of a noun phrase followed by a verb phrase; further rules will specify what sub-constituents a noun phrase and a verb phrase can consist of, and so on.

Electrical energy is energy related to forces on electrically-charged particles and the movement of those particles (often electrons in wires, but not always). This energy is supplied by the combination of current and electric potential (often referred to as voltage because electric potential is measured in volts) that is delivered by a circuit (e.g., provided by an electric power utility). Motion (current) is not required; for example, if there is a voltage difference in combination with charged particles, such as static electricity or a charged capacitor, the moving electrical energy is typically converted to another form of energy (e.g., thermal, motion, sound, light, radio waves, etc.).

Further flooding then took place through open doors, chutes and hatches until the Gaul lost her reserves of buoyancy, she then sank very rapidly, stern first.[16]

"Lokhu kufinyelele entweni efana nesimo sayo samanje ngekhulu lesi-5 BCE, [30] kepha uGenesise 1-11 ukhombisa ubudlelwano obuncane kulo lonke iBhayibheli: [31] ngokwesibonelo, amagama ezinhlamvu zalo kanye nokuma kwalo - u-Adam (indoda) no-Eve (impilo), iZwe leNodi (""Ukuzulazula""), njalonjalo - kungokomfanekiso kunokuba kube ngokoqobo, futhi cishe akekho noyedwa umuntu, izindawo nezindaba okukhulunywe ngazo kuyo ezake zahlangatshezwa kwenye indawo.Lokhu kuholele ekutheni izifundiswa zicabange ukuthi uMlando wakha ukwakheka okwenziwe sekwedlule isikhathi okunamathiselwe kuGenesise nasePentateuch ukuze kusetshenziswe njengesingeniso.Ukuthi isikhathi sempikiswano sekudlule isikhathi kangakanani: kwesinye isikhathi ngokweqile yilabo abakubona kungumkhiqizo wesikhathi samaGreki, lapho kungenzeki ukuthi kube ngaphambi kwamashumi eminyaka okuqala ekhulu lesi-4 BCE; ngakolunye uhlangothi umthombo weYahwist ukhishwe ezinye izazi, ikakhulukazi uJohn Van Seters, esikhathini sangaphambi kokufika kwasePheresiya (ngekhulu lesi-6 BCE) ngokunembile ngoba iPrimeval History iqukethe ithonya eliningi laseBabiloni ngendlela yenganekwane .[Qaphela 1] Umlando wePrimeval udonsela ""emithonjeni"" emibili ehlukile, umthombo wobupristi futhi kwesinye isikhathi obizwa ngokuthi ngumthombo weYahwist futhi kwesinye isikhathi umane athi ""ongewona owabaPristi""; ngenhloso yokuxoxa ngo-Adam no-Eva eNcwadini kaGenesise amagama athi ""okungewona owabaPristi"" kanye no- ""Yahwist"" angathathwa njengokushintshana."
