Au fikiria kuhusu kila mmoja wetu tunapotembea katika jiji, tumezama katika mawazo yetu, na tumeachana na mazingira.	Or think of every one of us as we are walking around the city, we are absorbed in our thoughts, and we detach from the surroundings.
Kile kinachotokea hapa ni kwamba shighuli katika ubongo uliozalisha msongeo katika nyani huyo ulisambazwa hadi Ujapani na ukafanya roboti kutembea na ukanda ya matembezi haya ukapelekwa hadi Duke, ili nyani huyo aone miguu ya yule roboti ikitembea mbele yake.	What happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the monkey was transmitted to Japan and made this robot walk while footage of this walking was sent back to Duke, so that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her.

Nilikuwa naongea kipindi fulani hapo nyuma katika kikao cha pamoja cha bunge la Marekani	I spoke some time ago to a joint session of Congress, last year.
AG: Jibu la swali hilo ni gumu kwangu kwasababu, kwa upande mwingine, nadhani kwamba ni lazima tuone fahari kwa ukweli kwamba mgombea wa Republican – mgombea wa uhakika-- John McCain, na wagombea wote wa Democratic – wote watatu wana tofauti ya mitazamo ya namna ya kusonga mbele juu ya matatizo ya hali ya hewa. Wote watatu wameahidi kutoa mwongozo, na wote watatu wana mitazamo tofauti kutokana na msimamo wa uongozi wa sasa. Na ninadhani kuwa wote watatu wamewajibika katika kupitisha mipango na mapendekezo. Lakini mazungumzo ya kampeni -- kama yalivyofafanuliwa kwa maswali -- ambayo yalitayarishwa na Umoja wa Wapiga Kura Watunzaji wa Mazingira, mchanganuo wa maswali yote -- na, mathalani, midahalo yote imedhaminiwa na nembo ya Orwellian, “Makaa Safi.” Kuna mtu yeyote ameliona hilo?	"AG: The answer to the question is hard for me because, on the one hand, I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the Republican nominee -- certain nominee -- John McCain, and both of the finalists for the Democratic nomination -- all three have a very different and forward-leaning position on the climate crisis. All three have offered leadership, and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration. And I think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals. But the campaign dialogue that -- as illustrated by the questions -- that was put together by the League of Conservation Voters, by the way, the analysis of all the questions -- and, by the way, the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label, ""Clean Coal."" Has anybody noticed that?"
Ilihitajika.	It was demanded.

(Vicheko) Kila siku, nafanya bidii kuwazidishia wanawake sauti na kuoneysha maisha yao na michango yao katika hatua za kutafuta usalama na kutatua migogoro, na kwa sababu ya kazi zangu, natambua kwamba njia ya pekee kwa kuhakikisha ushirikiano kamili wa wanawake duniani ni kuchukua tena dini mikononi mwetu.

Kama ulivyo ulimwengu wa kiuchumi na kisiasa, hadithi pia huelezwa kwa kanuni ya nkali: Zinaelezwaje, nani anaelezea, wakati gani zilielezwa, hadithi ngapi zinaelezwa, haya yote yanategemea sana nguvu ya mamlaka.	Like our economic and political worlds, stories too are defined by the principle of nkali: How they are told, who tells them, when they're told, how many stories are told, are really dependent on power.
(Vicheko) ni kazi nzuri, napendekeza kwa wengine	(Laughter) It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.

Hivyo unaweza chukua picha na iPhone na kupata majina yote, japo, tena, mara nyingine inakosea. (Kicheko) Lakini inamaanisha unaweza chukua picha ya baa kama hii, chukua picha, sema, kama huyu mtu hapa, pata jina, na pakua kumbukumbu zote kabla hujasema neno au ongea na mtu maana kila mtu anaishia kua ameandikwa kabisa na michoro ya elektroniki.	So you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names, although, again, sometimes it does make mistakes. (Laughter) But that means you can take a typical bar scene like this, take a picture, say, of this guy right here, get the name, and download all the records before you utter a word or speak to somebody, because everybody turns out to be absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos.

(Kicheko) (Makofi) Tangu hasara yote ilivyonitokea, nimefanya kazi kuongelea kuhusu kifo na hasara, sio yangu tu, kwa sababu ni rahisi kukumbuka, lakini hasara na mikasa ambayo watu wengine wamepitia.

Nikiwa na miaka 17, nilikamatwa kwa wizi na mauaji na punde nikajifunza kuwa fedha jela zinatawala zaidi ya zilivyo mitaani, Hivyo nilitaka kuingia.

Moja ya betri itasimama kabla ya nyenzake.	One of those batteries is going to stop before the other.
na mambo yanapobadilika, na hali kuwa mbaya tunaenda katika mstari mwekundu.	And when things start to change, when conditions start to deteriorate, we move into the red line.

Hapa Uganda, misaada ya maendeleo.	Here in Uganda, development aid.
Niliushuku wosia huu, na miaka minane iliyopita tukawa na uchaguzi nchini Kenya, na matokeo yakapingwa vikali.	I used to question this advice, and eight years ago we had an election in Kenya, and the results were violently disputed.
Kwanza, ni kwa sababu nilikua bila dini kabisa	The first was that I grew up with no religion at all.

Na nilijua kwamba siku moja Ningesaidia kupa kitu, kitu kidogo kwa jumuia yangu.	And I knew that one day, I would contribute something, a little something to my community.
Huyu ni mwanamke, mmoja wa watu wengi wa kawaida waliopo Nigeria, ambao hawakutakiwa kuwa wasomaji.	Here was a woman, part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians, who were not supposed to be readers.
Hebu tufanye hili na tufanye sasa.	Let's do this and do it now.
Karibuni, nilipata kundi la wataalamu wa kupinga ugaidi katika makumbusho mbele ya huu mchoro.	So recently, I had a group of counterterrorism officials at a museum in front of this painting.

(Vicheko) Kama unavyoona,taarifa za kidigitali zitatuonesha kitu fulani lakini zitaanza ,moja kwa moja kwetu kama moja ya mazingira halisi bila kutukatisha sisi kutoka katika dunia yetu.

Ninafikiri kwa namna ya picha.	I am a very visual thinker.
kama sekta yenye sifa dhaidu. Tutazema maafa yake kwa watoto.	Let's just look at the impact on children.
Sasa,ufunguo wa haya yote ni kwamba hatuwezi kukutana na hali hii mara moja.	Now the key to all this is that we cannot only experience this once in a while.
Na ninapoongea na wewe leo. wapo wafungwa na maofisa 63 katika huduma ya jela za Kenya wakisoma sheria katika chuo cha London kwa kupitia kujifunza kwa umbali.

Wangekuwa sahihi kwa nusu yake. Lakini wanafunzi hawapo huko.	They would be right half of the cases. But the students are not there.
Takwimu za hivi karibuni zinaonyesha kuwa muundo wa zamani haufanikiwi. Kuna fursa kubwa ya uwekezaji ambayo mnaweza kufanya. Kama unawekeza kwenye udongo wa lami au mafuta, basi una kibindo ambacho kina raslimali za kaboni.	The latest figures show that the old model is not working. There are a lot of great investments that you can make. If you are investing in tar sands or shale oil, then you have a portfolio that is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets.
Itatubidi kukununua matangazo kama hayo mengi.	We have to buy a lot of those ads.
Kicheko kweli ni utakatifu wenye kaboni.	Laughter really is carbonated holiness.

Inatengenezwa kutokana na vitu viwili Kwa upande mmoja ni mti wa liana ambao ni jamii ya beta-carbolines harmine, harmoline, ambayo ni nishai Kuinywa peke yake ni afadhali uvute moshi mzito wa bluu unaingia kwenye ufahamu wako ambao umechanganywa na majani ya jamii ya kahawa yaitwayo Psychotria viridis.	What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation, but the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources: on the one hand, this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines, harmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic -- to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness -- but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis.

Nimetumia muda mwingi wa kazi yangu kufanyakazi na waandishi wa habari, na waandishi wa blogu, na wanaharakati, na watafiti wa haki za binadamu duniani kote. na nimefikia hitimisho kwamba ikiwa jamii zetu za kidemokrasia hazita simama kidete katika kulinda na kutetea haki za binadamu, uhuru wa vyombo vya habari na mtandao wa intaneti huru na wazi; itikadi zenye siasa kali zinaweza kuendelea kuwepo	I've spent much of my career working with journalists, with bloggers, with activists, with human rights researchers all around the world, and I've come to the conclusion that if our democratic societies do not double down on protecting and defending human rights, freedom of the press and a free and open internet, radical extremist ideologies are much more likely to persist.
kundi hili lina jumla ya miungano mitatu inayowezekana	This group has a total of three possible combinations.

(Kicheko) Kama nikiona kwamba hali inaanza kuwa mbaya, Huwa nawasiliana na mtoa tiba wangu, mwanamke mweusi anayeitwa Dawn Armstrong, ambaye ni mcheshi na mwenye uzoea ambao hunipa faraja.	(Laughter) If I feel like things are starting to spiral, I make an appointment to see my therapist, a dynamic black woman named Dawn Armstrong, who has a great sense of humor and a familiarity that I find comforting.
"Mfano ""Jamaa"" inaelezea hadithi ya mwanamke anayerudishwa nyuma ya muda mara kwa mara kwenye shamba la Maryland la mababu zake."	"For instance, ""Kindred"" tells the story of a woman who is repeatedly pulled back in time to the Maryland plantation of her ancestors."

Elimu ni jambo muhimu linaloleta usalama dhidi ya mfumo wa kuzuia uhalifu.	Education is a critical protective factor against contact with the criminal legal system.
Kwa sababu kumbukumbu halisi sio vitu vyenyewe, Ilikuwa ni utamaduni wa kulifanya jiwe liwe hai.	Because the real memorial was not the objects themselves, it was the cultural ritual of bringing a stone to life.
Lakini baadhi ya vitu pia vinabadilika kimsingi na sisi kama jamii ulimwenguni kote tunakataa tabia zisizokubalika ambazo kwa miaka mingi zimekuwa zikivumiliwa.	I think something's also changing more fundamentally, and we as societies around the world are finally calling out unacceptable behaviors which for too long have been tolerated.
(Makofi) Kuna waleta mabadiliko ambao wanahamishwa sio tu kusaidia walio wanyonge katika jamii, lakini pia kusaidia wafungwa na wengine kupata nafasi katika haki.	(Applause) These are changemakers who are being motivated not only to assist the most indolent in society, but also to help the inmates and others get access to justice.
Iwapo litakuwa linazuiwa wakati wa kutoka, kwa hiyo tungetegemea kuwe na joto kidogo hapa na baridi kidogo pale.	If it's more being trapped on the way out, then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here. Here is the lower atmosphere.

And if we move back again, here, and we put trails on them, like this, you can see again that the speed of development is very, very different, and the countries are moving more or less at the same rate as money and health, but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first.

Hivyo ni nyakati yenye changamoto sana.	So it's a pretty challenging moment.
Na tunapofanya hivyo, mafanikio hayo yatashirikishwa kupitia maabara ya mafunzo na zaidi katika Chuo kikuu cha Edinburgh.	And when we do that, that success will be shared through the learning lab and beyond at Edinburgh University.

Lakini jambo ni hili.	But here's the thing.
Tulijifunza kuwa maelfu ya watu walitaka kutuambia bei zao.	We learned that thousands of people wanted to tell us their prices.
