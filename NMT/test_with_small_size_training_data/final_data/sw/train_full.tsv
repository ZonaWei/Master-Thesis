Au fikiria kuhusu kila mmoja wetu tunapotembea katika jiji, tumezama katika mawazo yetu, na tumeachana na mazingira.	Or think of every one of us as we are walking around the city, we are absorbed in our thoughts, and we detach from the surroundings.
Kile kinachotokea hapa ni kwamba shighuli katika ubongo uliozalisha msongeo katika nyani huyo ulisambazwa hadi Ujapani na ukafanya roboti kutembea na ukanda ya matembezi haya ukapelekwa hadi Duke, ili nyani huyo aone miguu ya yule roboti ikitembea mbele yake.	What happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the monkey was transmitted to Japan and made this robot walk while footage of this walking was sent back to Duke, so that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her.

Nilikuwa naongea kipindi fulani hapo nyuma katika kikao cha pamoja cha bunge la Marekani	I spoke some time ago to a joint session of Congress, last year.
AG: Jibu la swali hilo ni gumu kwangu kwasababu, kwa upande mwingine, nadhani kwamba ni lazima tuone fahari kwa ukweli kwamba mgombea wa Republican – mgombea wa uhakika-- John McCain, na wagombea wote wa Democratic – wote watatu wana tofauti ya mitazamo ya namna ya kusonga mbele juu ya matatizo ya hali ya hewa. Wote watatu wameahidi kutoa mwongozo, na wote watatu wana mitazamo tofauti kutokana na msimamo wa uongozi wa sasa. Na ninadhani kuwa wote watatu wamewajibika katika kupitisha mipango na mapendekezo. Lakini mazungumzo ya kampeni -- kama yalivyofafanuliwa kwa maswali -- ambayo yalitayarishwa na Umoja wa Wapiga Kura Watunzaji wa Mazingira, mchanganuo wa maswali yote -- na, mathalani, midahalo yote imedhaminiwa na nembo ya Orwellian, “Makaa Safi.” Kuna mtu yeyote ameliona hilo?	"AG: The answer to the question is hard for me because, on the one hand, I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the Republican nominee -- certain nominee -- John McCain, and both of the finalists for the Democratic nomination -- all three have a very different and forward-leaning position on the climate crisis. All three have offered leadership, and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration. And I think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals. But the campaign dialogue that -- as illustrated by the questions -- that was put together by the League of Conservation Voters, by the way, the analysis of all the questions -- and, by the way, the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label, ""Clean Coal."" Has anybody noticed that?"
Ilihitajika.	It was demanded.

(Vicheko) Kila siku, nafanya bidii kuwazidishia wanawake sauti na kuoneysha maisha yao na michango yao katika hatua za kutafuta usalama na kutatua migogoro, na kwa sababu ya kazi zangu, natambua kwamba njia ya pekee kwa kuhakikisha ushirikiano kamili wa wanawake duniani ni kuchukua tena dini mikononi mwetu.

Kama ulivyo ulimwengu wa kiuchumi na kisiasa, hadithi pia huelezwa kwa kanuni ya nkali: Zinaelezwaje, nani anaelezea, wakati gani zilielezwa, hadithi ngapi zinaelezwa, haya yote yanategemea sana nguvu ya mamlaka.	Like our economic and political worlds, stories too are defined by the principle of nkali: How they are told, who tells them, when they're told, how many stories are told, are really dependent on power.
(Vicheko) ni kazi nzuri, napendekeza kwa wengine	(Laughter) It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.

Hivyo unaweza chukua picha na iPhone na kupata majina yote, japo, tena, mara nyingine inakosea. (Kicheko) Lakini inamaanisha unaweza chukua picha ya baa kama hii, chukua picha, sema, kama huyu mtu hapa, pata jina, na pakua kumbukumbu zote kabla hujasema neno au ongea na mtu maana kila mtu anaishia kua ameandikwa kabisa na michoro ya elektroniki.	So you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names, although, again, sometimes it does make mistakes. (Laughter) But that means you can take a typical bar scene like this, take a picture, say, of this guy right here, get the name, and download all the records before you utter a word or speak to somebody, because everybody turns out to be absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos.

(Kicheko) (Makofi) Tangu hasara yote ilivyonitokea, nimefanya kazi kuongelea kuhusu kifo na hasara, sio yangu tu, kwa sababu ni rahisi kukumbuka, lakini hasara na mikasa ambayo watu wengine wamepitia.

Nikiwa na miaka 17, nilikamatwa kwa wizi na mauaji na punde nikajifunza kuwa fedha jela zinatawala zaidi ya zilivyo mitaani, Hivyo nilitaka kuingia.

Moja ya betri itasimama kabla ya nyenzake.	One of those batteries is going to stop before the other.
na mambo yanapobadilika, na hali kuwa mbaya tunaenda katika mstari mwekundu.	And when things start to change, when conditions start to deteriorate, we move into the red line.

Hapa Uganda, misaada ya maendeleo.	Here in Uganda, development aid.
Niliushuku wosia huu, na miaka minane iliyopita tukawa na uchaguzi nchini Kenya, na matokeo yakapingwa vikali.	I used to question this advice, and eight years ago we had an election in Kenya, and the results were violently disputed.
Kwanza, ni kwa sababu nilikua bila dini kabisa	The first was that I grew up with no religion at all.

Na nilijua kwamba siku moja Ningesaidia kupa kitu, kitu kidogo kwa jumuia yangu.	And I knew that one day, I would contribute something, a little something to my community.
Huyu ni mwanamke, mmoja wa watu wengi wa kawaida waliopo Nigeria, ambao hawakutakiwa kuwa wasomaji.	Here was a woman, part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians, who were not supposed to be readers.
Hebu tufanye hili na tufanye sasa.	Let's do this and do it now.
Karibuni, nilipata kundi la wataalamu wa kupinga ugaidi katika makumbusho mbele ya huu mchoro.	So recently, I had a group of counterterrorism officials at a museum in front of this painting.

(Vicheko) Kama unavyoona,taarifa za kidigitali zitatuonesha kitu fulani lakini zitaanza ,moja kwa moja kwetu kama moja ya mazingira halisi bila kutukatisha sisi kutoka katika dunia yetu.

Ninafikiri kwa namna ya picha.	I am a very visual thinker.
kama sekta yenye sifa dhaidu. Tutazema maafa yake kwa watoto.	Let's just look at the impact on children.
Sasa,ufunguo wa haya yote ni kwamba hatuwezi kukutana na hali hii mara moja.	Now the key to all this is that we cannot only experience this once in a while.
Na ninapoongea na wewe leo. wapo wafungwa na maofisa 63 katika huduma ya jela za Kenya wakisoma sheria katika chuo cha London kwa kupitia kujifunza kwa umbali.

Wangekuwa sahihi kwa nusu yake. Lakini wanafunzi hawapo huko.	They would be right half of the cases. But the students are not there.
Takwimu za hivi karibuni zinaonyesha kuwa muundo wa zamani haufanikiwi. Kuna fursa kubwa ya uwekezaji ambayo mnaweza kufanya. Kama unawekeza kwenye udongo wa lami au mafuta, basi una kibindo ambacho kina raslimali za kaboni.	The latest figures show that the old model is not working. There are a lot of great investments that you can make. If you are investing in tar sands or shale oil, then you have a portfolio that is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets.
Itatubidi kukununua matangazo kama hayo mengi.	We have to buy a lot of those ads.
Kicheko kweli ni utakatifu wenye kaboni.	Laughter really is carbonated holiness.

Inatengenezwa kutokana na vitu viwili Kwa upande mmoja ni mti wa liana ambao ni jamii ya beta-carbolines harmine, harmoline, ambayo ni nishai Kuinywa peke yake ni afadhali uvute moshi mzito wa bluu unaingia kwenye ufahamu wako ambao umechanganywa na majani ya jamii ya kahawa yaitwayo Psychotria viridis.	What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation, but the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources: on the one hand, this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines, harmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic -- to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness -- but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis.

Nimetumia muda mwingi wa kazi yangu kufanyakazi na waandishi wa habari, na waandishi wa blogu, na wanaharakati, na watafiti wa haki za binadamu duniani kote. na nimefikia hitimisho kwamba ikiwa jamii zetu za kidemokrasia hazita simama kidete katika kulinda na kutetea haki za binadamu, uhuru wa vyombo vya habari na mtandao wa intaneti huru na wazi; itikadi zenye siasa kali zinaweza kuendelea kuwepo	I've spent much of my career working with journalists, with bloggers, with activists, with human rights researchers all around the world, and I've come to the conclusion that if our democratic societies do not double down on protecting and defending human rights, freedom of the press and a free and open internet, radical extremist ideologies are much more likely to persist.
kundi hili lina jumla ya miungano mitatu inayowezekana	This group has a total of three possible combinations.

(Kicheko) Kama nikiona kwamba hali inaanza kuwa mbaya, Huwa nawasiliana na mtoa tiba wangu, mwanamke mweusi anayeitwa Dawn Armstrong, ambaye ni mcheshi na mwenye uzoea ambao hunipa faraja.	(Laughter) If I feel like things are starting to spiral, I make an appointment to see my therapist, a dynamic black woman named Dawn Armstrong, who has a great sense of humor and a familiarity that I find comforting.
"Mfano ""Jamaa"" inaelezea hadithi ya mwanamke anayerudishwa nyuma ya muda mara kwa mara kwenye shamba la Maryland la mababu zake."	"For instance, ""Kindred"" tells the story of a woman who is repeatedly pulled back in time to the Maryland plantation of her ancestors."

Elimu ni jambo muhimu linaloleta usalama dhidi ya mfumo wa kuzuia uhalifu.	Education is a critical protective factor against contact with the criminal legal system.
Kwa sababu kumbukumbu halisi sio vitu vyenyewe, Ilikuwa ni utamaduni wa kulifanya jiwe liwe hai.	Because the real memorial was not the objects themselves, it was the cultural ritual of bringing a stone to life.
Lakini baadhi ya vitu pia vinabadilika kimsingi na sisi kama jamii ulimwenguni kote tunakataa tabia zisizokubalika ambazo kwa miaka mingi zimekuwa zikivumiliwa.	I think something's also changing more fundamentally, and we as societies around the world are finally calling out unacceptable behaviors which for too long have been tolerated.
(Makofi) Kuna waleta mabadiliko ambao wanahamishwa sio tu kusaidia walio wanyonge katika jamii, lakini pia kusaidia wafungwa na wengine kupata nafasi katika haki.	(Applause) These are changemakers who are being motivated not only to assist the most indolent in society, but also to help the inmates and others get access to justice.
Iwapo litakuwa linazuiwa wakati wa kutoka, kwa hiyo tungetegemea kuwe na joto kidogo hapa na baridi kidogo pale.	If it's more being trapped on the way out, then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here. Here is the lower atmosphere.

And if we move back again, here, and we put trails on them, like this, you can see again that the speed of development is very, very different, and the countries are moving more or less at the same rate as money and health, but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first.

Hivyo ni nyakati yenye changamoto sana.	So it's a pretty challenging moment.
Na tunapofanya hivyo, mafanikio hayo yatashirikishwa kupitia maabara ya mafunzo na zaidi katika Chuo kikuu cha Edinburgh.	And when we do that, that success will be shared through the learning lab and beyond at Edinburgh University.

Lakini jambo ni hili.	But here's the thing.
Tulijifunza kuwa maelfu ya watu walitaka kutuambia bei zao.	We learned that thousands of people wanted to tell us their prices.

It's also a problem because you have to go back to the clinic about every week in order to get more pills, and in sub-Saharan Africa or other places where TB is common, now you're talking about going someplace pretty far, taking tough and slow public transport, maybe the clinic is inefficient.
Halafu, wakati nilipokuwa nakimbia na mbwa wangu asubuhi moja, alinivuta kwenye dampo ambalo nilifikiri kuwa liko hapo kimakosa. Kulikuwa na mizizi na rundo la uchafu na vitu vingine ambavyo sitavitaja hapa,	Then, while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump.
Tulifikiria juu ya jinsi tunaweza kuwapa watoto uzoefu wa kweli zaidi katika taaluma ya kisayansi	We thought about how we could give children the most realistic experience of a scientific career.
Sasa inabidi nivue viatu vyangu au mabuti ili kupanda ndege.	(Laughter) Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane!
Hivyo kama hatuna hizi msaidizi T kiini, badala ya misuli yenye afya, misuli yetu inatengeneza seli za mafuta ndani yake, na kama kuna mafuta kwenye misuli yetu, haina nguvu.	So if we don't have these helper T cells, instead of healthy muscle, our muscle develops fat cells inside of it, and if there's fat in our muscle, it isn't as strong.
Na nikatoa mkono wangu nje, nikitafuta kitu cha kuamini.	And I held out my hand, reaching for something to believe in.
mji wenyewe ulikuwa ni uthibitisho fika kwa mazingira ya kufikia maridhiano na msamaha.	The city itself proved to be a stunningly powerful environment to focus on reconciliation and forgiveness.
na uchafu wenyewe umejaa sumu nyingi ambao unaruka nje ya gari na kusababisha madhara.	And then the garbage itself is full of hazards that often fly back out of the truck and do terrible harm.
Na imeendela kubadilika	And it's sort of evolved.
Nani ni shahidi mzuri wa muhimu?	Who was a good potential witness?
Kwanza, protini lazima ionekane katika kansa zote za kongosho kwa kiasi kikubwa,katika damu katika hatua za mwanzoni.	Essentially, first, the protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers, at high levels in the bloodstream, in the earliest stages, but also only in cancer.
Hiyo ilikuwa ukurasa wa pili:wakati wa mafuta.	So that is the chapter two: the oil era.
Nimesema tuwe na shukrani kwa kila nyakati tunayopewa kwa nafasi, na hata tunapopingwa katika kitu ambacho ni kigumu sana, tunaweza ibuka katika hili na kuitikia nafasi tunayopewa.	I said we can be grateful in every given moment for the opportunity, and even when we are confronted with something that is terribly difficult, we can rise to this occasion and respond to the opportunity that is given to us.
Hii haikua sauti ya minong'ono ya mashetani, ila mwanga uliovuma ulionekana ukipungua hasira yake.	This was not the eerie whispering of demons, but a light tinkling that seemed to ease her anguish.
Nilishukuru.Nilifurahishwa sana.	It made me so happy.
Kitu kimojawapo kuhusu Aspegaz ni kwamba mara kwa mara, hawa watu huwa wana utu wa ndani mtata sana, na mimi ninajifahamu, nina haiba ya kuvutia sana, maoni mazuri, na vitu vingi vinavyoendelea kwenye akili yangu.	One of the things with Asperger's is that oftentimes, these people have a very complex inner life, and I know for myself, I have a very colorful personality, rich ideas, and just a lot going on in my mind.
"Tunachotaka kufanya ni kuviondoa -- chochote kati ya pedi mbili tunataka kukiondoa sababu kinaweza kusababisha kitu kinaitwa ""shoti ya umeme"""	"What we want to do is remove these -- anything between the two pads we want to remove, since it can cause something called ""arcing."""
sikupata matokeo mazuri shule ya sekondari,	I didn't make good grades in high school.
Tunamuona asiye hafifu, masikini, mwanamke asiye na uwezo anayefanya biashara pembezoni mwa barabara -- hapana.	We're seeing not a marginal, underprivileged, vulnerable African woman trader by the side of the road -- no.
Unatumia muda na nani?Katika mada zipi?	Who are you spending time with? On what topics?
Nilichukua mengi kutoka maneno haya ya hekima, na kabla ya kwenda darasani majira ya kipupwe niliandika sheria tatu zangu mwenyewe ambazo nazitumia wakati napangillia masomo mpaka leo.	Now I absorbed a lot from these words of wisdom, and before I went back into the classroom that fall, I wrote down three rules of my own that I bring to my lesson planning still today.
"""Wanafunzi walishiriki kabisa."""	"""The students were totally engaged."""
Kwa hiyo ni makadirio ya juu.	So it's probably an overestimate.
Leo, tunamiminika na teknolojia, upiga picha ulioendelea na jukwaa la omiks -- genomiksi, transkriptomiksi, proteomiksi.	Today, we are awash with technology, advanced imaging and omics platforms -- genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics.
lakini kwa upande mwingine, kuna tatizo.	But on the other hand, something is wrong.
ni vigumu kwa wao kuelewa kuwa ipo siku watakuja kufa.	It's difficult for them to understand that they're going to die.
Ubadilishaji jeni una hatari na hizo zinahitaji kujadiliwa, lakini malaria ipo sasa na inaua watu 1,000 kila siku.	Gene drives have risks, and those need to be discussed, but malaria exists now and kills 1,000 people a day.
Ni vipi tunaweza ishi tukiwa na shukrani?	And how can we live gratefully?
Ndio kinachoniamsha asubuhi na kujisikia tayari kwenda.	It's what makes me wake up in the morning and feel ready to go.
(makofi). Nimetoka mbali kukutana nanyi kama hivi.	(Applause) I have come from so far to meet you like this.
Nyama hii ya mimea na ya chembe inawapa walaji vyote wanavyopenda kuhusu nyama -- ladha, umbile na kadhalika -- lakini bila hitaji ya viuavijasumu na sehemu ya madhara kwa hali ya hewa.	This plant-based and cell-based meat gives consumers everything that they love about meat -- the taste, the texture and so on -- but with no need for antibiotics and with a fraction of the adverse impact on the climate.
Nilijifunza kutokufahamu siku zangu ili kuweza kubaki na heshima.	I learned to stay unaware of periods in order to stay decent.
Mwili hata mmoja hautakiwi ubaki haujapatikana au kutotambuliwa.	Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified.
"Rafiki yangu, Kelly Pierre-Loius, alisema, ""Kuwa ngangari hutuua."""	"A friend, Kelly Pierre-Louis, said, ""Being strong is killing us."""
Ilibadilisha muonekano wa nchi,kama unavyoona na kushuhudia.	It changed the face of this country, as you can see today and witness.
"Wakati huu nilikuwa mwaka wa mwisho wa elimu yangu ya sekondari, miezi michache tu kabla sijaanza mitihani yangu ya mwisho na siku chache kabla ya kufanya mitihani ambayo kwa hapa Kenya tunaiita ""mocks"" ambayo dhumuni lake ni kumpima mwanafunzi ni kwa namna gani amejiandaa na mtihani wa mwisho."	"Here I was in my final year of high school, just a few months from doing my end of high school exams and a few days from doing a set of exams we call here in Kenya ""mocks,"" which are somehow meant to gauge how prepared one is for the final exams."
ulikuwa ni mwezi mzuri sana wa maisha yangu Kwa sababu nilikaa tu nikisoma vitabu na kuangalia filamu	It was the best month of my life, because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies.
Inachomaanisha ni kwamba,kama una malaria katika jamii yako, ukuaji wako wa uchumi unadidimia kwa asilimia 1.3 kila mwaka, mwaka baada ya mwaka,kwa hili gonjwa moja tu.	What it means is, if you have malaria in your society, your economic growth is depressed by 1.3 percent every year, year after year after year, just this one disease alone.
Kwa hiyo nashukuru sana kwa kuniruhusu kuongea nanyi.	So, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak.
Sabato inaweza ikawa takatifu	The Sabbath can be sacred.
Kama unamiliki shirika, tunaweza kukurahisishia.	If you run an organization, we can actually make this easier.
Na wote mara mtagundua nini kitatokea kutoweza kuongea lugha yako mwenyewe.	And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language.
Ndani yake kulikuwa na barua zote alizowahi kupokea kutoka kwa wageni wa nchi za nje, na baadhi zao alikuwa amebandika picha ndogo zisizo na rangi zilizochoka za marafiki zake wapya wa kigeni.	Inside it was every single letter he had ever received from visitors from abroad, and on some of them he had pasted little black-and-white worn snapshots of his new foreign friends.
Sio wewe tu ambae ni jasiri.	It isn't just you who's brave.
Na hapa una mpango unaoeleza vile inavyotumika.	And you have a scheme here that describes how it works.
na jibu ni kila kitu.	And the answer is everything.
Na hiki ndicho kilichotokea: takwimu wakati wa vita zilionyesha kuwa pamoja na vifo vyote,	And this is what happens.
Lakini walididimiza sana changamoto ya kisayansi.	But they greatly underestimated the scientific challenge.
Je, hivi ndivyo inavyokuwa?	Is this what it's like?
"Tulitumia data kusimulia juu ya watu waliokuwa wakiteseka na jinsi gani kuepuka mateso hayo, kuepuka madai ya ""nimekudaka""."	"We used the data to tell stories about people who were suffering and how to avoid that suffering, to avoid that ""gotcha"" bill."
Hufanya hadithi moja kuwa hadithi pekee.	They make one story become the only story.
Tatizo ni utaratibu wao wa kutekeleza sheria haueleweki kabisa na kuna uharibifu mkubwa.	The problem is their enforcement mechanisms are a complete black box, and there is collateral damage.

Ndio, injili ya mashaka inamaanisha kua inawezekana kua sisi, kwenye jukwaa hili, kwenye chumba hiki, tumekosea.	Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we, on this stage, in this room, are wrong.
Ningewaona waafrika kwa namna ile ambayo mimi, nilipokuwa mtoto, niliiona familia ya Fide	I would see Africans in the same way that I, as a child, had seen Fide's family.
Tunajenga na Devin, ambaye amekosa makazi pamoja na familia yake pale ambapo mama alitakiwa kuchagua kati ya bili za madawa na kodi ya pango.	We build with Devin, who became homeless with his family when his mom had to choose between medical bills or the rent.
"Na barua hii ya upendo, anapoandika, ""Fumba macho yako na usikilize sauti ya maneno."	"And this lovely letter, where he writes, ""Close your eyes and listen to the sounds of the words."
protini hii moja tu.	Just this one protein.
James hatimaye aliweza, miaka michache iliyopita, kwa kuongeza jeni zinazofanya isiwezekane kwa vimelea vya malaria kushindwa kuishi ndani ya mbu.	James managed it, finally, just a few years ago, by adding some genes that make it impossible for the malaria parasite to survive inside the mosquito.
(Vicheko) kwa hiyo nikalifuata bila kutaka kwa kutopigana na mwanaume ambaye mke wake alikuwa anasimama karibu, ambaye alionekana kama anaweza akanishika vizuri	(Laughter) That one I followed by default, by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby, looking like she had a strong grip.
Kwahiyo tupo katika mwanga wa hicho kipimo, kutokupokea hata hatari moja kati ya billioni ambayo kupotea kwa binadamu kutasababisha huu uwezekano mkubwa.	So we surely, in view of those immense stakes, shouldn't accept even a one in a billion risk that human extinction would foreclose this immense potential.
Na wazazi wangu wakigawanya gharama za gari lililoharibika, nilitelekezwa kwenye likizo ya kazi za nyumbani na bila michezo.	With my parents having to split the cost of a totaled vehicle, I was relegated to a summer of household chores and no sports.
(Kicheko) Kwa njia tunayoelekea, tunaenda kuhitaji kuzalisha asilimia 70 hadi 100 zaidi ya nyama ifikapo 2050.	(Laughter) On our current trajectory, we're going to need to be producing 70 to 100 percent more meat by 2050.
Hakika, Afrika ni bara ambalo limejaa majanga: Kuna majanga yaliyo makubwa, kama ubakaji wa kutisha nchini Congo na wa kudidimiza, kama ukweli kwamba watu 5000 wanaomba nafasi moja ya kazi nchini Nigeria.

Namba sita (Vicheko) Kuandika.	Number six -- (Laughter) writing.
Na mwanahistoria wa jeshi alinifundisha katika kipindi kile kuwa migongano ya kijeshi inawekwa katika makundi matatu: mapigano ya ndani, mapigano ya kanda na machache lakini muhimu ya ulimwengu, vita vya dunia. Migongano ya kimkakati.

Taarifa zetu ni za ovyoovyo kwa ndani, na kwahiyo haziwezi kupangiliwa zitafutike kama nyingine zinavyoweza kutafutwa.	Our information is so peculiar in detail, so that cannot be searched as others can be searched.
Ni huyo mtu, sio paka	It's the guy, not the cat.
wezesha uwekezeji binafsi Afrika,uwekezaji kutoka ndani na nje	Support private investment in Africa, both domestic and foreign.
Unaweza kupata zinazoendana, lakini miungano yote ikishindikana tena, utajua kuwa seti hii haina zaidi ya betri moja nzima.	You might get a match, but if every combination fails again, you’ll know this set can have no more than one good battery.
Na tunafahamu watu ambao ni fukara sana, ufukara ambao sisi hatutaki kuwa nao, lakini wamejawa na furaha mno.	And we all know people who have lots of misfortune, misfortune that we ourselves would not want to have, and they are deeply happy.

Tuna ugonjwa.Kisayansi umefumbika, una changamoto ya kiuchumi, na ndiyo watu ambao wanaosimama kufaidika wanaujali kwa hali ya chini sana.	We've got a disease. It's scientifically complicated, it's economically challenging to deal with, and it's one for which the people who stand to benefit the most care about it the least.
Watengenezaji wanatafuta malighafi za kutengeneza vifaa wanavyotaka kutengeneza.	Makers are searching for materials, parts, components, tools, blueprints to make what it is they want to make.

Hawajui jinsi na wakati wa kuwekeza.	They don't know whether and how to invest.
Lakini wanasayansi wanatakiwa wawe makini kuhusu majaribio yanayotengeneza hali bila uhakiki kwenye dunia ya halisi.	But scientists should surely be precautionary about experiments that generate conditions without precedent in the natural world.
Timu yangu kimsingi ilivunja miaka 30 ya aina hii ya tafiti kwenye jaribio moja la kusisimua, liliyofanywa zaidi ya miezi mitatu tu.	My team essentially collapsed 30 years of this type of research into one exciting experiment, conducted over just three months.
Kati ya hapo kuna mlolongo wa picha -- naam hapa.	Somewhere in here there is actually a series of photographs -- here we go.
Sasa, ninaona miujiza kama hii kila siku.	Well, I see such miracles every single day.
Huu ndio ukweli halisi wanapokuwa chini ya maji wakiangalia mimea na wanyama.	This is the virtual reality when they're underwater observing the flora and fauna.
Watu wote hawa wanatufundisha kwamba kuna namna nyingine za kuwa, namna tofauti za kufikiria namna mbalimbali za kujiwekeza katika Dunia.	All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being, other ways of thinking, other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth.
Uzoefu wa maisha wa mapema uliweka jukwaa kwa mimi kufaa sana kushusha hadhi za wengine, kuwa na tabia inayojitenga kijamii, na zaidi ya yote, kutafuta kuonekana kwenye sehemu ya nguvu.	Early life experiences had set the stage for me to be well-suited to objectify others, act in a socially detached manner, and above all else, seek to be viewed as in a position of power.
jalala la Agbogbloshie ni maarufu kwa sababu pamekuwa ni ishara ya athari ya teknolojia: tatizo litokanalo na mpango wa utupaji wa vifaa vilivyokwisha muda wa matumizi.	Agbogbloshie's scrapyard is famous because it has become a symbol of the downside of technology: the problem of planned obsolescence.
Lakini wakati huohuo,nilitokea katika familia ya Jain, na dini ya jaini inaunga mkono sana aina ya kutofanya fujo.	But at the same time, I come from a Jain family, and Jainism is a religion that espouses a very extreme form of nonviolence.

Kiasi cha fedha ambacho mradi wa END unahitaji kitakwenda moja kwa moja katika utoaji wa matibabu ya minyoo kwa jamii ambazo zina uhitaji na kiasi kingine kitaenda katika uwezeshaji wa miradi kwa umilikishaji wa jamii.	Part of the money the END Fund needs will go directly toward delivering deworming treatments to communities that need it and part will go towards facilitating the handover of programs to local ownership.
kila moja imeundwa kama serikali kuu watawala, baraza la mawaziri, bunge na kazi nyingine nyingi kwa washirika wa kisiasa	Each local government is organized like the central government -- a bureaucracy, a cabinet, a parliament, and so many jobs for the political hangers-on.

Antiquated zoning na sheria za matumizi ya ardhi bado zinatumika mpaka leo kuendelea kuweka sehemu za uchafuzi wa mazingira katika maeneo yangu.	Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood.
Hapa ni Lafayette Avenue - na kama ilivyosanifiwa na wasanifu majengo wa Matthews-Nielsen.	This is Lafayette Avenue -- and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.

Nchini Ethiopia, kwa mfano, hii inafanyika kwa watoto milioni 20 ndani ya wiki chache tu.	In Ethiopia, for example, this is done for 20 million children in a matter of weeks.
Sasa, binafsi nimeona mnara wa Washington mara elfu moja, ninatambua vizuri badiliko la rangi ya marumaru kwa theluthi kwenda juu, lakini sijawahi angalia katika nje ya muktadha katika uhalisia wa kazi ya sanaa.	Now, I've seen the Washington Monument in person thousands of times, well aware of the change in the color of marble a third of the way up, but I had never really looked at it out of context or truly as a work of art.
(Makofi). Kitu cha pili ninachotaka kuzungumzia ni nia ya mageuzi.	(Applause) The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform.
Ingekuwaje kama wote tungejua gharama za huduma za afya mapema?	What if we all knew what stuff cost in health care in advance?
Taratibu, na kwa maumivu, nikaja kutambua kua nilikua mhukumu kama tu wale waliokua wakinitumia barua za chuki kama zilivyokua kwangu.	Gradually, and painfully, I came to realize that I had been just as judgmental of those who had sent me hate mails as they had been of me.
Nilichotakiwa kufanya ni kuepuka kuchukua alama ya mnyama, kupigana na mapepo, mapigo na mpinga Kristo mwenyewe.	All I had to do was avoid taking the mark of the beast, fight off demons, plagues and the Antichrist himself.

So I took a pilgrimage to yet another mecca, Harvard Business School -- (Laughter) this time, knowing that I could not simply accept the salvation that it claimed to offer.
Na hili ndilo ninalojua kwa sasa: Afrika ni muhimu.	And this is what I know so far: Africa is important.
Tumejaa kwenye chumba kama tu hiki, Ila kina viti vya mbao vitoavyo sauti vilivyo- pambwa na kitambaa chekundu kilichochoka na kinanda kushoto kwangu na kwaya nyuma yangu na dimbwi la ubatizo lililojengewa ukutani nyuma yao.

tukatoka katika hiyo barabara, tukaanza kutafua -- tukapata mgahawa wa Shoney.	We got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant.
Tumekuwa miungu sasa?	Are we gods now?
Lakini sisi hatuko TED, mara nyingi tunaambiwa kuwa ajenda ya sera ya maendeleo halisi si jambo linalowezekana, hasa katika miji mikubwa kama New York.	However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large urban areas like New York City.
Disemba iliyopita, wanawake wenye majina ya Isis, ambalo pia ni jina la Mungu wa kike Misri akaunti zao zilizimwa	Last December, a number of women named Isis, which also happens to be the name of an Egyptian goddess, had their accounts deactivated.

Tuna fursa katika madini. Tuna madini mengi ambako hakuna mtu amewekeza katika utafutaji. Tumegundua kuwa bila kuwa na sera sahihi za kuwezesha, hilo halitawezekana. Sasa tuna sheria ya uchimbaji madini ambayo inalinganishwa na sheria nyingine bora duniani.	We have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized that without the proper legislation to make that possible, that wouldn't happen.

Hio inahitajika.	That is needed.
Na unaweza kuona muda wa watu kuishi ulikuwa mfupi.	And you can see that life expectancy was also short.

They have become fonts of communal narrative, symbols of continuity, and I'm pretty sure that many of those European philosophers who questioned an African intellectual tradition must have, beneath their prejudices, been aware of the contribution of Africa's intellectuals to Western learning.
Katika juhudi za kutengeneza utamaduni katika darasa langu ambapo wanafunzi hujisikia salama kusema yale yaliyo ndani ya mioyo yao katika ukimya wao Nina kanuni nne kuu nilizozibandika ukutani mbele ya darasa langu, ambapo kila mwanafunzi hutia saini mwanzo wa mwaka. kusoma kwa makini,kuandika kwa utambuzi, kuongea kwa ufasaha,kusema ukweli.	In an effort to create a culture within my classroom where students feel safe sharing the intimacies of their own silences, I have four core principles posted on the board that sits in the front of my class, which every student signs at the beginning of the year: read critically, write consciously, speak clearly, tell your truth.

Ambao unaendelea kutufanya tuwe salama, mbali na uchafu wetu wenyewe na hali lazima iendelezwe kila wakati bila kujali chochote.	The flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves, from our own dross, our cast-offs, and that flow must be maintained always no matter what.

Ukifikiria kuhusu tatizo la mafua ya ndege miaka kadhaa iliopita, wagonjwa walivyoongezeka, watu walioambukizwa waliongezeka, na kadri kirusi kilivyosambaa kabla mamlaka hayajaweza kumudu kuweza kudhibiti matukio.

Hata ajira zilizoundwa zilikuwa ni ajira zenye tija ndogo sana, hivyo tulihamisha watu kutoka kilimo duni kisicho na tija kwenda biashara zisizo na tija na kufanyia kazi sekta isiyo rasmi katika maeneo ya mijini.	Even those jobs we created were low-productivity jobs, so we moved people from low-productivity agriculture to low-productivity commerce and working in the informal sector in the urban areas.

In the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti, infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength and Tonton Macoutes, and securing the poison used to make zombies.
Bado naendelea kuvunja ukimya leo.	I'm still breaking the silence today.
