Au fikiria kuhusu kila mmoja wetu tunapotembea katika jiji, tumezama katika mawazo yetu, na tumeachana na mazingira.	Or think of every one of us as we are walking around the city, we are absorbed in our thoughts, and we detach from the surroundings.
Kile kinachotokea hapa ni kwamba shighuli katika ubongo uliozalisha msongeo katika nyani huyo ulisambazwa hadi Ujapani na ukafanya roboti kutembea na ukanda ya matembezi haya ukapelekwa hadi Duke, ili nyani huyo aone miguu ya yule roboti ikitembea mbele yake.	What happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the monkey was transmitted to Japan and made this robot walk while footage of this walking was sent back to Duke, so that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her.

Ambapo ndiyo kipindi ambacho daktari mwanajeshi wa Kiingereza Ronald Ross aligundua kwamba alikuwa ni mbu ambaye anaambukiza malaria, sio hewa chafu au anga chafu ,kama ilivyokuwa ikifikiriwa mwanzoni.	That's when the British army surgeon Ronald Ross discovered that it was mosquitos that carried malaria, not bad air or miasmas, as was previously thought.

Na pale tutapoweza kuelezea hizi namna mbili, tunakuwa tumepata ninaoita mche wa utambuzi, ambao ni kama kadi ya utambuzi wa sauti ya gari.	And once we have defined these two aspects, we have what I call the identity prism, which is something like the sonic identity card of a car.

Nilikuwa naongea kipindi fulani hapo nyuma katika kikao cha pamoja cha bunge la Marekani	I spoke some time ago to a joint session of Congress, last year.
AG: Jibu la swali hilo ni gumu kwangu kwasababu, kwa upande mwingine, nadhani kwamba ni lazima tuone fahari kwa ukweli kwamba mgombea wa Republican – mgombea wa uhakika-- John McCain, na wagombea wote wa Democratic – wote watatu wana tofauti ya mitazamo ya namna ya kusonga mbele juu ya matatizo ya hali ya hewa. Wote watatu wameahidi kutoa mwongozo, na wote watatu wana mitazamo tofauti kutokana na msimamo wa uongozi wa sasa. Na ninadhani kuwa wote watatu wamewajibika katika kupitisha mipango na mapendekezo. Lakini mazungumzo ya kampeni -- kama yalivyofafanuliwa kwa maswali -- ambayo yalitayarishwa na Umoja wa Wapiga Kura Watunzaji wa Mazingira, mchanganuo wa maswali yote -- na, mathalani, midahalo yote imedhaminiwa na nembo ya Orwellian, “Makaa Safi.” Kuna mtu yeyote ameliona hilo?	"AG: The answer to the question is hard for me because, on the one hand, I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the Republican nominee -- certain nominee -- John McCain, and both of the finalists for the Democratic nomination -- all three have a very different and forward-leaning position on the climate crisis. All three have offered leadership, and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration. And I think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals. But the campaign dialogue that -- as illustrated by the questions -- that was put together by the League of Conservation Voters, by the way, the analysis of all the questions -- and, by the way, the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label, ""Clean Coal."" Has anybody noticed that?"
Ilihitajika.	It was demanded.
Nchini Marekani, makampuni yalipoteza dola bilioni 351 katika mauzo kwa mwaka 2017 pekee.	In the US, companies lost $351 billion in sales in 2017 alone.

(Vicheko) Kila siku, nafanya bidii kuwazidishia wanawake sauti na kuoneysha maisha yao na michango yao katika hatua za kutafuta usalama na kutatua migogoro, na kwa sababu ya kazi zangu, natambua kwamba njia ya pekee kwa kuhakikisha ushirikiano kamili wa wanawake duniani ni kuchukua tena dini mikononi mwetu.	(Laughter) Every day, I work to amplify the voices of women and to highlight their experiences and their participation in peace processes and conflict resolution, and because of my work, I recognize that the only way to ensure the full participation of women globally is by reclaiming religion.

Kama ulivyo ulimwengu wa kiuchumi na kisiasa, hadithi pia huelezwa kwa kanuni ya nkali: Zinaelezwaje, nani anaelezea, wakati gani zilielezwa, hadithi ngapi zinaelezwa, haya yote yanategemea sana nguvu ya mamlaka.	Like our economic and political worlds, stories too are defined by the principle of nkali: How they are told, who tells them, when they're told, how many stories are told, are really dependent on power.
(Vicheko) ni kazi nzuri, napendekeza kwa wengine	(Laughter) It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.

Hivyo unaweza chukua picha na iPhone na kupata majina yote, japo, tena, mara nyingine inakosea. (Kicheko) Lakini inamaanisha unaweza chukua picha ya baa kama hii, chukua picha, sema, kama huyu mtu hapa, pata jina, na pakua kumbukumbu zote kabla hujasema neno au ongea na mtu maana kila mtu anaishia kua ameandikwa kabisa na michoro ya elektroniki.	So you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names, although, again, sometimes it does make mistakes. (Laughter) But that means you can take a typical bar scene like this, take a picture, say, of this guy right here, get the name, and download all the records before you utter a word or speak to somebody, because everybody turns out to be absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos.

The problem is, that all of this propaganda, monitoring and censorship completely fails to make up for the fact that the people who are the most credible voices, who can present credible ideas and alternative solutions to real economic, social and political problems in their community that are causing people to turn to extremism in the first place, are being silenced by their own governments.

(Kicheko) (Makofi) Tangu hasara yote ilivyonitokea, nimefanya kazi kuongelea kuhusu kifo na hasara, sio yangu tu, kwa sababu ni rahisi kukumbuka, lakini hasara na mikasa ambayo watu wengine wamepitia.	(Laughter) (Applause) So, since all of this loss happened, I've made it a career to talk about death and loss, not just my own, because it's pretty easy to recap, but the losses and tragedies that other people have experienced.
