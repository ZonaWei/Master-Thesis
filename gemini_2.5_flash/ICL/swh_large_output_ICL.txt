While one experimental vaccine appears to reduce deaths from Ebola, so far, no drugs have been definitively shown to be effective in treating existing infections.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but official studies showed it had less benefit than hoped for in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, Zmapp was used as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics accepts the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the Olympic family's primary need to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, might be better served by moving forward with meaningful changes within our organization, instead of decertification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that will perhaps clarify how abuse of the scale so bravely described by Larry Nassar's survivors could have gone undetected for so long, and it embraces important and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and USOC share one goal — to make gymnastics, and other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and enabling environment.
Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as his advisor and also for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
During the 1976 election, he advised Carter on foreign policy, then served as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, and took over from Henry Kissinger.
As NSA, he assisted Carter in handling global issues diplomatically, such as the Camp David Accords, 1978; normalizing US relations with China in the late 1970s; the Iranian Revolution, which led to the Iran hostage crisis, 1979; and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, 1979.

Turkey was taking custody of captured ISIS fighters who, the announcement said, European countries refused to take back.
This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say this animal's fur was reddish-brown on the upper side and pale or carotenoid-colored on the underside.
That discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but they do have other feather characteristics — barbs and barbules — researchers discovered that the rachis is perhaps a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flight but were used for thermoregulation or display. Researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not the soft downy feathers of a chick.
Researchers suggested that, even if this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample shows mature feathers and not juvenile feathers.
A car bomb that exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.
The Governor's office said nineteen of those injured were police officers.
Police said they suspect alleged Daesh (ISIL) militants of involvement in the attack.
They found that the Sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: the activities of all stars in the system were found to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the star's Rossby number, which is related to convective flow.
As the Rossby number decreases, the stars become less active in terms of magnetic variations.

The work done was primarily theoretical, but a program was developed to simulate the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts its pull on the earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way empower the fluid of the Sagittarius sign.
Scientists were able to conclude that a black hole affects another black hole in the same normal way.
This theory states that much of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is in a halo around the galaxy, and is made up of many small particles.
Television reports show white smoke coming from the plant.
Local authorities warn residents near the plant to stay indoors, turn off air conditioners, and not drink tap water.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "very disturbing and terrifying because of the high death rate."
Some patients may have contracted the bug in the hospital, as Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital staff.
In one year, an infected person may infect 10-15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB among the entire TB population still appears to be low, with 6,000 people out of 330,000 infected at any given time in South Africa.

Infrared images show that the temperature difference between night and day indicates that they are likely caves.
It is colder than nearby areas in the daytime and warmer at night.
"Their thermal characteristics are not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly consistent temperature, but they are consistent with them being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Science Center and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been an unimproved technological experience: voters retreat to a booth, then place a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the polling list.
French election law instead stipulates that matter in the code. Strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are added except for those of counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were rescuing the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of killing his son.
He is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any eyewitness testimony might be severely compromised because his picture has been widely published in many places.
This is custom elsewhere in Britain but Scottish law works differently and the courts have viewed the publication of the photos as prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says "journalists appear to put themselves at risk by publishing photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which oversees prosecutions, has indicated to reporters that no further comments will be issued at least until the charges are brought.
The document, according to rumors, will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly dealt with include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands the continuation of military presence in that valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to remove that presence for only five years.
The individuals targeted in the additional attempt to control disturbances were to be supervised by guards, as the attempt would be monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In cooperation with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were enlisted under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four designated sharpshooters for the first shooting operation received full training and safety instructions.
Martelly swore in the new provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly’s response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The protests, which at times turn violent, were triggered by the absence of elections, one of which has been postponed since 2011.
Approximately 60 incidents of defective iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burn injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them about 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company said "were not significant."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said that no damage was reported in the nation.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 gun at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of the old woman because she needed to relieve herself. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and joined the medical profession.
She learned to be a midwife and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that if the hormone were used, it would accelerate the growth of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found the 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
His fellow boxers also mourned Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the full moon. Just as unique as she was. A strong woman.”
Justin “Goldust” Runnels has commented that “Luna was as fragile as me … maybe even more … love her and you will miss her… hopefully she is in a good place.”
Of 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this opinion, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
In the overall vote, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his health has been in doubt.
He could not take the necessary drugs to relieve his pain because they are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were the source of transporting water to Earth, along with carbon-containing substances that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumour as "political ranting and foolishness."
He considered running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration claims would allow planes to use shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to traditional ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is provided, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and park-and-ride facilities are not available there.
Fear of a transport shortage raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the creation of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was believed to take much longer, due to interbreeding between local Darwin's finches, *Geospiza fortes*, and immigrant cactus finches, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be made into different shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled to make sheets.
It can be made thinner, and affixed to other metals. It can be made so thin that sometimes it was used to decorate hand-drawn pictures called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been stripped (since Hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Combine the two dry powders, then, with clean, moist hands, form them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will be touched by the outer layers, which you will feel to be different and will form a type of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a modern toilet in almost every house, connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women mingled together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use satellites.
A satellite in space receives the call then bounces it back down, almost instantly.
A satellite was sent into space using a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of the light and our view.
You don't need a big rocket over 100 feet tall to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to provide us with easy and fast transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transport.
Below it are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat abundant tiny prey, such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a specific job that each cat holds and which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are some of the most social cats, and they live in large groups called prides.
Lion prides are made up of between one and three related adult males, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
Women usually relate very closely to one another, as a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) behaviorally, and are also dangerous to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The leopard is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, tigers, and jaguars of South and Central America. Only these four big cats are able to roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the great roar of a lion, but is more like a scolding sentence with loudly uttered words.
Wild cats like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if they can. Almost all animals that wild cats hunt are smaller than them.
Scientists believe that wild cats track and search for prey by smell, sniffing to locate them on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark and have night vision; they also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the large population they came from (such as when they cross over mountains or a river, or move to a foreign island such that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from where they were originally.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so the new population will require different features or practices to be stronger competitors than what they previously needed.
The original number has never changed, they still need the very same initial methods.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to appear more and more different from the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, those two populations will appear so different that they cannot be called one species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide which humans exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and make our clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was the largest predator of that time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurus.
Its large jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set on the roof of its mouth, meaning that anything it encountered would not escape.
We don't really know, but it's possible he had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may also have been a cannibalistic creature.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a large dinosaur such as T. rex would not stand a chance against it.
While we are familiar with many of their foods, the Romans had their share of surprising or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of mouse called dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their food while seated on chairs, rich people preferred to have feasts together where they would recline on their side while eating their food.
Ancient Roman meals would not have included foods that entered Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of that god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and priests would try to address the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special tower-shaped pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temple.
The upper part was the sacred dwelling of the deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not very important.
Much of the life of the Hebrew family took place outside.
Women cooked in the yard; stores were just open counters facing the street. Stones were used to build roads.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was sold at a very high price.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further West, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, traditions, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've watched the movie National Treasure, you might think the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." This inscription is on the bottom part of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was folded for storage.
Therefore, it is possible that the quote was added as a symbol.
The landing on the day of the attack and the subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied Forces attacked southern France, an attack called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, US and Free French forces had liberated Southern France and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization is a common culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which in a way describes the size of a community.
City-states precede nations. A civilized culture signifies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a cultural footprint that persists over time and equitable distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving important historical evidence and fail to be recognized as a proper civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government – with the US Congress being its only branch – under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce its laws.
It also had no authority to disregard laws and tariff lists between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before being amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian football team, along with the German football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, field hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the Northern regions, where Italians compete in international and Olympic games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), thereby making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the groups of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called, geographically, an 'archipelago'.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when passing English sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, initiating changes in grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many houses along the edges of those complexes were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35 millimetres, which was the main film size in the era of classic cinema.
It is still being produced to this day, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The dimensional ratio of this structure (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is then said to be 3:2.
Many conventional structures (the APS family of structures, for example) are equal to or approximately equal to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates visual power while maintaining a degree of composition in the image.
It says that the place with the greatest impact for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the picture into vertical and diagonal thirds (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which was rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound the states of Europe together despite having different languages and traditions.
Its widespread power affected everyone from the king to the common person.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's financial resources are there specifically for that purpose.
The church's main authority was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this presence of power and money in one place led many to question whether this ideology was being practiced.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy was effective in cutting off essential military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties in the last two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the sea, thus posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was little response to this tactic, Germany expected similar responses for its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of many citizens and nations was one of reconciliation and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and brutality of war during the First World War, nations longed to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in America with only 4 pennies, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of designating different periods of time; each stage of China, or each family that was in power, was a specific dynasty.
Also, between every dynasty there was an unstable period of divided states. Most famous among these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms of Han and Jin.
During these periods fierce battles took place between nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest era in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest throne in the Xi'an palace.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the shift from dictatorship to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution, work was open to all male applicants, thus allowing the ambitious and the successful to prosper.
Likewise for soldiers because instead of military authority depending on class, it now depends on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this ordinary life. He used to frequently visit a cave which came to be known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, provides a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the world.
Indeed, it's never easy to find, even if one knew it existed. Once you enter the cave, you are completely cut off.
Nothing else can be seen but the clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains surrounding it. Very little of this world can be seen or heard inside this cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE is one of the largest buildings constructed in honor of the deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the main pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper bracket" mark looks like a V, and the "lower bracket" mark like a staple or a square missing its lower side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper bow usually produces a quiet sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more stable.
Feel free to pencil in your markings, but remember that the printed slurs are there for musical reasons, and should therefore be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged four), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, filled with fear, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled towards Paris surrounded by a screaming crowd that loudly threatened the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their car windows.
At one point a member of the mob waved the head of a slain royal guard at Versailles before the terrified Queen.
The military expenditures for American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the people of the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Undoubtedly, the great profits from the long-standing oppression of the Filipino people formed the primary revenue of American imperialism.
To understand a templar, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events occurred is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a phrase that encompasses diverse views in practice, ranging from technology push, or technological developments, to the concept that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism incorporate two general views: that technological development itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than being a social construct.
For example, one can say that cars lead to road development.
However, the national road system is only economically viable for a few vehicles, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
Extensive car ownership also leads to numerous road accidents, which results in the development of new techniques in medicine for reconstructing fractured bodies.
Romanticism had a major element of cultural determinations inspired by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Rome, geography shaped people, and over time customs and traditions related to geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the state of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the modern world's fashion capital, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of aristocratic Europe.
It is known for being a center of luxury that began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its situation deteriorated during the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than those offered by Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the transfer of the City of Fashion from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Originally, clothing was influenced by Byzantine cultures from the east.
However, because of poor communication channels, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own styles. One of the biggest developments of that time, as a result of the crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is practiced for the production of just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, often organic, using saved and indigenous seeds for the specific area, along with crop rotation or other simple alternative methods to improve yields.
Historically, many farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together like-minded people who feel alienated by societal norms and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, region, and/or gender of their members.
Characteristics that make a subculture unique might be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signify their membership through unique styles that include fashion, behavior, and language.
One of the popular methods used to demonstrate the importance of interaction is to use a few sad examples of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not interacted with by adults as they were growing up.
Such children are called "cruel" or violent. Other children considered cruel have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in other cases, this abandonment of children was due to parents rejecting a significant mental or physical deficiency in the child.
Perhaps children who lacked touch experienced severe abuse or trauma in their childhood before being released or escaping.
Others are claimed to be drunk with animals; others are said to live in the wild by themselves.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) almost exactly like that of the specific animal caregiver, such as its fear or aversion towards humans.
While project-based learning should make education easier and more interesting, tinkering goes a step further.
Training methods are not a way of studying but a service that provides support to people who are going through a new learning situation, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Platforms can be abstract and also concrete; in other words, a teacher is a type of platform but so is that little paper person in Microsoft Office.
Virtual platforms are incorporated into the program with the aim of questioning, persuading, and explaining procedures that might have been a great challenge for a student to address alone.
Children are placed in Foster Care for many other reasons which range from abandonment to abuse and even abduction.
No child should grow up in an environment that does not educate, does not care, does not teach, but they do.
We assume the Foster Care System to be a safe zone for these children.
Children's homes should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a strong education, and a reliable healthcare system.
Children's homes should provide all these needs that were lacking in the homes from which they were originally taken.
The network combines elements of group and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to further measurements concerning usage and satisfactory methods.
For example, "learning" and "collaboration" are suggested as important drivers for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal participation and "ongoing relationships" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational factors when they investigated audience response on websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of subtle cues, and facial movements that last only a few seconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by accurately interpreting subtle signs.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, showed how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess truth.
He even suggests that such an ability to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals like domesticated dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutations increase phenotypic variation, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Changes in the sampling of segregation and remixing back and forth between those two pools in each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for large animals with a monogastric digestive system to satisfy their amino acid requirements from the available plant matter.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
Easily accessible plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for higher mammals like us to digest unless they are cooked.
Comparatively, animal foods (termites, ants, eggs) are not only easily digested, but also provide high-quality proteins which contain essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that savanna baboons do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep and falling asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done by using an alarm clock that is not too loud to make you conscious without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, to force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biofeedback options involve excessive drinking (especially of water or tea, a common remedy) before sleeping, a situation that forces a person to wake up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that one possesses is inversely related to the level of stress within their body and soul.
The less the pull, the more positive the existing life forces are. Everyone has the ability to find more peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve understanding. One thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, repetition of words or sounds, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan thought is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of transformation is awakened.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, thus leading to the cooperation of the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to the separation of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies turned into enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would truly be fought by proxy forces, in theaters of war from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defenses were broken, and the only hope was to return and reorganize via the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and established Belarusian and Ukrainian borders after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Using ships to transport goods in large quantities was the best way to transport masses of people and many goods by sea.
The Navy's work has traditionally been to ensure your country's ability to transport its people and goods, while at the same time, preventing your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most famous recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
Meanwhile, German forces, using submarines, were trying to stop this traffic.
If the Union had failed, perhaps Germany could have defeated Britain just as it had defeated Europe.
It is thought that goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
In general, domestic goats began to be herded in wandering groups in the mountains or other grazing areas, overseen by guardians who were often children or young people, much like the well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still in use today.
Horse-drawn carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks were lined with parallel logs, they allowed horses to pull them faster and to haul relatively large loads on the poor roads of the day.
Sleepers were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place. However, as time went on, it was discovered that the rails would work better if a piece of metal were laid on top.
This became a custom, but the iron caused the deterioration of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by metal wheels. In 1767, the first full metal rails were introduced.
The first known form of transport was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago, after the emergence of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not normally walk upright.
Bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two feet approximately seven million years ago.
We can start living as good friends of the environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can even become activists to reduce future stress to some extent.
This is equivalent to treating symptoms in most cases. However, if we do not only want a short-term solution, then we ought to get to the root of the problems, and eliminate them.
It is very clear that the world has changed greatly because of human development in science and technology, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and wasteful human lifestyles.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks to John Dunlap's print shop.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, which are now known as the "Dunlop Leaflets."
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy does not exist.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive even now. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on processing information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits, in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that poison.
The term 'mdudu' is formally applied by entomologists to this group of insects.
This word comes from an old acquaintance with bedbugs, which are very skilled at parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are known to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Across America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young adults and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple might decide it is not in their best interests, or the best interests of their child, to raise the child.
This couple can choose to make a custody plan for their child.
When adopting, birth parents terminate their parental rights so that other parents can raise the child.
The main goal of Science is to determine the scientific methods by which the world operates. Indeed, this method guides many scientific studies.
However, it is not alone; experiments – and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or two possible theories – asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on traditional texts, and particularly, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science were accepted, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific origins.
Many followed a pattern in physiology and behavior that often depends on the presence of innate periods and their production through biological rhythms.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just a response to frequent external signals, have been recorded in many living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals,
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will maintain an autonomous rhythm even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the propositions that DNA was the hereditary material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments to label DNA in viruses with radioactive phosphorus or viral protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only germline mutations can be passed on to children, while other changes can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, plants, and animals.
Examples of activities in the area include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks and reading information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the great apes in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in cars heading to work, passing others who are heading to work in the opposite direction.
In this robust mode of transport, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a car-dependent transport system.
Science now indicates that this large carbon economy has removed the world's biosphere from one of its stable states which was supposed to sustain human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems attract such complaints, why do they fail every day? Is it that transport engineers are incapable? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to have certain consistent habits; therefore, traffic jams tend to exhibit some stability and can be represented precisely statistically.
To properly represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three main states: (1) flow, (2) density, (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of intelligent road systems.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly helped them easily evade enemies and find food and their mates with ease.
Many insects are fortunate enough to be able to fold their wings against their bodies.
This gives them ample small places to hide from their enemy.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, because the Earth does not seem as if it is moving, or does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest in the world. It carries over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the sea comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical quality of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the towers of their predecessors, which were at that time over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and and official communications.
Italian is also an everyday language used by many of those working in the government, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of these can be found in nature in their natural state and are easy to extract using primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, proposed the concept that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was like four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new things to create what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like Calcium and Potassium are considered metals. In fact, there are other metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the world is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small such that many trillions can fit at the period at the end of this sentence.
So that pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Sadly, as new writing methods emerge, the pencil is demoted in status and its use diminishes.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, never needing to use a sharpener.
One might wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new comes.
This fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required in the formation of heavy nuclei.
Just like rolling a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the atom once again and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to split apart even with a slight touch.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is known as the crust.
The Earth's surface has an approximate width of 70 kilometers up close and 100 kilometers from a distance.
Under the maria it is thin but thick under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories aim to discover what motivates people to continue or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are deeply rooted as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they do, and what aspects of their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two prominent content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. On the one hand, they will try to identify themselves as ''one of the guys'' (or women).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, delegating responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one changes into an unrecognizable person who feels that they must change everything the team has been doing and make it their own.
After all, it is the leader who is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
That behavior often causes divisions between leaders and the entire team.
Standard teams are held to the same quality standards as other standard teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their current physical group.
Often they have more freedom than regular team members because their teams can meet according to varying time zones and it can be misunderstood by their management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is a unique characteristic of virtual teams.
The invisible team is a management team where every member reports. The invisible team sets standards for every member.
Why should an organization go through a lengthy process to establish a learning organization? One goal of putting the concepts of a learning organization into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the effective departments of an organization, creativity and expertise can emerge.
As a result, the organizational process of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process for serving customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Chain Method as a means used to help organizations achieve high performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical perspective on cognitive studies. Thus, it narrows the field of study and makes it more specific.
The existing similarity between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some cognitive functions.
The emergence of new technologies enables us to see and examine brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and resources to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is heavily associated with science fiction, it forms a very important part of the computer science branch, addressing the behavior, learning, and adaptation of machine intelligence.
Research in AI involves building working machines that automate intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and coordination, the ability to respond to customer recognition and inquiries, as well as text, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become distinct disciplines, aiming to provide solutions to life's problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, just as it has been built into several home computer programs and video games.
School trips are a big part of any class. Often, the teacher likes to take their students to a place where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers solutions through virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or enjoy fine art while sitting in their classroom.
Participating in a virtual field trip together is also a good way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future travelers.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital; every year that website is revised, but old versions remain online to be used as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also enhance student writing. While students may begin their blogging experience with grammar and spelling issues, the presence of a general audience changes that.
Since students are the most important audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to be knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's curiosity motivates students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to expand their reading beyond the normal school day.
The effective use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical; through actively responding to online resources, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings as well as express their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is an attractive and bilingual Canadian city, boasting a range of art galleries and museums filled with Canada's past and present history.
Further to the south is Niagara Falls and to the north is the heart of Muskoka's unspoiled beauty and beyond.
All these and many more things portray Ontario as inherently Canadian to outsiders.
Vast areas in the far north are sparsely populated, and some are uninhabited wilderness.
In a surprising population comparison: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in itself, when it comes to wildlife.
Many of the small islands are independent states, or are associated with France, and are known as coastal resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the regions, and it greatly influenced Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded by the Sahel to the north, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: it is recommended that any female travelers say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also important to wear a ring (and not one that looks too expensive).
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm in saying no to people, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The current city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
Near the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hooks, and a whole range of geegaws, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which covered much of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is largely safe, any trips outside Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano as well as the easiest ways to track Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual fare for locals is 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Despite its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for very distant foreign lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its fame makes it a tourist attraction, and there is also an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, because it has more of an Arab character than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's attractions and is considered the flagship among South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all National Parks in Southern Africa, there is a daily conservation and entrance fee.
It may be beneficial for one to purchase a Park Card, which offers entry to certain South African parks or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong region its name and is a major focus for many tourists.
The array of buildings that form Hong Kong's skyline takes the form of a pleasing bar chart, and is likely shaped by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To get a better view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Much of the urban development of the Hong Kong Islands is concentrated on reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This is where the English colonists considered it their own, and therefore if you are looking for colonial-era evidence of the area, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangroves of the world's coastal belt, extending 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and the Indian subcontinent.
The Sundarbans has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps – they include some of the largest remaining forests that were once covered by the Gangetic plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, where one-third is covered by water/marshland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife park, and it is now estimated that there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) all day long, although many, especially those heading east and to Jakar / Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is advised to buy tickets several days in advance.
Many districts are served by Japanese Coastal mini-buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby areas, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, have a length of 378 meters and have two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant group inhabiting what is now called Eastern Paraguay, living as nomadic hunters who also cultivated subsistence crops.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally known as the "Giant of the Indies Region," was born following confrontations between the Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial period which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest match of the year will take place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and small matches can also be seen from here at other times of the year.
For information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is estimated to be equal to that of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
Generally, British pounds will be accepted anywhere in the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
In the outer islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency may be taken; check with the owners in advance to find out which payment method is accepted.
It is not possible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when the Northern Hemisphere is cold and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; during the summer months, temperatures above +30ºC are common.
The winter season can be deceptively cold: temperatures very rarely go below freezing point, but the wind and humidity combine to make it colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no specific "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the wild are accustomed to seeing humans, they are wild animals nonetheless, and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park management, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how calm they appear, bison, elk, hartebeest, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not observe a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Additionally, understand that smell attracts bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods and maintain cleanliness at the campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of fewer than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was a site of a famous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British ship. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggles organized by the Mau movement, a peace meeting in town led to the murder of high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's sprawling development around two harbors. The most famous are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and many of them have shade under pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent areas of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches which are sometimes crowded, with a range of shops on the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main beer in the area is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but it's good and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many types of French wine available, but New Zealand and Australian wines can travel better.
Tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of ‘white’ coffee is foreign. A short black is an ‘espresso’, a cappuccino comes with more cream (not foam) and tea is prepared without milk.
The hot chocolate reaches Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips are made to the reef throughout the year, and injuries on the reef due to any cause during these are rare.
Still, take advice from authorities, obey all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Sea caterpillars appear near the coast and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. Sometimes they may be found outside these times.
Sharks are present, although it is rare for them to attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live extensively in the sea, as their primary habitat is river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking early gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to stay upon arrival.
Travel agencies often have special hotel offers, though you may also be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies typically offer package deals that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any amendments or requests must be pursued through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, a large number of music festival attendees decide to camp at the venue, and many of them consider it an important part of that experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to get up early to get a spot to set up camp near the music.
Note that even if the music on the main stage ends, there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music until midnight.
Several festivals have designated camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin area, as passing through the ice causes unpleasant noise for those most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. These passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make great efforts to increase the money and time spent by gamblers. Windows and clocks are usually absent and the exit door is difficult to find.
They often have unique food, drinks, and entertainment offerings, to entertain guests and keep them within their premises.
Some halls offer alcohol inside. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone driving in elevated areas or mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, and extreme cold.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you are on bare asphalt.
During heavy snowfall, enough snow to get you stuck can fall in a short amount of time.
Visibility can also be restricted by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, snowy and icy conditions are common in many countries, and transportation continues year-round without disruption.
Perhaps safaris are the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari means travelling to see amazing African wild animals, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to move closer to cars, and standard equipment will allow for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
Hiking (also known as "bushwalking", "trekking", or simply "walking") involves climbing, whether for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will begin on August 24 until September 5, 2021. Some competitions will take place in various locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have ever hosted two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, many coronavirus cancellation policies did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between Yen 2,500 and Yen 130,000, with standard tickets costing approximately Yen 7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards for rent, even if one is not in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful the cloth isn't too hot (as it can cause scorching, or in the worst case, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are effective against specific threats.
In some places boiling water for one minute is enough, elsewhere a few minutes will be needed.
Filters vary in performance, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a completely sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests which they do not recognize from their home areas.
Pests can damage food, cause annoyance, or in severe cases cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill people, usually do not qualify as pets.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods free of duty and tax in certain areas.
Travelers in countries that charge high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated forested areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp turns are common.
The posted speed limits are much lower than those of the preceding and following sections — usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour) — and strict adherence to them is more important than otherwise.
Surprisingly, however, cellular service is much stronger here than in other remote areas like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bread is excellent, and in Bavaria, it is even better and more diverse, just like that of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with apple pies available year-round, and cherries and plums appearing during the summer season.
Many German baked goods feature almonds and nuts. Popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small, yet superior doughnuts, try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a food made from herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A spice blend can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is widely used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses a wide variety of cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without further adjectives, the word tends to mean food which originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The most common food found across the archipelago is Javanese cuisine, simply prepared, with its basic flavors consisting of peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports that hold the rider's feet, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider great stability but can be a safety concern because of the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck inside them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their leg gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse bolts. To reduce this risk, several safety measures can be taken.
First, many riders wear high-top boots with a soft, very thin sole.
Then, other saddles, especially English saddles, have safety stirrups that allow the stirrup leather to fall away from the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley – a major climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with large and varied granite and rock walls.
Climbs often offer breathtaking views from their summits. Mountain climbers from all over the world continue to establish new routes on its formidable walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain using skis or snowboards strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a major activity, with many participants, often known as "ski bums," planning their entire vacation around skiing in a particular area.
The idea of snowboarding is very old – cave drawings show snowboarders from as far back as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing began at least in the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ice-skating club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski trekking.
It is related to but usually not associated with high-mountain ski tours or mountain ascents, the latter being performed on steep terrain and requiring a board and stiff boots.
Think of a ski slope as an analogous climbing path.
In ideal conditions you will be able to cover a greater distance than walking – but you will very rarely achieve high skiing speeds in the countryside without a heavy pack on previously-used trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but it has many independent countries. Normally, traveling through many countries would mean having to apply for visas and go through passport control frequently.
The Schengen Area, however, functions largely as a single country in this respect.
It's better that you stay in this area; you can cross borders without going through passport control points again.
Also, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member country individually, thus saving time, money, and documents.
There is no general definition of which manufactured goods are antiques. Some customs organizations define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit may be shorter in areas like North America than in Europe.
Art products can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important to many who have other professions.
However, traditionally, not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities, and primarily raised reindeer as work animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the term "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani people.
If the country you will visit is subject to a travel advisory, your health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance might be affected.
You might also want to consult government advice rather than your own, but their advice is tailored for their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may experience different situations from Europeans and Arabs.
An advisory is just a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The views presented are often quick, general, and greatly simplified compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a common term for any dangerous weather condition and has the potential to cause damage, major social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are many types that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, drought, and wildfires are forms and effects of extreme weather conditions, as well as storms, typhoons, waterspouts, and tornadoes.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include heavy snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather hazards affecting their area as it may affect any travel plans.
Anyone who plans to visit a country that is considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search for ‘Hostile environment course’ on the Internet might possibly yield the address of a local company.
Typically, the course will cover all the issues discussed here in depth, and often include hands-on experience.
Normally the course will take 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness life are common, but publications related to war zones are few.
Travelers intending to go abroad for gender reassignment surgery must ensure they carry valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue gender-neutral (X) passports or updated documents to match the intended name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents also varies.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Gays should not expect to pass through scrutiny and emerge from it with their dignity and secrets intact.
Backwash currents are those that return from the breaking of waves as they recede from the shore, often on a rock or a similar place.
Due to the underwater topology, the returning currents tend to concentrate in a few deep areas, and high-speed deep-water waves can form there.
Many deaths occur due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the waves, which can be difficult.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again or, depending on your skill or if you've been seen, you might want to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock comes on faster than culture shock (without the honeymoon period), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who had an easy time adapting to a new culture sometimes have a difficult time readjusting to their original culture.
When returning home after living abroad, you have become accustomed to a new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a foreign country need to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also important for travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most enjoyable things in the children's area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in the stillness before the show begins.
Usually you hear the voices of tourists and sellers. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is placed as a backdrop by the narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramid and different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have many bases, including sixteen that were active in 2020.
The islands are located 120 kilometers north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island, which has the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a unique natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here join this plain, then re-emerge to form the 360-kilometer range of the Ellsworth Mountains, and are divided by the Minnesota Glaciers.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica such as Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson reaching a height of 4892.
In remote areas, without mobile phone signals, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone is not generally a substitute for a mobile phone, as you must be outdoors in the open and have a line of sight to the satellites to make a call.
The service is frequently used for transportation, including luxury vessels, as well as for journeys with remote data and voice requirements.
Your mobile service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular choice for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among school graduates, allowing them to take a year off before entering university, without affecting their studies.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can certainly improve your chances of furthering your higher education in your own country.
Normally there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great place for boating. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
For archipelagos and islands, you don't necessarily need a ship.
Although coastal islands and larger lakes are actually large enough for any boat, small boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is an international sport in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is consistent with Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is completely different (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Many of the Baltic journeys tend to have long stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several days while returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only visit the coast on cruise trips, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin and Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and a trip to this city is not included in the price of the cruises.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or have experienced a distressing event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's not very different from the personal fear and aversion to other things that many people have.
For others, understanding how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear that is based on the unknown or not being in control.
Transportation companies are well-paid for fast delivery. Often, time is of the essence for commercial documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
In some ways, large companies have their own planes, but in other ways and with small companies there were problems.
If they were to send items by air cargo, in some cases it might take several days to complete unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it through quickly was to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations will not allow luggage to be sent without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to travel in first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the opportunity (or, even better, to make your company pay for it).
However, this doesn't come cheap: because of vague and unfavorable rules, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare, business fare, and 11 times for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no need to even look for business discounts or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies know very well that there is a certain segment of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the right to arrive somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they adjust accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a nation with many ethnic groups that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, these conflicts led to the creation and self-declaration of the State of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now modern, developed, and a bustling commercial center, situated around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide streets, buildings with glass facades, and modern commercial centers give way to traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city itself has a more European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík has a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusually shaped octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are impressive marble sculptures of doves on the grave.
It's worth half an hour to walk around that charming village.
To the north and easily accessible is a romantic and charming city, made famous by visitors who recounted its glittering adornments as recorded by Lord Byron.
The Skotabu 403 bus travels frequently to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (Shrine), a world-famous site for Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are specifically visiting a place with a mass grave, and also a place that holds unfathomable meaning for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who spent their time here, and many others whose loved ones were killed or worked to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat that place with all due dignity, order, and respect. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the website by marking or cutting graphics on the designs.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of them prefer to speak Catalan, a large number understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, many signs are displayed in Catalan because it is legally established as the first official language.
Spanish is still widely used in public transport and other places.
Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Italian, but unplanned disruptions are announced by automatic systems using various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-absorbed, rude, and arrogant.
While this is often just a misconception, a good way to get along in Paris is still to be on your best behavior, to act like someone who is “bien élevé” (well-mannered). It will make getting along much easier.
The sudden Parisian exterior will quickly melt if you show some basic respect.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, especially with beeches, firs, and spruces, and a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has diverse plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes.
The area is also home to a great many different species of animals and birds.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and European quail can be found there, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are expected to wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Many monasteries provide sarongs for women who come without one, but if you come with your own sarong, especially one with bright colours, you will get a smile from a monk or sister at the entrance.
Likewise, men are required to wear trousers that cover their knees.
This can also be requested from the store at the gate, but the clothes are not washed after every user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing those skirts. One size fits all for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of other parts of the Mediterranean region, is made with bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and always uses olive oil.
A simple dinner, especially during summer, is usually Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and other available ingredients such as cheese and tuna.
All nouns, including 'Sie' for 'you', always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to differentiate between some verbs and objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easy, although writing is somewhat difficult due to the need to know whether a verb or an adjective is used for its significance.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because many words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
Key letters to note are c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means a horse-drawn carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple, and often regular grammar.
Therefore, studying this grammar resource will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand it better.
Needless to say, if you know the language of love, it will be easy for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people with a little knowledge of Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is very similar and that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern examinations are usually not used today, and remain as museums, or educational sites.
Because light pollution in their time was not a problem as it is today, they are often in cities or universities, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Many modern research telescopes are key facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
That idea came from China where plum blossoms were the preferred flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were organized by the emperor for himself and other participants of the mediation who surrounded the Imperial Court.
Plants look best when in their natural environment, so avoid the temptation to take even "just one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formal garden, collecting "specimens" will also get you removed, without question.
Singapore is generally a very safe and easy place to navigate, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
But being located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to contend with a lot of heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also a few buses heading north of Hebron, the site of the traditional tombs of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are considering boarding goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a beautiful setting for a holiday.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or traveling through scenic areas along the Danube, or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also describe popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
It is a custom to stay up all Easter night in certain open places to see the sun rise.
Indeed there are Christian theological explanations for this custom, but it may also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility worship.
More traditional churches hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with worshippers celebrating at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All native animals that arrived on these islands probably came here by swimming, flying or or floating.
Because of the long distances from the mainland, mammals were unable to complete the journey, with the giant tortoise being the primary herbivore in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic and Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora, as the sky will be somewhat dark both day and night.
Since those areas are not densely populated, and little pollution is usually not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more systematic and formal than Western practices.
Suits are common business attire, and employees call their colleagues by their family names or by their professional titles.
Cohesiveness in the workplace is important, emphasizing group efforts instead of praising individual achievements.
Often employees get approval for any decisions they make from their supervisors, and they are expected to obey the orders of their superiors without question.
