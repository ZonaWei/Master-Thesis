This not only confirms the widespread theory that dinosaurs had feathers, but also details that fossils cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers said the plumage color of this animal is dark brown on top and lighter or orange underneath.
The discovery provides insight into feather evolution in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a developed shaft called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics — barbs and barbules — researchers say that the rachis is an older evolutionary product of these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers is not for flight, but for heat regulation or for display. Researchers said that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample is a collection of adult feathers, not of a bird.
Researchers said that while this was a baby dinosaur tail, the sample was a collection of adult feathers and not chicken feathers.
Two police officers were killed and more than twenty people were injured yesterday in Gaziantep, Turkey, in a car bomb explosion at the police headquarters.

They found that the basic principle by which the sun operates is similar to that by which other stars operate: the movement of all stars in the system is found to be governed by reflection, their rotation, and nothing else.
They used the luminosity and rotation, along with the plasma flow, to determine the star's Rossby number.
The fewer the sunspots, the lower the star's activity in terms of magnetic reversal.

Although the work performed was mostly theoretically supported, the program was written to simulate observations from the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for is caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon has gravitational force on Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way has a gravitational force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that the effect dark matter has on other dark matter is just like normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding the galaxy is found in a halo around it and is made of many small particles.

"Their thermal properties are not static like large caves on Earth that maintain a constant temperature, but this is consistent with them being deep pits underground," said Glenn K. Sching of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Science Center and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters seclude themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the poll book.

Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, allowing voters and observers to confirm that they contain no ballots at the start of the election, and that at its conclusion, no ballots other than those cast by registered and authorized voters have been deposited.
Candidates can send representatives to observe each part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following certain procedures.

Adekoiya has since been charged with her child's murder at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She has been arrested awaiting charges and evidence, but any eyewitness testimony may not be admissible because much has been said about her in the community.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and courts consider publishing photographs as prejudice.
Dundee University Professor Pamela Ferguson said: "Journalists seem to be treading a dangerous line if they publish photos and other information about suspects."
The Akil office, the Public Prosecutor, said it would not comment to journalists until charges are supported by evidence.
The document, according to the leaked information, refers to the border dispute over Palestine's demand for borders based on those prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other covered topics, as reported, include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries and for the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel wants a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed, while the PA, for its part, agrees for such a presence to be for only five years.
In an additional pest control experiment, applicators are closely supervised by supervisors because the experiment is under control and its effectiveness is being evaluated.
Through the Sports Shooters Association's hunting program, qualified volunteers were recruited in partnership with NPWS and the Australian Sport Shooters Association (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first cull received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly has sworn in a new nine-member Transitional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the early dissolution of the CEP as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests stem from the failure to hold elections, some dating back to 2011.
Approximately 60 iPod overheating malfunctions were reported; a total of six fires occurred, causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple Inc. had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which Apple described as "not serious."
The minister responded by calling Apple's report transfer "truly regrettable."
The earthquake hit Marina at 07:19 A.M. local time (Friday 09:19 P.M. GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said no damages have been reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there was no tsunami sign.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as Filipino photographers, were released earlier.
Because she wanted to go to the restroom, the photographers took the old woman's place. Mendoza was killed with a gun.
Ligins followed in his father's footsteps and joined the medical profession.
They received training as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Ligins began to study premature labor in his spare time.
His study shows that if a hormone is given, it accelerates the fetal lung maturity of the baby.
Government investigators found two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
Her fellow activists also expressed their condolences to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the original extreme queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night of two moons. Uniquely beautiful, just like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was very crazy like me... maybe more than me... I love her and she will be missed... we hope she is in a better place."
Before the 2010 federal election, out of 1,400 people surveyed, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34 percent of those polled share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last Queen.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming events has three relays for our team at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his lingering issues, his fitness was in doubt.
Due to being banned from the games, he was unable to take the medicines needed to cope with his illness.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number by January 25.
Many people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software until early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets might be a source of Earth's water supply, along with organic substances capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed.
53-year-old Kumo began his rule earlier this year and signed a law last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the allegations as 'political chaos and foolishness'.
They are expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is the system that the FAA announces will allow aircraft to save millions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon emissions by making shorter trips.
Unlike the former ground-radar-based technology, it uses satellite-based technology to enable air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with high accuracy and to provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional services are being added, overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking will not be available at our park-and-ride facilities.
Fears of transportation shortages increased the likelihood that the game would be forced to take place behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in Science magazine reported the creation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new species was formed in just two generations, a process that had been expected to take much longer, as a result of interbreeding between the rare Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortis) and the large cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be made into all types of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be bent and twisted. It can be hammered into a smooth sheet or rolled.
It is made very thin and attached to another metal. Because it could be made so thin, it was used for decoration on hand-drawn illustrations in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage liquid.
Cabbage juice changes color based on its chemical acidity or alkalinity.
The pH level in the tested chemical is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which their electrons have been removed (therefore, hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron).
Sift the two dry powders together, then with clean wet hands, press them into balls.
The moisture on your hands interacts with the outer layers, creating an odd feeling and forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had flush toilets in every house, connected to an advanced drainage system.
Remains of the sewage system were found in homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mixed.
When you call someone living thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and instantly reflects it back.
The satellite was launched into space by rocket. Because Earth's atmosphere alters some lights and views, researchers use telescopes in space.
To put a satellite or telescope into space, a huge rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel has dramatically changed the world. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is providing very easy and fast transportation.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Under them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized animals, from rabbits to deer.
Finally, there are many small wild cats (including feral domestic cats) that eat a huge number of small animals such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a field, a unique job that prevents each cat from competing with the other.
Lions are very social cats that live in large groups called prides.
Lion prides consist of one to three young males, up to thirty females, and cubs.
The women are often very related to each other; many are families of sisters and daughters.
Jaw afflictions in lions, like those in wolves or dogs, are very dangerous to animals like lions (but not other large cats) and to their prey.
The tiger is a well-rounded athlete, capable of climbing (though not well), swimming, jumping long distances, and dragging five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers are in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (genus Panthera). Only these four cats can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like a lion's full-throated roar, but rather more like guttural growls and snarls.
Ocelots/desert cats like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rats and birds. Almost all the animals that Ocelots/desert cats hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists find that ocelots track prey by sniffing the ground where the animals had been.
They can see well at night, and they can also move well. Ocelots find prey by blending in with their surroundings.
Small populations of living things, when they move away from their original main population (for example, if they cross a mountainous area or a river, or travel to a new island from which they cannot easily return), often find themselves in an environment different from where they were before.
This new environment has various resources and various competitors, therefore, the new species needs various characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than it needed before.
The original species has not changed at all; they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, its similarity with other populations decreases.
In the end, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means creating new species. Creating new species is an inevitable outcome and an essential part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that people emit (i.e., that which is exhaled).
Plants prepare their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants, and we also make clothes from plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing except other Mosasaurus.
Its long jaws were equipped with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and it had an additional set on the roof of its mouth, which meant there was no escape for anything that passed its way.
We don't know for sure, but it might have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might even have eaten its own kind.
It would attack anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex could not be its match.
Although we know most of their food, Romans had strange or unusual feast foods, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of mouse called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women eat food sitting on chairs, the rich, when eating their food, like to hold a big party where they can socialize on the side.
Ancient Roman foods could not include ingredients that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or even cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered a house for the gods.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to discern the will of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary into which only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the building was a special sanctuary for his god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not very necessary.
Most of Hebrew family life was conducted outdoors.
Women cook food in the courtyard; shops were open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, therefore wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, while traveling west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever his discovery was, Eskimo tribes were living there at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film "National Treasure", you might think that a treasure map was written behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Despite what is written on the back of the document, this is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, Dated July 4, 1776" were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, early in its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, the note may have been added only as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France; however, the south was still not liberated.
It was governed by "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were returning to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a society of large populations who live and work cooperatively.
The word civilization comes from "civilis," which means civil, connected to the Latin "civis," which means citizen, and "civitas," which means city or city-state, and this somehow describes the size of the society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. The culture of civilization signifies the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and equitable distribution.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and do not receive recognition as conventional civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially established a weak central government—with Congress as its sole body—under the Articles of Confederation.
The council had no authority to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it often relied on uncooperative state leaders to enforce all its laws.
Also, it did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required collective consent from all regions before their approval, and because the regions did not properly engage with the central government, most of their representatives were absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the German national team, and they were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
While Italians compete in international games and Olympics, winter sports are most known in the northern regions.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is called Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to its collection/group of islands, Japan is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its foundation in southern Taiwan by initiating changes in the agricultural practices of the natives and by employing Chinese day laborers to work in its sugar and rice factories.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, and the island remained under Japanese control until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures called the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings within the compound have been rebuilt to give tourists a better understanding of how they first arrived.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is still 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but its aspect ratio has been superseded by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format was actually somewhat confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest overall numerical ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) have an aspect ratio equal or very close to this.
The much-maligned and often-derided rule of thirds is a simple guide for creating flexibility while maintaining a certain standard in the image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into three (see example).
During this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under investigation.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has united European states despite language and cultural differences. I
The all-destructive power affects everyone, from scholars to common people.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's financial fund is specifically allocated for this reason.
The church's central authority has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this accumulation of power and money has led many to question whether its fundamental guiding belief is being fulfilled.
Soon after the conflict broke out, Britain began to blockade the German navy.
Although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which has been integrated into several international agreements over the past two centuries, the tactic has been effective by cutting off essential military and civilian supplies.
To prevent any British ship from passing through vast bodies of water, she mined international waters, which was a danger even for neutral ships.
Since there was only a limited response to the tactic, Germany expected the same for the unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the dominant sentiment among many citizens and countries was anti-war and isolationism.
During the First World War, after witnessing the horror and cruelty of war, countries wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He entered the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor).
Ancient China had a unique way of showing its various time periods; every Chinese stage, or rather, every family that was in power, had a clearly distinct dynasty.
And so, it was an unstable period of fragmented states divided among various dynasties. During these times, the most well-known was the Era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, a fierce war was fought among many nobles struggling for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a bloody period in ancient Chinese history, as thousands of people fought and died while struggling to sit on the highest throne in the Xian palace.
There are many social and political impacts, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to popular rule, nationalism, and the idea that the country belongs to the people and not a sole ruler.
Also, after the revolution, professions that were highly in demand and enabled them to be successful were open to all male applicants.
The same applies to the military, because their ranking system was now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution inspired working-class people in many other countries who were under pressure to start their own rebellions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this ordinary life. He would often go to the cave known as Hira on Mount Noor (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself, surviving from that era, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave was completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if one knows it exists, it is never easy to find. Once inside the cave, it is total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky surrounding the numerous mountains. From inside the cave, only a very small part of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, is one of several large pyramid structures constructed to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The 'Giza Plateau' or 'Giza Necropolis', located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains many pyramids (including the Great Pyramid, which is the largest), many smaller tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family.
The "upper fold" symbol looks like a V, and the "lower fold" symbol looks like a stapler wire or a square missing its bottom part.
Upwards means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and downwards means you have to start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The up-stroke usually produces a soft sound, but the down-stroke is stronger and more assertive.
You can mark your own score with a pencil, but the printed bowing marks are placed for musical reasons, so they must be observed.
A very distraught King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister Madame Élisabeth were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by an angry mob of market women.
They returned to Paris surrounded by many people making shouts and threats against the King and Queen.
The people gathered for a riot forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows widely.
At one point, a member of the mob was waving the head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles, in front of the startled queen.
United States imperialism paid the cost of the war for the Philippine people.
On behalf of the Philippine government, they agreed to pay overhead costs and bond interest through Wall Street banks to U.S. investors.
Indeed, the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people, among the most profitable enterprises established, yields fundamental benefits for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the religious group.
The period in which the events occurred is known as the High Middle Ages in European history: the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages are preceded by the Early Middle Ages and are followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends in 1500.
Technological determinism is a strong conviction that, in practice, encompasses numerous ideas, tending to believe that human destiny originates from technology-driven forces or technological necessity, which in turn stems from scientific laws and fundamental logic related to the manifestation of technology.
Most definitions of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a largely independent path, beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that a motor vehicle necessarily leads to road development.
But a nationwide road network for small cars is not economically viable, so new manufacturing methods have been established to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Owning many cars also leads to a high incidence of accidents on the road, which necessitates the development of new techniques to repair damaged parts.
Romanticism was a significant part of the cultural commitment derived from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, cultures associated with geography and that suited society's particular location were preferred over arbitrary rules.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was called the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a major luxury center lasted from 400 A.D. until 1100 A.D.
In the twelfth century, the situation declined, primarily as Christian crusaders returned with gifts from the Byzantine market, such as silk and spices, that were valued more than its own offerings.
It was at this time that the title of 'fashion capital' was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, the dress had a significant influence on Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow means of communication, Western lifestyles could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style of dress. Due to the wars, one of the biggest developments of the time was that people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture means when a farmer has produce that can only benefit him and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, often organic, that uses heirloom seeds native to the ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel excluded by social standards, enabling them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that make a subculture unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic style that includes fashion, practices, and argot.
One of the most common ways we explain the importance of social life is by observing children who grew up in adverse conditions, experiencing abuse or hardship, and who did not learn to coexist with their caregivers.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some wild children have been confined by people (most often their own parents); in some cases, this child's abandonment is due to their parents' refusal to accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Abandoned children may have experienced severe child abuse or emotional trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the forest.
When fully raised by non-human animals, a feral child completely displays behaviors similar to those of wild animals (for example, fear or indifference towards humans).
While project-based learning can make learning easy and interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals who are starting a new learning process, for example, those using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Summaries can be both virtual and real. In other words, an instructor is a method of summarization, just like the little man who attaches paper in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are within the software and are designed to prompt, explore, and explain procedures that might be challenging for the student to grasp alone.
For various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even abduction, children are placed in foster care.
No child should grow up in an uncared for, uncaring, and uneducational environment, but they inevitably do.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is intended to provide all the essential things they lacked in their previous home.
The Internet combines the characteristics of mass and interpersonal communication.
In terms of the uses and gratification approach, the unique characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been identified as key motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
In addition, "personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" were identified as aspects of a new motivation when Eighmey and McCord (1998) examined audience responses to websites.
Video recording has led to important discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is believed that one can ascertain whether or not someone is lying by accurately interpreting micro-expressions.
In his essay titled "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks demonstrated how people unable to comprehend speech due to brain damage were still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He mentioned that such abilities to identify human character can also be shared by animals like domesticated dogs.
Research conducted in the twentieth century shows that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes from the expressed pool of variation.
The divisive difference of separation and reunification between the two pools with each generation.
In savannas, it is difficult for hominids with human-like digestive systems to satisfy their amino acid needs from the plant food sources available there.
Additionally, the inability to do this has severe consequences: depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources could have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for mammals like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily chewed and provide high amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All things considered, it shouldn't surprise us if our own ancestors, in some way, solved their "protein problem" just as chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of waking up during your regular sleep time and falling back asleep after a short period (10–60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the opposite side of the room so that you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking a lot of fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before your sleep, which forces one to wake up for urination.
A person's inner peace is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force becomes. Every person has the potential to find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can acquire knowledge. The only thing standing in the way is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is extended by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It involves Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a journey of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the power of awareness) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan Meditation Center is Divine Yoga. Through various deity visualizations, the energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and an enlightened consciousness is created.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, fostering cooperation between the USSR and the United States. When the war ended, conflicts of system, process, and culture led the countries to their downfall.
Two years before the war ended, the Cold War began as former allies had become enemies.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and the actual fighting would take place in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, Poland's defense was broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup with the Romanian military position.
However, these plans collapsed overnight after 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded Poland's eastern regions, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements, then entered and created Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships to transport goods; transporting many people and goods across the ocean is by far the most effective method available to date.
The traditional role of navies is to ensure that your country's ability to move people and goods is protected, and at the same time, to disrupt your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
A notable recent example of this is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly using U-boats.
Had the Allied nations fallen, Germany, after taking the entire rest of Europe, might perhaps have been able to capture Britain.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated in Iran's Zagros Mountains about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to expect them to easily provide milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats are usually kept in wandering herds in mountains or other grazing areas, and are often tended by children or adults who are like seasoned shepherds. These rearing methods are still used today.
In the early 16th century, Wagenhuis was built in England.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel planks, they enabled horses pulling them to achieve greater speed and to pull larger loads, even on the somewhat difficult roads of the day.
Crossties were introduced early on to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that tracks would be more effective if they had metal on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron on the wooden wheels of the wagons became more of a cause of damage.
Finally, wooden rails were replaced by iron. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known transportation was walking; people began to walk about two million years ago, associated with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning 'upright man').
The earlier ones, Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Although bipedal developments were found in Australopithecus fossils 4.2-3.9 million years ago, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become advocates to some extent to reduce future suffering.
In many ways, this is like symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, then we must find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is evident that the world has changed significantly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have been increasing due to population growth and humanity's excessive way of life.
After it was accepted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was taken to the printing house a few rows away from there.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies, now called "Dunlap Broadsides," were produced.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8.
The first was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlop broadsides known to date are ancient surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with teeth and claws, they lay eggs, and like a T-Rex, they walk on their two hind legs.
Currently, almost all computers are based on data transmission coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary digit has only two possible states: 0 or 1. And these digits are known as binary digits – or bits, to use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general for a quick diagnosis.
The best sign of internal poisoning could be the presence of open medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the text for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The word "tihuan" is the common name used by entomologists for a group of insects.
This word comes from an ancient species of bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to live close to humans.
Both biting mosquitoes and bed bugs are parasitic, adapted to live in their habitat or their parasitic dwelling.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
Couples can decide that raising a child is not their wish or not their child's wish.
This couple may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, parents terminate their parental rights for another couple to raise the children.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method guides most scientific research.
But not alone, testing—and an experiment is a test useful for eliminating one or more hypotheses—asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific inquiry.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's view is accepted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, Westerners found themselves separated from their Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often primarily determined by the existence of natural cycles and by their effective expression through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are largely unresponsive to external environmental cues have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators, maintaining free-running cycle times even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main arguments that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments by labeling DNA phage with radioactive phosphorus or protein phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutation can have various distinct effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only modifications made to germline cells can be transmitted to children, but modifications made to other cells cause the cell to die or cause cancer.
Nature-based tourism entertains people interested in visiting natural environments, plants and animals, including wildlife.
Examples of activities carried out on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is learning about, visiting, and photographing orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small rural towns to their workplaces, and others are passed by people whose work destinations are the places they just left.
In this dynamic transport system, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shaken the biosphere from the stable conditions that have supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, sometimes complaints about water quality and about bridges collapsing are heard equally.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Does it simply mean transport engineers are incompetent? Or is something more fundamental taking place?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows will have a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, design, and implement road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them easily escape enemies and efficiently find food and a mate.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings by retracting their bodies.
This provides them with a wide range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
While some people considered it correct, many people, on the contrary, believed that the solar system, including the sun and other stars, moved around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries over eight times more water than the second largest river.
Additionally, the Amazon is the widest river on Earth, sometimes becoming six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small tributary rivers.
Even though the construction of pyramids in stone continued until the very end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in their size and technical construction scale.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the smallest sovereign country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its constitution and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because all of them can be found in nature and are easy to mine with ancient tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements. They are earth, water, air, and fire.
This, just like the four states of matter (in the same order) - solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, proposed that they transform into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be alloys that include non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can fit within the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, when his pencil came out, it was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing styles emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and fewer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever needing to approach a recording device.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new arrives.
An explosive bomb operates on the principle of gathering all possible protons and neutrons into the nucleus to harness all power.
Like a heavy cart rolling down a hill. By re-splitting the nucleus, some of the energy is then released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay by breaking apart with little or no contact.
The moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The edge is 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
Under the marsh it is thin, and under the mountain it is thick.
There could be a lot of maria nearby because its crust is thin. It was easy for the lava to rise to the surface.
Current concepts are focused on finding what attracts people.
These concepts indicate that as people grow into adulthood, they have certain inherent needs and/or desires.
These concepts indicate what causes certain people to want to do the things they do, and what makes things in their surroundings behave in certain ways or not.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers begin to lead their former peers, two behaviors can emerge. One common one is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of regulator has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end, a person becomes an unknown individual who feels they must change everything the group was doing and make it their own.
Regardless, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often causes conflict between leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are associated with similar advanced levels as traditional teams, but they have subtle differences.
Virtual group members serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
More than typical team members, as they are often self-managing, they connect across various time zones that their local managers might not comprehend.
The existence of a true "covert group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of the virtual group.
The "Invisible Group" is a management team to which each of its members reports. The Invisible Group sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? It is to create a goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice.
If all available resources are properly utilized within the organization's departments, creativity and ingenuity will be highlighted.
For this reason, an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous method in which the institutional approach has been used to help organizations achieve high performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence regarding the theoretical approach to the investigation of perception. Therefore, it narrows the scope of the research and makes it more precise.
The relationship between the study of mental illness and behavior helps researchers in their research.
Various types of brain damage, emotional lesions, lesions, and internal tumors have long been known to affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to observe and examine brain structures and processes in unprecedented ways.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Despite AI's strong presence in science fiction, AI is a very important part of computer science that studies behavior, learning, and intelligence in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer inquiries and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Such things have become specialized systems, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military sectors, and are also integrated into many home computers and video game applications.
Field trips are an integral part of any class. Often, the teacher prefers to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution for virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquatic environments, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on the journey and share experiences for future lessons.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned annually, but previous versions remain online because they serve as a reference.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and writing, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often very critical audiences, the blog writer begins to strive to improve their writings to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging “compels students to gain more knowledge about the world around them.” The necessity to satisfy the audience's interest motivates students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to effectively enhance their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs strengthens students to be analysts and strong critics; by diligently responding to internet educational materials, students can express their stance in relation to other writings and also express their own perspective on certain issues (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's attractive, bilingual capital, home to many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is Muskoka and beyond that, untouched natural beauty.
All these things and more reliably position Ontario as what outsiders consider to be Canadian.
In the north, expansive areas are scarce, and some of them are uninhabitable deserts.
In a surprising population comparison, there are more African Americans living in the United States than the entire population of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Regarding wild animals, Madagascar is the largest of those that exist so far and is a continent in itself.
Most small islands are independent countries or are associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and it is very widespread in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers state they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also useful (though it shouldn't look too expensive).
Women should consider that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as harassment, and that being followed or grabbed by the hand, etc., is not uncommon.
Be strong in refusing men and don't be afraid to hold your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and served as a strategic port called Anfa for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, abandoning it again after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city, naming it Daru El Badia, and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least pleasant places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the old medina, it's easy to find traditional Moroccan items for sale such as clay plates, pottery, leather products, shisha pipes, and general souvenirs, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located at the eastern tip of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, most of the city's streets, especially the city center, were destroyed and buried by the Nyiragongo volcanic eruption.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside Goma must be researched to understand the ongoing combat situation in North Kivu province.
Adding that it is one of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa, the city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to go to Goma. The normal (local) price for a short trip is approximately 500 Congolese Francs.
Coupled with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become an archetypal symbol for rare and distant lands.
Still today, Timbuktu, even though its renown makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport, is a poor city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sands.
It was a major stop on Henry Louis Gates' PBS Wonders of the African World.
Because it has more of an Arab than African character, the city is completely different from the other cities of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each containing a different type of wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions, and is considered a main symbol of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It could be beneficial for one to buy a Wild Card, which provides a choice of entry to either parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gave its name to the Hong Kong territory, is a major attraction for many tourists.
The array of skyscrapers that form the Hong Kong skyline, shimmering due to Victoria Harbour, has been compared to a sparkling bar chart.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development has been built on reclaimed land along its northern coast.
This is a place the British colonizers took as their own, and therefore, if you want evidence of the region's colonial era, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) along the coastlines of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarban has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest within the Indian state is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not only mangrove swamps – they include the last remnants of the formidable forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which one-third is covered by water or marshy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has become a wildlife habitat, and it is currently estimated that there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart throughout the day from the district bus station (across the river), although most of them, especially those traveling to the East and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since local buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese Coaster buses.
Shared taxis like Paro (Nu 150) and Panuka (Nu 200) are fast and convenient ways to travel to nearby places.
The Oyapock River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the entire Oyapock River to connect Brazil's Oiapoque city and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high; the structure is 378 meters long and has two roads 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to the public until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs inspection is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were a very important indigenous group of the country, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture in what is now Eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region, like other indigenous tribes such as Guaycuru and Payagua, survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as “the giant province of the Indies,” emerged as a result of the encounters between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
Spaniards began a three-hundred-year colonial era.
Since its founding in Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve many indigenous characteristics and identities.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The year's grand competition will be held in December at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Here, small competitions and games can also be seen at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and polo matches, and where to buy tickets, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is set at par with one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank in Stanley, past the FIC West store.
British Pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US Dollars are also often accepted.
Although British and United States currency may be accepted, credit cards might not be accepted in the outer islands; confirm accepted payment methods with the owners in advance.
It is impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the island; therefore, exchange your money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter there, and conversely, it is summer.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone; during the summer months, temperatures of +30°C are common.
The winter can be surprisingly cold; the temperature sometimes drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons; the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although most animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other animals.
No matter how gentle they may seem, buffalo, wild boars, deer, bears, and all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year due to not keeping a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous; so give them space.
Additionally, know that smells attract bears and other wild animals; therefore, avoid carrying and preparing smelly foods and clean your campsite.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is on Upolu island and has a population of slightly less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port, making it the scene of a little-known naval confrontation.
Except for one British warship, all ships had sunk. About 200 American and German lives were lost.
A peaceful gathering in the city during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement resulted in the killing of the Great Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Oakland has many beaches due to its two ports. The most famous ones are located in three places.
The northern coastal areas (in the Northern Port District) are on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All are sandy beaches suitable for swimming, many of which offer shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive coastal resorts are on Waitemata Harbour in the expensive suburbs of Mission Bay and St H Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that can sometimes get crowded, and are surrounded by various types of shops. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', not a complex beer, but pleasant and satisfying. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to choose from, but New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is very different. The 'short black' is an espresso, cappuccino comes topped with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although the fruit juices are expensive, they are very good.
Throughout the year, trips are made into the sea, and accidents occurring due to these reasons within the sea are rare.
Still follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur north of 1770 from October to April, near coastal resorts and river estuaries. Outside these times, they can occasionally be found.
There are sharks, however, they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not truly reside in the ocean; their main habitat is the Estuary River north of Rockhampton.
Registering in advance gives travelers peace of mind, as they know there will be a place for them to stay upon arrival.
While you might find other types of accommodation like campgrounds bookable through a travel agent, travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or combined flight and hotel packages.
Also, if you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents (e.g., a visa) for your destination, they can hold the place for you.
However, any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent, not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival attendees decide to camp on site, and many participants consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to arrive early to get a spot near the music.
Even if the music on the main stages concludes, remember that there might be festival sections playing music until late into the night.
Some festivals have a special camping area for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, be sure to check the cabin layout, as traveling through ice can produce a very disturbing sound for those most sensitive to it.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos typically make many efforts to increase the time and money guests spend. Windows and clocks are often not found, and exits can be difficult to find.
They mostly have special food, drinks, and entertainment offerings so that guests stay in a good mood and remain in the lobby.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks for free. However, getting drunk impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the advantage of not being drunk.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or on mountain passes should consider that there might be snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, so you cannot drive as you would on dry asphalt.
Snow that can immobilize you can fall very quickly during deeply freezing, snowy conditions.
Visibility can be obstructed by falling or blowing snow, or by water mist, or by ice on car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries, snowy and icy conditions are common, and traffic mostly continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest draw for tourism in Africa and what makes it shine for many visitors.
The word Safari traditionally refers to traveling by land to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals like elephants and giraffes tend to approach vehicles, so standard equipment provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
Hiking (also known as "bushwalking," "trekking," or "going on foot") involves mountain climbing for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other areas across Japan.
Because it hosted the games in 1964, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodation before the extension was announced, you might be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies will not last until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
While standard tickets cost around ¥7,000, most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000.
Ironing wet clothes helps them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available to borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if ironed socks don't please you, you can use a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (it can cause wrinkling or, in some severe cases, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unfamiliar to them from their native areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause annoyance, or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can directly harm or kill humans, are usually not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy certain goods that are exempt from mandatory tax in specific areas.
Travelers to heavily-taxed countries can sometimes save a large amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh expressways between Point Marion and Fairmont frequently passes through rugged terrain, offering very difficult driving conditions.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be extra cautious: there are often steep hills, narrow roads, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits in the preceding and subsequent sections — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — are noticeably lower, and it is very important to strictly adhere to them rather than not comply.
Surprisingly, however, mobile service here is stronger than in other areas where the lines are laid, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweet cakes are excellent and in Bavaria, like their southern neighbor Austria, they are rich and diverse.
All year round, with apples ripening for pies and strawberries and berries appearing in the summer, fruit pies are common.
Many German baked goods include almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes usually pair exceptionally well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small sweet cakes, but depending on the region, try to find out what Berliner Pfannkuchen or Krapfen are.
Curry is a dish with meat or vegetables, based on herbs and spices.
Food sautéed with spices can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the northern and inland parts of India and Pakistan, yogurt is traditionally used in curries, while in South India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is mostly used.
Comprising 17,000 diverse islands, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that encompasses a wide variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
But, if used without any other qualifiers, the word refers to food that originated from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Currently widespread in the archipelago, Javanese cuisine uses lightly seasoned dishes, and the main seasonings loved by Javanese people include peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide the driver with greater stability, but they can pose safety risks because the driver's foot might get caught in them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but one foot is caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged while the horse runs. Many safety precautions must be taken to reduce the danger.
Initially, many riders wear their riding boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to come off the saddle when a rider about to fall is pulled backward.
Cochamo Valley - described as the 'Yosemite of South America' and Chile's main climbing destination, has numerous large granite walls and boulders.
High places feature breathtaking views. Climbers from all parts of the world are creating new routes on the endless wall.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding downhill on snow-covered ground with skis or a snowboard attached to one's feet.
Skiing is a major tourism activity with a large number of enthusiasts, known as "snow lovers," who plan entire holiday seasons around skiing in a single location.
The idea of sliding on snow is very old – pictures depicting snow sliders on caves date back to 5000 BC!
As a sport, downhill skiing dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing with a backpack: This activity is called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
Although often associated with Alpine-style ski touring or mountain hiking, it does not include these. The latter, when performed in tight terrain, requires very strong ski poles or plastic equipment and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a similar mountain trail.
In good conditions, you might cover a somewhat greater distance than walking – but without a heavy bag on a groomed path, you can sometimes even reach cross-country ski speeds.
In contrast, although Europe is a small continent, it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to different countries means you have to spend a lot of time with visa applications and passport control.
However, in this regard, the Schengen Zone operates as one country.
In this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to pass through passport controllers and checkpoints.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa individually for Schengen member states, so you save time, money, and paperwork.

Individuals undergoing pre-operative gender reassignment should not expect their privacy and dignity to be protected when undergoing examinations.
Rip currents are return flows of waves coming from the shore, often at a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in the shallower sections, and a swift current leading to deeper water can form there.

Travelers who had an easy time adapting to the new culture may sometimes find it particularly difficult to re-adapt to their original culture.
After living abroad, when you return home, you have become accustomed to the new culture and lost some of your home culture's customs.

People also do not understand that patience and understanding are essential for travelers returning to their homeland.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most popular things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and quietly before the show begins.

Finland is the best boating destination. "The Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a boat for an archipelago and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and large lakes are large enough for any ship, small boats or even a small vessel offer a unique experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, and one boat is for seven or eight people.
This is similar in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise varies greatly (e.g., in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
Most of the special Baltic ships will have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days, returning to sleep on the ship each night.
If you are going to the coast and only use short boat trips, you do not need a special visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise ships' brochures include Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a city tour is not included in the cruise fare.

If you send goods by air cargo, it may take several days to go through the unloading process and customs in some ways.
The only way to make it pass quickly was to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger; this is when you are needed.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to shell out a lot of money for that privilege (or, to have your company do it for you).
However, this doesn't come cheap: To put it simply, for business class, they can pay up to four times more than the regular economy fare, and for first class, up to eleven times!
Generally speaking, looking for discounts on business or first-class seats for direct flights from A to B is completely pointless.
Airlines charge accordingly because they are well aware that there is a certain core group of flyers willing to pay top dollar for the special privilege of reaching a destination quickly and comfortably.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of a region in eastern Moldova called the Transnistria Republic, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political agreements, economic relations have been re-established between those two parts of Moldova.
In Moldova, the main religion is Orthodox Christianity.

Please treat the site with full solemnity, calm, and respect. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by scratching or marking its structures with drawings and writings.

Similarly, men are also expected to wear trousers that cover their knees.
This can be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but that garment is not washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these gowns. One size fits all men!
Majorcan cuisine, similar to Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
