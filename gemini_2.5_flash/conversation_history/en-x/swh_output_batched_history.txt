While one experimental vaccine appears to reduce deaths from Ebola, so far, no drugs have been definitively shown to be effective in treating existing infections.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but official studies showed it had less benefit than expected in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics accepts the letter from the US Olympic Committee and acknowledges the Olympic family's critical need to foster a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, may be better served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, rather than decertification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation which will perhaps clarify how abuse of the scale as courageously described by the survivors of Larry Nassar would have gone undetected for so long and embraces important and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and USOC share one goal — to make the sport of gymnastics, and others, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowering environment.
Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as his advisor and also for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
During the 1976 election, he advised Carter on foreign policy, then worked as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, and took over from Henry Kissinger.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's feathers were reddish-brown on the upper side and light or carotene-colored on the underside.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur's feathers do not have a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but they do have other feather characteristics — barbs and barbules — researchers discovered that the rachis is probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flight but were used for thermoregulation or display. Researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not the soft down feathers of a chick.
Researchers suggested that, even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not the feathers of a young chick.
A car bomb that exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

They found that the Sun operated on the same fundamental principles as other stars: The activities of all stars in the system were found to be driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation work together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to convection.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the stars become in terms of magnetic changes.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but a program was developed to simulate the observed views of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls on the earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert force on the dark matter fluid of Sagittarius.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same conventional way.
This theory states that much of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located near the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many small particles.
Television reports show white smoke coming from the plant.
Local authorities are warning residents near the plant to stay indoors, turn off air conditioners, and not drink tap water.

"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Science Center and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters retreat to a booth, then place a pre-printed paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
Instead, French election law codifies the matter. Strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are added except those of counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following a specific procedure.

The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were extricating the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of killing his son.
He is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any witness testimony might be severely affected because his photo has been widely published in many places.
This is customary elsewhere in Britain, but Scottish law works differently and courts have viewed the publication of photos as prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University says "journalists appear to be putting themselves at risk by publishing photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which oversees prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no additional comments will be made at least until charges are filed.
The document, according to rumors, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics addressed reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands the continuation of a military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to withdraw that presence for only five years.
Snipers in an additional attempt to control disturbances were to be managed by guards, as the attempt would be monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four snipers selected for the first shooting operation received full training and safety instructions.
Martelly swore in a new interim Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the administration which began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, were triggered by the failure to hold elections, with one having been delayed since 2011.
Approximately 60 incidents of defective iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burn injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them about 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company said "were not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the deferral of the report by Apple "extremely regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said that no damage was reported in the nation.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman as she needed to relieve herself. Mendoza was attacked by gunfire.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and joined the medical profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the development of a baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found the aircraft's 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow boxers also mourned Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. Unique just as she was. A strong woman.”
Justin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was as broken as I was… perhaps even more so… you loved her and you will miss her… hopefully she is in a good place.”
For 1,400 people who participated in a poll before the 2010 federal election, those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the survey share these views, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
A plurality, 29 percent of those surveyed, believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle events and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his ailments, his health has been in doubt.
He could not take the required medication to relieve his pain because they have been banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is likely that comets were the source of transporting water to Earth, along with carbon-containing substances that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, as comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
He considered running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration claims would allow planes to use shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to track aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport is provided and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available there.
Fears of a lack of transport raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the creation of a new bird species in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species emerged in only two generations, although this process was believed to take much longer, due to cross-breeding between native Darwin's finches, Geospiza fortes, and immigrant large cactus finches, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be formed into various shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled to make sheets.
It can be made even thinner, and adhered to other metals. It can be made even thinner until sometimes it was used to decorate hand-drawn pictures called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that had their electrons stripped (since Hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders then, with clean, damp hands, form them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which you will feel as different and forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had modern toilets in nearly every house, connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where husbands and wives mingled together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use satellites.
The satellite in space receives the call then reflects it back down, almost instantly.
A satellite was sent into space using a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
You don't need a large rocket over 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to provide us with easy and fast transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transport.
Below it are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including beloved stray cats) that eat abundant tiny prey, such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a specialized role that each cat holds and that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are some of the most social felines, and they live in large groups called prides.
Lion prides consist of between one and three related adult males, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also dangerous to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump very far, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The leopard is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, jaguars, and leopards of South and Central America. Only these four cats are able to roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's great roar, but is more like a scolding statement with loudly delivered words.
Wild cats like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds if they can. Almost all animals that wild cats hunt are smaller than them.
Scientists think that wild cats follow and search for animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing to find where they were on the ground.
They have excellent night vision and also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the larger population they came from (like if they cross over mountains or a river, or move to a foreign island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in originally.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or practices to be stronger competitors than what they needed previously.
The original population has never changed; they still need the same old methods.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to look more and more different from the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., breathe out).
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses with plants and make our clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was a great predator of that time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurus.
Its large jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set on the roof of its mouth, meaning that anything it encountered would not escape.
We don't really know, but it might have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps it could have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a large dinosaur like T. rex would not stand a chance against it.
While many of their foods are familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual banquet items, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of mouse called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, rich people liked to have banquets together where they would recline on their sides while eating their food.
Ancient Roman meals would not include foods that entered Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of that god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to address the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each palace had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary into which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special tower-shaped pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temple.
The top part was the sacred abode of the god.
In the hot weather of the Middle East, a house was not very important.
Much of ancient Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
Women did cooking in the yard; stores were just open counters facing the street. Stones were used to build roads.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was sold at a very high price.
Greenland had few people. In Norse sagas they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when traveling further West, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, traditions and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you might think the treasure map was written behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Behind the Declaration of Independence were written the words “Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776”. That writing is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that that large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was folded for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the inscription was added to serve as a label.
The landing on the day of the attack and the subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied Forces attacked southern France, an attack called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization is a unified culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word 'civilization' comes from the Latin 'civilis', which means 'civil' or 'of a citizen', related to the Latin 'civis', meaning 'citizen', and 'civitas', meaning 'city' or 'city-state', and which in some way describes the size of the society.
City-states precede nations. A civilized culture signifies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a cultural footprint that persists over time and equitable distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government – with the U.S. Congress as its sole component – under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to levy taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce its laws.
It also lacked the authority to override laws and tax lists between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before amendment, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian football team, along with the German football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, field hockey and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the Northern regions, where Italians compete in international and Olympic games.
Japan owns about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), thereby making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the groups/clusters of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called, from a geographical standpoint, an "archipelago."
Taiwan began in the 15th century when passing English sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing changes in grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar farms.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main systems, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Many houses on the outskirts of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common still photography format is 35 millimeters, which was the main film size in the era of classic cinema.
It is still produced to this day, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat misleading, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is then said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or approximately equal to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates potential while maintaining a level of composition in a photograph.
It states that the most impactful place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which was rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound the states of Europe together despite having different languages and traditions.
Its widespread power influenced everyone from the king to the common person.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's financial resources are there specifically for that reason.
The church's main authority was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this presence of authority and money in one place led many to question whether this ideology was being implemented.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy was effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties in the last two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the sea, thereby endangering even neutral ships.
Since there was little reaction to this method, Germany expected similar responses to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of many citizens and nations was one of appeasement and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and brutality of war during the First World War, nations wished to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with only 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous employment) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each phase of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable period of divided states. Most famous among these periods was the Three Kingdoms era between the Han and Jin.
During these periods, fierce battles took place among nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest era in ancient Chinese history; thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest throne in Xi'an palace.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the change from a dictatorial stance to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution, employment was open to all male applicants, thus allowing the ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same applies to soldiers because instead of military power depending on class, it now depends on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this ordinary life. He frequently visited a cave that came to be known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the times, provides a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the world.
Indeed, it is never easy to find even if one knew it existed. Once you enter the cave, you are completely isolated.
Nothing else can be seen except the clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains surrounding it. Very little of this world can be seen or heard inside this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, is one of the largest buildings constructed in honor of the deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was designed to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper caret" symbol looks like a V and the "lower caret" symbol looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward bow stroke usually produces a quieter sound, while a downward bow stroke is more powerful and steady.
Feel free to write in your own bowing marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed bowing marks are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister Madame Elizabeth, filled with fear, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
In a horse-drawn carriage, they traveled towards Paris surrounded by a shouting crowd that hurled loud threats at the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
War expenditures for American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the people of the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Undoubtedly, the great profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people formed the primary income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templar, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events occurred is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention end around 1500.
Technological classification is a phrase that encompasses various views in practice, from driving technology, or technological development, to the concept that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and its manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two general views: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than social conditions.
For example, one might say that cars lead to the development of roads.
However, a national road system is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to many road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new methods in medicine for repairing broken bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural decisions influenced by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, traditions and cultures related to geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the state of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as a center of luxury, beginning around 400 A.D. and lasting until about 1100 A.D.
Its status deteriorated during the twelfth century primarily due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were more valuable than those offered by Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the transfer of the Fashion City from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was influenced by Byzantine cultures from the east.
However, due to poor communication channels, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the greatest developments of that time as a result of the crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is practiced for the production of just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system, using saved seeds native to the local area, along with crop rotation or simple alternative methods to improve yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
A subculture brings together like-minded people who feel alienated by social norms and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique because of the age, ethnicity, class, region, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that make a subculture unique may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, geographical, or a combination of elements.
Members of a subculture often signify their membership through unique styles that include clothing styles, behaviors, and language.
One of the popular methods used to show the importance of socialization is to use a few sad examples of children who, through neglect, misfortune, deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they were growing up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in other cases, this abandonment of children resulted from parents rejecting a child's severe mental or physical deficiencies.
Isolated children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma in their childhood before being released or escaping.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost exactly like those of the specific nurturing animal, such as its fear or disregard for humans.
While project-based learning should make education easier and more interesting, apprenticeship goes a step further.
Mentoring methods are not a way of studying but a service that provides support to people who are going through a new learning situation, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Platforms can be explicit as well as implicit; in other words, a teacher is a type of platform, but so is that paperclip figure in Microsoft Office.
Virtual platforms are embedded within software with the purpose of querying, persuading, and explaining procedures that might have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in Foster Care for many other reasons, ranging from abandonment to abuse and even abduction.
No child should grow up in an environment that is uneducated, uncaring, untaught, but they do.
We assume the Foster Care System to be a safe haven for these children.
Children's homes are supposed to provide safe housing, loving caregivers, a stable education, and a reliable healthcare system.
Children's homes are supposed to provide all these needs that were lacking in their original homes.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to more dimensions regarding its uses and gratification methods.
For example, "learning" and "social interaction" are suggested as important motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and "enduring relationships" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational factors when they investigated audience response on websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of subtle sounds, facial movements that last only a few seconds.
Particularly, it is claimed that one can identify if someone is lying by correctly interpreting subtle signs.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay A President's Speech, showed how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless capable of accurately assessing truth.
Even he suggests that such an ability to interpret human behaviors can be attributed to animals such as pet dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds genetic variations, and selection removes them from the collection of expressed variations.
The dynamic changes of separation and re-mixing back and forth between these two pools in each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for large animals with a human-like digestive system to satisfy their amino acid requirements from the available plant materials.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
Easily accessible plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for higher mammals like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In comparison, animal foods (termites, ants, eggs) are not only easily digested, but also provide high-quality proteins which contain essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved "their protein problem" in the same way that savanna monkeys do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep and falling asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done using an alarm clock that is not too loud so as to make you aware without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, to force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other chronobiological options involve consuming a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a popular remedy) before bedtime, a situation that compels a person to wake up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely related to the level of stress within their body and soul.
The lower the stress, the more positive the existing life forces are. Everyone has the ability to find more peace and contentment.
Everyone can gain understanding. One thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own worries and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the all-embracing path of love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, repetition of words or sounds, and visualization.
Central to Tibetan thought is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and enlightenment consciousness is awakened.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, thus leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the conflict of system, process and culture led to the separation of the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies turned into enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would truly be waged by proxy forces, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian borders after invading the eastern territories of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods on a large scale was the best way to transport masses of people and many goods by sea.
The role of the Navy has inherently been to ensure that your country can transport its people and goods, while at the same time, preventing your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most famous recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, German naval forces, using submarines, were trying to stop this traffic.
If the Alliance had failed, perhaps Germany could have defeated Britain just as it had defeated Europe.
Goats likely began to be domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Generally, domestic goats began to be herded in roaming groups in the mountains or other grazing areas, supervised by guardians who were often children or young youths, similar to the well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still used even today.
Horse-drawn carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon roads were loaded with parallel logs, they allowed horses to pull them faster and to pull relatively large loads on the poor roads of the day.
Crossties were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place. However, as time went on, it was discovered that the rails would perform better if a piece of metal was placed on top.
This became a custom, but the iron caused the wooden wheels of the pulled wagons to be damaged.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first solid iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of transport is walking; humans started walking upright two million years ago, after the emergence of upright humans.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not normally walk upright.
Bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two feet approximately seven million years ago.
We can start living as good friends of the environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can even become activists to reduce future stress to some extent.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not just want a short-term solution, then we ought to find the root of the problems, and put an end to it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed greatly because of human development in science and technology, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and wasteful human lifestyles.
After being accepted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 surviving Dunlap broadsides are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original handwritten copy is missing.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on processing information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits, in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that poison.
The word insect is used by entomologists in the formal application of this group of insects.
This word came from ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which have a great ability to parasitize humans.
Assassin bugs and bedbugs are accustomed to living in the nest or habitat of their host.
Throughout America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple Sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple might decide it is not in their best interest, or the interest of their child, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, birth parents terminate their parental rights so that other parents can raise that child.
The main goal of Science is to determine the way in which the world operates using scientific methods. In fact, this method guides many scientific studies.
It is not alone, however, experiments, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or two possible theories, asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on traditional texts, and specifically, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science were accepted, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge diminished, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific origins.
Many followed a pattern in physiology and behavior which often depend on the presence of natural cycles and their production through biological rhythms.
Regular rhythms, which are not merely a response to recurring external cues, have been recorded in many living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals,
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will maintain a self-driven cycle even without external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the proposals that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments to label DNA in viruses with radioactive phosphorus or viral protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for recreation and scenery, as well as plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about great apes in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside in cars heading to work, passing others who are heading to work where they came from.
In this robust transport system, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system that relies on private cars.
Science now indicates that this large carbon economy has removed the Earth's biosphere from one of its stable states that was supposed to sustain human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems evoke such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with their counterparts.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave with some consistency; therefore, traffic jams tend to have some stability and can be represented statistically.
To properly represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three main states: (1) flow, (2) density, (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and intelligent operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them easily escape enemies and find food and mates.
Many insects are fortunate to be able to fold their wings against their bodies.
This gives them ample opportunity for small hiding places from their enemy.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but most people believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, along with the Sun (and other stars).
This seems logical, because the Earth doesn't appear as if it is moving, or does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical quality of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent nation in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by many of those working in the government, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these can be discovered naturally in their native state and are easy to extract using ancient tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, proposed the idea that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was like the four states of matter (in that same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to create what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like Calcium and Potassium are usually considered as metals. In fact, there are other metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so much so that many trillions can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, that pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerge, the pencil is lowered in status and usage.
People now write messages on computer screens, never needing to use a sharpener.
One might wonder what the keyboard will become when something new comes along.
This fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required in the formation of nuclei with many protons and neutrons.
Just like rolling a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus once again then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to break apart even with a slight touch.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is known as the crust.
The Earth's surface is approximately 70 kilometers thick at its thinnest and 100 kilometers thick at its thickest.
The crust under the maria is thinner, but thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories aim to find what drives people or what motivates them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are ingrained as they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what concerns certain people that makes them want the things they do, and what factors in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers. On the one hand, they will try to identify themselves as "one of the guys" (or women).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, delegating tasks, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has been doing and make it their own.
After all, it is the leader who is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
That behavior often causes divisions between leaders and the entire team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of quality as conventional teams but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their physical group at that time.
Often they have more freedom than conventional team members since their teams can meet according to differing time zones and it may be unclear to their management.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is a unique feature of virtual teams.
The “invisible team” is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization go through a lengthy process to establish a learning organization? One goal of implementing learning organization concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the high-performing departments of an organization, innovation and proficiency can occur.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process for serving customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Chain method as a means used to help organizations achieve a high level of functioning.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical perspective on cognitive research. Therefore, it narrows the research area and makes it more specific.
The existing correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technology enables us to see and examine brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often associated with science fiction, Artificial Intelligence forms a very important part of the branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and mental adjustments for machines.
Research in AI involves developing working machines that require intelligent behaviors to be automated.
Examples include controlling, planning and coordinating, the ability to respond to customer identification and queries, as as well as text, voice and facial recognition.
Such matters have become different disciplines, aiming to provide solutions for life's problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as built into several home computer programs and video games.
Out-of-school trips are a major part of any classroom. Often a teacher likes to take their students to a place where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology provides solutions through virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or enjoy fine art while sitting in their classroom.
Participating together in a virtual field trip is also a good way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future travelers.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the State Capital, every year that website is updated, but old versions remain online to be used as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also enhance student writing. While students begin their blogging experience with grammar and spelling problems, the presence of a general audience changes that.
Since students are the most important audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to be knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's interest motivates students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration, and encourages students to broaden their reading beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet resources, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings as well as express their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is an attractive and bilingual Canadian city, and has a series of art galleries and exhibition halls that are packed with Canada's past and present history.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north is the core of Muskoka's hidden beauty and beyond.
All these things and many more display Ontario as it is naturally considered Canadian by outsiders.
The vast areas of the far north are sparsely populated and some of them are uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest by far, and a self-contained continent, when it comes to wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as coastal resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the areas, and it greatly affected Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: it is recommended that any female travelers say that they are married, despite their actual marital status.
It is also important to wear a ring (and not one that looks too expensive).
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, have one's arm grabbed, etc.
Be firm in rejecting people, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The current city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Near the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hooks, and a whole range of geegaws, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo located in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered much of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is largely safe, any visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, as well as the most accessible ways to track Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual fare for locals is 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Despite its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for extremely distant foreign lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and there is also an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stations during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, African Wonders of the World.
The city is in stark contrast with other cities in the country, because it has more Arab splendor than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 distinct ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's attractions and is considered to be principal among South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all National Parks in Southern Africa, there are daily conservation and entry fees.
It might be beneficial for someone to buy a Wild Card, which offers entry to some South African parks or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong region its name and is where many tourists focus their attention.
The Hong Kong skyline is complemented by a lively bar scene and is likely shaped by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To experience Hong Kong better, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Much of Hong Kong Island's city development is concentrated on reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This is where the English colonists considered it their own, and therefore if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial era, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland into Bangladesh and mainland India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian district is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps – they include some of the remaining great forests which were once covered by the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which one-third is covered by water/swamp.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been wildlife sanctuaries, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, although many, especially those heading east to Jakar / Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
As inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Many districts are served by Japanese Coast mini-buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel in nearby areas, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant group inhabiting what is now called Eastern Paraguay, living as nomadic hunters who also cultivated subsistence crops.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally known as the "Giant of the Province of the Indies," was born following confrontations between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen from here at other times of the year.
For information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is estimated to be equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
In general, British pounds will be accepted anywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; check with owners in advance to find out what payment method is accepted.
It is not possible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when the Northern Hemisphere is cold, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures exceeding +30ºC are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no specific “wet” or “dry” seasons: the amount of rain remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many wild animals are used to seeing humans, they are wild animals nonetheless, and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park management, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how calm they appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and nearly all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they failed to maintain an appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous foods and maintain cleanliness at the campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was a popular standoff site for navies in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk, except for one British vessel. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peace meeting in the city led to the assassination of high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland sprawling along its two harbors. The most famous ones are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and many of them are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are on Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent areas of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a range of shops along the waterfront. Swimming is safe.
The main beer in the area is ‘Number One’, it's not a complex beer, but it's good and refreshing. The other local beer is called ‘Manta’.
Many types of French wine are available, but New Zealand and Australian wines travel better.
The tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easier to obtain if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of 'white' coffee is foreign. A short black is 'espresso', a cappuccino comes piled higher with cream (not foam) and tea is prepared without milk.
The hot chocolate drink reaches Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes in the reef are rare.
Still, heed advice from authorities, obey all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Sea wasps occur near the coast and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. Sometimes they may be found outside these times.
Sharks are present, although it is rare for them to attack humans. Many sharks fear humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live much in the sea, as their primary habitat is river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives the traveler peace of mind that they will find accommodation upon arrival.
Travel agencies often have special offers and hotel deals, although you may also be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies usually offer package deals which include breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Any changes or requests must be pursued through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, a large number of music festival attendees decide to camp on site, and many consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to arrive early to secure a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even after the main stage music ends, there may be areas of the festival that continue to play music until midnight.
Several festivals have designated camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin's location, as passing through the ice causes considerable noise for those most sensitive.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. These passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the money and time spent by gamblers. Windows and clocks are usually absent and the exit is difficult to find.
They usually have unique food, drinks, and entertainment offerings, to entertain guests and keep them within their premises.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages in-house. However, intoxication impairs decisions, and all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone driving in elevated areas or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and extreme cold.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you are on bare asphalt.
During heavy icing, enough ice to get you stranded can fall in a short time.
Visibility can also be obstructed by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are common in many countries, and transportation continues all year round without disruption.
Safari tours are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari means to travel to see amazing African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to move closer to vehicles, and common equipment will provide good views.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (known as "bush walks", "trekking safaris", or going "on foot") involves trekking, whether for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will run from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some competitions will take place in different venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the unique Asian city to ever host two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend beyond July 2020, when the Olympics were originally scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 Yen and 130,000 Yen, with standard tickets costing approximately 7,000 Yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards for rent, even if one is not in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (as it could scorch, or in the worst case, burn).
There are different ways to clean water, some being successful against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; elsewhere, several minutes will be needed.
Filters vary in performance, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they do not recognize from their home areas.
Pests can damage food, cause nuisance, or in severe cases cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force, do not usually qualify as pets.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods without tax and duties in certain areas.
Travelers in high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, frequently passing through areas of isolated forest land.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are common.
Posted speed limits are much lower than those of previous and subsequent sections—usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour)—and strict obedience to them is more important than otherwise.
Surprisingly, however, mobile phone service is very strong here compared to other road networks like Pennsylvania Wilds.
German breads are excellent, and in Bavaria, they are even better and more diverse, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit tarts are common, with baked apples becoming tarts year-round, and cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many of the baked goods from Germany feature almonds and nuts. Popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but excellent doughnuts, try what depending on the region is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Pâté is a dish made from herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Pâté can be "dry" or "moist" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland areas of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in spicy sauces; in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is widely used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a generic name for the wide variety of cuisines found throughout the country.
But, when used without further adjectives, that word tends to mean food which originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The food most commonly found across wide areas of the archipelago is Javanese cuisine prepared with simple expertise, its basic taste being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports that hold the rider's feet, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider great stability, but they can be a safety concern due to the potential for the rider's feet to get caught in them.
If a horse rider is thrown from the horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, several safety measures can be taken.
First, many riders wear a tall boot with a smooth, very thin sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety stirrup bars that allow the stirrup leathers to release from the saddle if they are pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley – a major rock climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite and rock walls.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from their summits. Climbers from all over the world continue to establish new routes among its potential walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major activity with many participants, often known as "ski bums," planning entire holidays for skiing in a particular area.
The idea of board riding on snow is very old – cave paintings show snowboarders from ancient times as far back as 5000 BC!
Snow racing on slopes began at least in the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing with a backpack: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski trekking.
It is related to but usually not associated with high mountain ski tours or ski mountaineering, the latter being done in steep terrain and requiring stiff skis and boots.
Consider a ski trail as an analogous climbing route.
In good conditions, you'll be able to cover a relatively greater distance than walking – but you will very rarely achieve speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy pack on previously tracked routes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean having to apply for visas and passport control many times.
The Schengen Area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you remain within this area, you can cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member country individually, thereby saving time, money, and documents.
There is no general definition of which manufactured goods are antiques. Some customs organizations define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, where the age limit can be shorter in areas like North America than Europe.
Works of art can be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Arctic reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding that industry is also important for many who have other professions.
However, traditionally, not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived by fishing, hunting, and other such activities, and primarily raised reindeer as working animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although widely used, and especially among non-Romani people, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of Romani people.
If the country you visit is subject to a travel advisory, your health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance might be affected.
You might also want to consult government advice other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As one example, US citizens in the Middle East might face different situations from Europeans and Arabs.
The advisory is just a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The opinions presented are often quick, general, and overly simplified compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a common term for any dangerous weather condition and has the potential to cause damage, significant social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are many types that can depend on geography, land features, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, droughts, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are storms, hurricanes, waterspouts, and tornadoes.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather risks affecting their area as it might affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that is considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An internet search for 'Hostile environment course' might provide the address of a local company.
Normally the course will cover all issues discussed here in depth, and often along with hands-on experience.
Normally the course will take 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, many first aid services, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness life are common, but publications related to war zones are few.
Travelers intending to go abroad for sex reassignment surgery must ensure they carry valid documents for the return journey.
Government's willingness to issue gender-neutral (X) passports or updated documents to match the intended name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies as well.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Gay people should not expect to go through the screening process and come out of it with their dignity and privacy intact.
Backwash is the water that returns from waves breaking on the shore, usually on rocks or similar places.
Because of the underwater topology, the returning water usually concentrates in a few deep areas, and fast waves can form there in deep water.
Many deaths occur from exhaustion trying to swim against the waves, which can be difficult.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again or, depending on your skill or if you have been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock comes faster than culture shock (there's less of a honeymoon period), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Travelers who had an easy time adjusting to a new culture sometimes have a difficult time readapting to their original culture.
When returning home after living abroad, you have become accustomed to a new culture and have lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a foreign country need to adjust.
People might not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most exciting things in the children's area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the shows begin.
Usually you hear the sound of tourists and sellers. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set as a backdrop and a narrator of a long story.
Events are shown on the pyramids and different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have many bases, including sixteen that were active in 2020.
The islands are 120 kilometers north of the Cape. The largest is King George Island, which has the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a unique natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here join this plain, then re-emerge to form a 360-kilometer range of the Ellsworth Mountains, and are divided by the Minnesota glacial troughs.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, such as Vinson Massif, reaching a height of 4892, and Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without mobile phone signals, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone is not generally an alternative to a mobile phone, as you must be out in the open and have a clear line of sight to the satellites to make a call.
The service is frequently used by transportation, including luxury vessels, as well as expeditions with remote data and voice needs.
Your phone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
A growingly popular choice for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a year out before entering university, without affecting their studies.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap-year course abroad can actually improve your chances of pursuing higher education in your own country.
There will usually be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a good place for boating. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
For archipelagos and islands, you don't necessarily need a ship.
While coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are certainly big enough for any boat, a small boat or even a kayak offers a different experience.
Boating is an international sport in Finland, and there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite different (for example in the Netherlands the figure is one for every forty).
Most of the Baltic trips involve long stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several days while returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore on cruise trips, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin and Germany in their brochures. As you can see in the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and a trip to this city is not included in the price of the cruises.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown recently or have experienced a stressful event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's not very different from the personal fears and aversions that many people have.
For some, understanding how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear that is based on the unknown or not being in control.
Transport companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very important for commercial documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for small companies there was a problem.
If they were to send things by air cargo, on some routes it might take several days to complete unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through quickly was to send it as checked luggage. Airline rules won't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to travel in first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the opportunity (or, even better, have your company pay for it).
However, this doesn't come cheap: because of unspecified unfavorable rules, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual economy, business fare, and 11 times for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no need to even look for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain niche of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the right to arrive quickly and comfortably, and they adjust accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic nation that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, these conflicts led to the formation and self-declaration of the nation of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any United Nations member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political discussions.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna, now modern, developed, and a busy commercial hub, is situated around a large center and surrounded by mountains.
Wide streets, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers feature traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, old mosques and churches, although the city itself has a more European than traditional Turkish atmosphere.
The village of Haldarsvík has a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has a church with an unusual octagonal shape.
In the churchyard, there are impressive marble sculptures of doves on the grave.
It's worth half an hour to stroll through the charming village.
To the north and in an easily accessible location there is a romantic and charming town, made famous by visitors after recounting its glittering decorations as recorded by Lord Byron.
Skotabú bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a world-famous site of Marian apparitions.
Please note that you are primarily visiting a place with a mass grave, and also a place that holds unpredictable meaning for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who lived their time here, and many others whose loved ones were killed or worked to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat the place with all due dignity, order, and respect. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or carving inscriptions on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of them prefer to speak Catalan, a large number understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, many signs are displayed in Catalan because it is legally designated as the first official language.
Spanish is still widely used in public transport and other areas.
Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by automated systems using various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, aggressive, and arrogant.
While this is often just an unhelpful notion, the best way to get along in Paris is still to be on your best behavior, to act like someone who is "bien e’lev’e" (well-mannered). It will make getting along much easier.
The abrupt outward appearances of Parisians will quickly melt away if you show some basic courtesies.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is very forested, especially with beeches, pines, and fir trees, and a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes.
The area is also home to a very large variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and European capercaillie can be found there, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are expected to wear skirts that cover the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Many of the monasteries provide wraps for women who come without one, but if you come with your own wrap, especially one with a vibrant color, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Likewise, men are required to wear trousers that cover their knees.
These can also be requested from the stock at the gate, but those clothes are not washed after every user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing those skirts. One size fits all for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of other parts of the Mediterranean region, is made with bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and always uses olive oil.
A simple dinner, especially during summer, is often Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and other available ingredients such as cheese and tuna.
All nouns, including Sie for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat difficult due to the need to determine if a verb or adjective is functioning as a noun.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has relatively simple and often regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar resource will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand it better.
Needless to say, if you understand the language of love, it will be easy for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is very close and that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern research is generally not used today, and remains as museums, or parts of education.
Because light pollution in their time was not a problem as it is today, they are often in cities or universities, easier to access than those built in modern times.
Many modern research telescopes are key instruments in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China where plum blossoms were the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom ceremonies were organized by the emperor for himself and other participants in reconciliation surrounding the Imperial Court.
Plants look best if in their natural environment, so avoid the temptation to take even "just one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also get you removed, without discussion.
Singapore is generally a safer place to be and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after arrival.
But being located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to deal with a lot of heat (all the time) and intense sun (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also a few buses heading north of Hebron, the place of the traditional tombs of the Biblical heroes Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Ensure that the bus you are thinking of boarding goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a beautiful setting for a holiday.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or cruising through scenic areas along the Danube or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also define popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night in some open place to watch the sunrise.
Indeed there are Christian theological explanations of this tradition, but it may also have been a Spring and Fertility ritual before Christianity.
More traditional churches hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with believers celebrating exactly at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All native animals that arrived on these islands probably came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to complete the journey, with the giant tortoise being the primary herbivore in Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic and Antarctic regions during winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides an excellent opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, as the sky will be somewhat dark day and night.
Since those areas are not heavily populated, and little pollution is usually not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more systematic and formal than Western practices.
Suits are common business attire, and employees refer to their colleagues by their family names or by their professional titles.
Conformity in the workplace is important, emphasizing group efforts rather than praising individual achievements.
Employees often seek approval for any decisions they make from their supervisors, and are expected to obey the orders of their superiors without question.
