This confirms not only the widespread concept that dinosaurs had feathers, but also details that fossils cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers said this animal's feather color is dark brown on top and pale or orange underneath.
The discovery provides insight into feather evolution in birds.
Because the dinosaur's feathers lacked a developed shaft called a rachis, but had other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers say the rachis is an older evolutionary result of these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers was not for flight, but for thermoregulation or display. Researchers stated that although this was a young dinosaur's tail, the sample was a collection of adult feathers, not those of a chick.

They found that the basic principle by which the sun operates is similar to that by which other stars operate: that the movement of all stars in the system is guided by reflection, their rotation, and nothing else.
They used the amount of light and the rotation together to find the star's Rossby number, which correlates with plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic field reversals.

Although the work done was largely theoretical, the program was written to simulate the observations from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for is caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon has a gravitational pull on Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way has a gravitational pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter's effect on other dark matter is just like that of regular matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding the galaxy is found in a halo around the galaxy and is composed of many small particles.

In the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa, Dr. Tony Moll has discovered a severe, drug-resistant type of tuberculosis (XDR-TB).
In an interview, he said that the new variant is "very disturbing and frightening due to its very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have acquired the bug in the hospital, and Dr. Moll believes at least two were hospital healthcare workers.
Within one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people they come into close contact with.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB among the total number of people infected with tuberculosis still seems low; in South Africa, at any given moment, 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected with the disease.

Police said the body appeared to have been there for about a day.
At this time, the first cases of the disease were reported at the end of July.
Pigs carry the disease, which is then transmitted to humans through mosquitoes.
The outbreak of the disease forced the Indian government to take measures such as deploying pig herders in severely affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito nets, and spraying insecticides.
The government has promised several million vials of antiviral infection vaccine to help prepare health agencies for the next year.
Due to lack of funding and low priority compared to other diseases, plans to send vaccines to historically affected areas were delayed this year.

Infrared images show the caves to be cooler at night and warmer during the day.
During the day, they are cold relative to their surroundings, and at night they are warm.
Their thermal properties are not static like large caves on Earth that maintain a constant temperature, but this is consistent with these being deep pits in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience, with voters isolating themselves in a booth and placing a pre-printed paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the election register.
French electoral law strongly supports debates.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent for voters and observers to verify that they contain no envelopes at the beginning of the election, and that no other envelopes have been entered at the end of the election, apart from those of the counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

She has been remanded in custody awaiting charges and evidence, but any eyewitness evidence might not be admissible because she has been widely discussed in the community.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently, and courts view the publication of photographs as prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University said, "It seems journalists are treading a dangerous line if they publish photographs and other information about suspects."
The Crown Office, which is the general prosecutor, said it would not comment to journalists until there was evidence for prosecution.
The document, according to the leaked information, refers to the border dispute that Palestine wants, based on the pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
Other covered topics reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a continued military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed, while the PA only agrees to such a presence for five years.
In further pest control trials, shooters will be closely supervised by rangers as the trial is controlled and its effectiveness assessed.
Through the Sporting Shooters' Association hunting program, qualified volunteers were recruited in partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the early resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes-violent protests stem from the failure to hold elections, some since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods overheating and malfunctioning were reported; a total of six fires occurred, causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI stated that Apple had informed it of 34 more overheating incidents that the company called "not serious."
The minister responded by calling Apple's reporting delay "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (Friday 09:19 PM GMT).
The Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas' Emergency Management Office said there were no reported injuries in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated there was no tsunami threat.
A former Filipino policeman hijacked a bus in the Philippine capital, Manila, and held Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, as well as Filipino photographers, were released earlier.
Because she wanted to go to the toilet, the photographers took the old woman's place. Mendoza was killed by a gunshot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the maturation of the baby's fetal lungs.
Government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
Her fellow fighters also expressed their condolences to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night of two moons. Uniquely beautiful, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was very crazy like me... maybe more than me... I love her and miss her... We hope she is in a better place."
Among 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Queen Elizabeth II thinks Australia should become a republic at the end of her reign.
34 percent of those polled share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming events was also in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his injuries, his fitness was in doubt.
As he was banned from the Games, he could not take the medications needed to manage his pain.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number as of January 25.
Many people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software until early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets might be a source of Earth's water supply, along with organic compounds that can form proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed.
The 53-year-old Kumo began his administration earlier this year and signed the legalization of same-sex marriage last month.
He referred to the allegations as "political turmoil and folly."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow an aircraft to save a million gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon emissions by making shorter journeys.
Unlike the former ground-radar-based technology, it uses satellite-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No extra journeys are being added, and overground trains do not stop at Wembley; and park-and-ride facilities are not available on site.
Fears of transport shortages increased the possibility of the game being forced to take place behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the creation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species was formed in just two generations due to breeding between the rare Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the common cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris, even though it was presumed that this process would take a longer time.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small forms.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be bent and twisted. It can be flattened or rolled smooth.
It can be worked very thin and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was used for decoration on hand-drawn illustrations in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts."
This is called a chemical's pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage liquid.
Cabbage juice changes color based on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level in the tested chemical indicates the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron).
Knead the two dry powders together, then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, creating a funny sensation and forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a toilet with a flush in every house, connected to an advanced drainage system.
Remains of a drainage system have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women gathered together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and instantly reflects it back.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere alters some lights and views.
To put a satellite or telescope in space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is giving us very easy and fast transportation.
It has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Beneath them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized animals, from rabbits to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray pet cats) that eat a huge number of small animals such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a field, a unique task that prevents each cat from competing with the others.
Lions are highly social cats that live in large groups called prides.
Lion prides consist of one to three young males, up to thirty females, and cubs.
The females are often closely related to each other, many being families of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides, like wolves or dogs, are very dangerous for animals like lions (but not other big cats) and for their prey.
The leopard is a well-built athlete, able to climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The leopard is in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (Genus Panthera). These are the only four cats that can roar.
The leopard's roar is not a full-throated roar like a lion's, but rather more like a sequence of noisy sounds and snarls.
Ocelots/Desert cats like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds. Almost all of the animals Ocelots/Desert cats hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists find that Ocelots/Desert cats track the animals they feed on by sniffing their scent from the places where they were on the ground.
They can see well with night vision and can also move well. Ocelots find prey animals by blending in with their surroundings.
When a small population of living things separates from its original main population (for example, by crossing a mountainous area or a river, or simply traveling to a new island from which they cannot return), they often find themselves in an environment different from their former one.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new species requires different characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than it previously needed to be.
The original species never changed; they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, its similarity to other populations decreases.
በመጨረሻም ፣ ከሺዎች ወይም ከሚሊዮን ዓመታት በኋላ ፣ ሁለቱ ህዝቦች በመልክ በጣም ከመለያየታቸው የተነሳ አንድ ዓይነት ዝርያዎች መባል አይችሉም።
This process we call speciation, which means to create new species. Creating new species is an inevitable result and an essential part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale (i.e., that which is breathed out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, therefore it feared nothing except other Mosasaurus.
Its long jaws were armed with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and it had an extra set on the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it might have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly even its own offspring.
It would also attack anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex could not be its equal.
Although we know most of their food, the Romans had strange or unusual feast foods, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich liked to have a large feast where they would relax together on their sides while eating their food.
Ancient Roman meals could not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, nor even cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the gods.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to attend to the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the building was a special sanctuary for its god.
In the hot weather of the Middle East, the house was not very important.
Most of Hebrew family life was led outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops had open selling counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was settled in a dispersed manner. According to the Norse sagas, Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he sailed west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever his discovery, Eskimo tribes lived there at the time.
Even though each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even though there is something written on the back of the document, this is not a treasure map.
The words written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Even though no one knows for sure who wrote it, early in its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, the note might have been added only as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated Northern France; however, the South was still not liberated.
It was governed by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and, instead of fighting them, worked together with the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated Southern France and were heading back to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a society of large populations that live and work together.
The word civilization comes from *civilis*, which means civil, and is connected to the Latin *civis*, meaning citizen, and *civitas*, meaning city or city-state, which in some way describes the size of the society.
City-states are the predecessors of countries. The culture of civilization refers to the transfer of knowledge across multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and equitable distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as a formal civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially established a weak central government—meaning Congress became their sole body—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or court, it often relied on uncooperative state leaders to enforce all its laws.
It also did not have the power to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before their ratification, and because the states did not properly recognize the central government, their representatives were largely absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world after the German national team, and they were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
While Italians compete in international games and the Olympics, winter sports are most known in the northern regions.
Japan, comprising about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is called Honshu), makes it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to its cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" geographically.
Taiwan's story began in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by named the island Ilha Formosa or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in southern Taiwan by inspiring changes in the grain production practices of the natives and by hiring Chinese day laborers to work in its sugar and rice factories.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) controlled Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which controlled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings within the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better understanding of how they originally looked.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format was actually somewhat confusing, being 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) have this aspect ratio or one very close to it.
The ridiculed and laughed-at rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining a certain level of balance in an image.
It states that the most effective position for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into three (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion bound the states of Europe together despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its all-consuming power affects everyone from the elite to the common people.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's financial fund is specifically allocated for this reason.
The church's central authority has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this accumulation of power and wealth has led many to question whether its fundamental guiding belief is being fulfilled.
Soon after the conflict began, Britain started blockading the German navy.
Although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been established by several international agreements over the past two centuries, the strategy was effective by cutting off essential military and civilian supplies.
To prevent any British ship from passing over vast stretches of water, international waters were mined with bombs, which was a danger even for neutral ships.
Since there was only one specific response to the tactic, Germany anticipated a similar dispute for unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the predominant attitude of many citizens and nations was anti-war and isolationist.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents in his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China has a unique way of marking different time periods, where every Chinese era or family continuously in power had a clearly distinguishable dynasty.
And between each dynasty, there was an unstable era of divided states. The most notable of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, intense warfare took place among many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a bloody period in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people fighting and dying in their struggle for the highest seat in the Xian imperial court.
There are several social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from realism to populism, nationalism, and the idea that the country belongs to the people rather than a sole ruler.
Also, after the revolution, highly sought-after and successful professions were open to all male applicants.
The same was true for the military, because army rankings were now based on caliber rather rather than class.
The French Revolution inspired working-class people in many other countries who were under pressure to start their own uprisings.
Mohammed had a deep interest in matters beyond this ordinary life. He used to frequent the cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has survived from that era, provides a very clear picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave has been completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if one knows it exists, it is never easy to find. Once inside the cave, it is total isolation.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky surrounding the numerous mountains. From inside the cave, only a very small part of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
Located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, the "Giza Plateau" or "Giza Necropolis" contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the small pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and families.
The "upper fold" symbol looks like V, and the "lower fold" symbol looks like a staple wire or a square missing its bottom part.
Upward means, starting at the tip, you must push the bow, and downward means you must start from the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow usually produces a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more assertive.
You can mark your own scores with a pencil, but printed bowing marks are set for musical reasons and should therefore be respected.
The very frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister Madame Élisabeth were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by an angry mob of market women.
They returned to Paris, surrounded by many people shouting and making threats against the King and Queen.
The people who had gathered for the riot forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the mob was waving the head of a royal guard, who had been killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified Queen.
United States imperialism paid the cost of the war for the Filipino people.
In the name of the Philippine government, they agreed to pay for air expenses and bond interest through Wall Street banks to the U.S. purchasing power.
Indeed, the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people, as one of the most profitable ventures established, brings fundamental benefits for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must grasp the circumstances that prompted the formation of the religious group.
The period in which the events occurred is known as the High Middle Ages, encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300) in European history.
The High Middle Ages are preceded by the Early Middle Ages and are followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends in 1500.
Technological determinism is a strong conviction that, in practice, encompasses several ideas, ranging from technology-push or technological necessity to an inclination to believe that human destiny originates from a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and the manifestation of technology.
Most definitions of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a largely autonomous path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies themselves rather than being shaped by social conditions.
For example, it can be said that the motor car inevitably leads to road development.
But for a few cars, a national road network is not economically viable, so new manufacturing methods were established to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The ownership of many cars also leads to a high incidence of accidents on the road; this leads to the creation of new techniques to repair damaged body parts.
Romanticism had a major component of cultural determinism derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, cultures related to geography and rules that suited a society's location were considered superior to creating arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was called the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until 1100 A.D.
In the twelfth century, the situation declined because primarily Christian crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued more than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style emerged between the 10th and 11th centuries and reached its peak in the 14th century.
Initially, dresses were highly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, lifestyles in the West could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style of dress. One of the greatest developments of the time due to the wars was that people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture means when a farmer has a crop that can only benefit him and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system that is often organic, using heirloom seeds native to the ecosystem, maximizing yields by combining them with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary based on the members' age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that make a subculture unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signify their membership through a unique and symbolic style that includes fashion, mannerisms, and argot.
One of the most common ways we try to explain the importance of social life is by looking at children who grew up in adverse conditions, abuse, or suffering, who did not learn to live together with their caregivers.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children were locked away by people (often their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's severe mental or physical impairment.
Abandoned children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals, some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When entirely raised by non-human animals, a feral child fully exhibits traits similar to those animals (for example, fear or indifference towards humans).
While project-based learning may make learning easy and interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals who are starting a new learning process, for example, those using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher, just like attaching a document in Microsoft Office, is a small form of scaffolding.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded within the software and are intended to inquire about, examine, and explain procedures that might be challenging for the student to grasp alone.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even theft.
No child should grow up in an uncaring, unloving, and uneducational environment, but they invariably do.
We view the foster care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the essential things that were missing in the home they were previously taken from.
The Internet combines the characteristics of mass media and interpersonal communication.
Regarding the uses and gratifications approach, the Internet's unique characteristics lead to additional dimensions.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" have been suggested as crucial motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Additionally, "personal involvement" and "ongoing interactions" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when examining audience responses to websites.
Video recording has led to important discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is believed that by accurately interpreting micro-expressions, one can ascertain whether someone is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech," indicated how people who were unable to understand speech due to brain damage were still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He mentioned that such abilities to identify human behavior can also be shared by animals like domesticated dogs.
Research conducted in the twentieth century shows that there are two pools of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the manifest pool of variation.
Between the two pools, with each generation, there is a flux of variation from separation and recombination.
In the savanna, it is difficult for hominids with human-like digestive systems to satisfy their amino acid requirements from the plant food sources available there.
Additionally, failing to do this has severe consequences: depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for mammals like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily chewable and offer proteins containing all essential amino acids in high amounts.
All things considered, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the savanna somewhat like chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of consciously waking up during your regular sleep time and falling back asleep after a short while (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your sleep, it can be placed across the room to make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives include drinking a lot of fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, which forces one to wake up to urinate.
The inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life energy. Every person has the potential to achieve perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can acquire knowledge. The only thing standing in the way is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but is extended by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and an all-encompassing journey of love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini power (power of awareness) is awakened by Yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is divine Yoga. Through inspiration from various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy that forged cooperation between the USSR and America. When the war ended, clashes of system, process, and culture led the countries to fall apart.
Two years before the war ended, the Cold War began as former allies were now enemies.
It would last for the next 40 years, and the actual fighting took place on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize with the Romanian military position.
However, these plans collapsed overnight when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, invaded Poland's eastern regions and created Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most effective way to move many people and goods across the ocean.
The traditional task of naval forces is to ensure that your country maintains its capacity to move people and goods, and at the same time, to disrupt your enemy's capacity to move people and goods.
One of the most recent examples of this that should be written about is the World War II North Atlantic campaign. The Americans were trying to move people and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly using U-boats.
Had the Allied nations fallen, Germany might have been able to occupy Britain, just as it had occupied the rest of Europe.
Goats first appear to have been domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Most often, domesticated goats have been kept in herds roaming mountains or other pastures, often with young or adult individuals similar to known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
In the early 16th century, the Wagenways were built in England.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel planks, they allowed horses to pull larger loads faster than the somewhat difficult roads of the day.
Cross-ties were introduced early on to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had iron ore on top.
This became a common practice, but iron became more of a cause of damage on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron. In 1767, the first entirely iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking, with people beginning to walk two million years ago, associated with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning 'upright man').
The earlier ones, Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Although advancements in bipedalism were found in Australopithecus fossils 4.2-3.9 million years ago, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living more friendly to the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become advocates to some extent to reduce future suffering.
This is like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, then we must find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is clearly evident that the world has changed significantly due to scientific and technological advancements, and problems have been increasing due to the human population and humanity's excessive lifestyle.
After it was accepted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was taken to a printing house a few rows away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies, now called "Dunlap Broadsides," were produced.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the Independence Hall yard on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
So far, the 25 known Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one dinosaur group survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that make them look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with teeth and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers are based on information transmission encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number has only one or two places; that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary numbers – or bits, to use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that they may not lead to a quick diagnosis.
The best sign indicating the presence of internal poisoning could be the presence of open medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The word "bed bug" is the common name used by entomologists for a group of insects in their formal classification.
This term comes from the ancient lineage of bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to live close to humans.
Both stinging insects and bed bugs are parasites adapted to live in their host's nest or habitat.
Across America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
Couples may decide that raising a child is not their desire or not in their child's best interest.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise their children.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method indeed guides most scientific research.
However, it's not alone; experimentation, which is a test used to rule out one or more hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's view was accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, Westerners found themselves separated from their Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed phenomena in physiology and behavior are often primarily determined by the existence of natural cycles and their productivity on biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that do not respond easily to external seasonal cues have been recorded for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a free-running cycle even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading ideas that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments by tagging the DNA phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein phage with radioactive sulfur.
A mutation can have various distinct effects based on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, but mutations in other cells cause the cell to die or produce cancer.
Nature-based tourism entertains people interested in visiting natural environments to enjoy plants and animals, including wild animals.
Examples of activities performed on site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is learning about, visiting, and photographing orangutans in Borneo.
People drive from small rural towns to their workplaces every morning and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they left.
In this dynamic transport system, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has destabilized the biosphere from the stable state that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar complaints are sometimes heard about water quality and bridge collapses.
Why do transportation systems evoke such complaints; why do they fail daily? Does it simply mean that transportation engineers are incompetent? Or is something more fundamental at play?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows will have some reasonable consistency and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operations of roadway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them easily evade enemies and efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their bodies.
This provides them with a wide range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
While some people thought it was correct, many people, on the other hand, believed that the solar system, including the sun (and other stars as well), moved around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries over eight times more water than the second largest river.
Furthermore, the Amazon is the widest river on Earth, sometimes becoming six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small tributary rivers.
Even though pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in their size and technical scale of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by their predecessors' monuments, which were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest sovereign state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its regulations and its official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican City citizens are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all these can be found in nature and are easy to mine with ancient tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
Although this is like the four states of matter (in the same order) — solid, liquid, gas, and plasma — he proposed that they transform into new elements to create what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Also, there can be alloys that include non-metal elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
So, when the pencil came out, it was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing styles emerged, the pencil was reduced to a lesser role and fewer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever needing to approach a writing instrument.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The explosive bomb operates on the principle of gathering all possible energy from protons and neutrons into the nucleus.
Like a heavy cart rolling down a hill. By splitting the nucleus again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to disintegrate spontaneously.
The moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thin under the maria and thick under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Current concepts are focused on finding what attracts people.
These concepts suggest that people, as they grow into adulthood, have certain ingrained needs and/or desires.
These concepts indicate what makes certain people want to do what they do and what makes things around them cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two prominent content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, when managers begin to lead their former peers, two behaviors can emerge. One is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of supervisor has difficulty making unpopular decisions, performing disciplinary actions, conducting performance appraisals, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end, one turns into an unknown individual who feels that they should change everything the group had been doing and make it their own.
Regardless, it is ultimately the leader who takes responsibility for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often provokes conflict between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same high standards as traditional teams, but they have subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team serve as contact points for their immediate physical team.
They are often more self-managed than traditional team members, connecting across different time zones that local managers may not grasp.
The existence of a true "shadow team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique aspect of the virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the process of taking the time to establish a learning organization? One goal is to put the concepts of organizational learning into practice.
If all available resources are properly utilized within an organization's work units, innovation and ingenuity will stand out.
As a result, an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous method in which the institutional approach was used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence concerning the theoretical approach to perception research. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The connection between neuropsychiatric research and behavior assists researchers in their work.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, lesions, wounds, and internal tumors affect behavior and bring about changes in some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to observe and examine brain structures and processes in unprecedented ways.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand processes within our brains.
Although AI has a strong presence in science fiction, AI is a very important part of computer science that studies behavior, learning, and intelligence in machines.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer inquiries and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face.
Such things have become distinct systems, which are focused on providing solutions for real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now mostly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military sectors; they are also integrated into many home computers and video game applications.
Field trips are a main part of any class. Often the teacher prefers to take her students to places where it is not possible to go by bus.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips. Students can observe museum artifacts, visit aquatic environments, or appreciate beautiful art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on the trip and share experiences for future lessons.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their annual trip to the state capital; every year the website is updated, but existing versions remain online because they serve as a reference.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Even if students often start their blog experience with poor grammar and writing, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often very critical audiences, the blog writer begins to strive to improve their posts to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to have more knowledge about the world around them." The need to cater to audience interests encourages students to be knowledgeable and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blog writing is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to effectively develop their learning beyond the regular school day.
The proper use of blogs "empowers students to be analysts and strong critics;" by diligently responding to internet educational materials, students can express their position in relation to other texts as well as express their own views on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's attractive, bilingual capital, where several art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present are located.
To the south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is Muskoka and beyond that, untouched natural beauty.
All these things and more reliably position Ontario as what outsiders consider typically Canadian.
To the north, vast areas are scarce, and some are uninhabited wilderness.
In a surprising population comparison, there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located off the eastern coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Regarding wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or linked to France and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, and it spread widely in Comoro and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advisable for any female traveler to state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (one that doesn't look too expensive, though).
Women should also consider that cultural differences can lead to what they might perceive as harassment, and being followed, having one's hand pulled, etc., is not uncommon.
Be firm in refusing men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, serving as a strategic port called Anfa for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, abandoning it again after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city, naming it Daru El Badia, and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find traditional Moroccan goods like pottery, ceramics, leather products, shisha pipes, and general trinkets for sale, but this is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located near Rwanda on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
In 2002, Goma was largely destroyed and buried by the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, particularly the city's central streets.
While Goma is relatively safe, any trips outside Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, in addition to being one of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The standard (local) price for a short trip is ~500 Congolese Francs.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to serve as an archetypal symbol for rare and distant lands.
Even today, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite its fame making it a tourist attraction, and even though it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS Wonders of the African World.
Having more of an Arab than an African appearance, the city is a striking contrast to the rest of the country's towns.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to its southern boundary.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each containing diverse wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It might be worthwhile to purchase a Wild Card, which offers preferential entry to parks within South Africa as well as to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gave its name to the Hong Kong territory, is a place many tourists consider their main attraction.
The array of skyscrapers that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a shimmering bar chart due to Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is squeezed onto reclaimed land on its northern shore.
This is the place the English colonists took as their own, and therefore, if you want evidence of the region's colonial era, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove coastal expanse, stretching 80 km (50 miles) along the borders of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest portion within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include the last remnants of the formidable forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², a third of which is covered by water/swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife habitat, and it is currently estimated that there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart throughout the day from the district bus station (across the river), although most, especially those traveling to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intra-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese coaster buses.
Shared taxis like Paro (Nu 150) and Panuka (Nu 200) are fast and convenient ways to travel to nearby places.
The Oyapock River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the entire Oyapock River to connect Brazil's city of Oiapoque and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters long, and it has two 3.50-meter-wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to the public until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checks are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were a very important indigenous group of the country, living as semi-nomadic hunters and practicing subsistence agriculture in what is now eastern Paraguay.
Other indigenous tribes of the Chaco region, like the Guaycuru and Payagua, survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously referred to as "the vast territory of the Indians," came into being as a result of the Spanish conquerors' encounter with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial era that lasted three hundred years.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain many indigenous characteristics and identities.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official Falkland Islands currency is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is set equal to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the Islands' only bank, located in Stanley, just beyond the FIC West Store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
While British and US currency may be accepted, credit cards may not be accepted on the outer islands; confirm with owners in advance what forms of payment are accepted.
Falkland Islands currency is impossible to exchange outside the islands; therefore, exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a semi-tropical region; in summer months, temperatures of +30°C are common.
The winter can be surprisingly cold; the temperature sometimes drops below freezing point, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons; the rainfall amount remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although most animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other animals.
However gentle they may seem, bison, wild boars, deer, bears, and all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year by not maintaining the proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous; so give them space.
Additionally, be aware that scents attract bears and other wild animals; therefore, avoid carrying or preparing smelly foods and clean your campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on Upolu Island and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a little-known naval confrontation when seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
Except for one British warship, all ships sank. About 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of Paramount Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
In Auckland, due to two ports, there are many beaches. The most well-known ones are located in three places.
Northern Shore beaches (in the North Port District) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches suitable for swimming, and many offer shelter provided by Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive coastal recreation areas are on Waitematā Harbour in the affluent inner-city suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are often crowded family beaches with various shops surrounding the beachfront. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', not a complex beer, but pleasant and satisfying. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to choose from, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are concerned, it is easy to find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is very different. A short black is an 'espresso,' a cappuccino comes piled with cream (not foam), and tea is also served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but very good.
Trips are made into the sea throughout the year, and injuries caused by factors originating from the sea are rare.
Still, take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur north of 1770 from October to April near coastal resorts and river mouths. Outside of these times, they can be found occasionally.
There are sharks, however, human attacks are rare. Most sharks fear humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not permanently reside in the ocean; their main habitat is the Estuaries River in the northern part of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking gives travelers peace of mind, knowing that they have a place to stay upon arrival.
While you might be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent, travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or combined flight and hotel packages.
Also, if you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents (e.g., visa) for your destination, they can hold the place for you.
However, any modifications or inquiries should be handled by the travel agent, not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most of the music festival participants decide to stay on site, and many participants consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to arrive early to find a spot near the music.
Even if the music on the main stages ends, remember that there might be parts of the festival playing music until late into the night.
Some festivals have a separate camping area for families with small children.
In winter, if you are crossing the northern Baltic, check your room's position, as traveling through ice causes a very disturbing sound for those who are sensitive.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos typically make great efforts to increase the time and money guests spend. Windows and clocks are often unavailable, and exits can be difficult to find.
They mostly have special food, drink, and entertainment offerings to keep guests in a good mood and for them to stay at the entrance.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages for free. However, getting drunk impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the advantage of not getting drunk.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or on mountain passes should consider that there might be ice, snow, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low; you cannot drive as you would on bare asphalt.
Heavy freezing snow that can immobilize you can fall very quickly.
Visibility can be obstructed by falling or blowing snow, or by water spray, or by ice on car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries, icy and snowy conditions are common, and traffic mostly continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps what significantly attract tourism in Africa and are a highlight for many visitors.
The word safari typically refers to traveling by land to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to approach cars, so standard equipment provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are better seen with binoculars.
Hiking (also called "bushwalking", "trekking", or "going on foot") involves walking for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Because it hosted the games in 1964, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Winter Olympics.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodations before the extension was announced, you might be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies lasting until the end of March will not extend until the Olympics' scheduled date of July 2020.
While typical tickets cost around ¥7,000, most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000.
Ironing wet clothes helps them to dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for borrowing, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron or if you don't like ironing socks, you can use a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (it can cause wrinkles or, in some severe cases, scorching).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are effective for specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests in their host areas that they are unfamiliar with.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit bites.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill humans by force, are often not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy certain goods that are exempt from mandatory tax in specific areas.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh expressways between Point Marion and Fairmont, frequently passing through isolated terrain, presents very difficult driving conditions.
If you are unaccustomed to driving on country roads, maintain your caution: steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower in the preceding and subsequent sections—typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and it is highly beneficial to adhere strictly to them rather than disregard them.
Surprisingly, however, mobile service is stronger here than in other places where the line is stretched, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are very cool and, in Bavaria, are as rich and varied as their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples ripening into baked goods all year round, and strawberries and berries appearing in summer.
Many baked goods in Germany also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often specifically paired well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small sweet cakes, but depending on the region, try to find out what Berliner Pfannkuchen or Krapfen are.
Curry is a herb and spice-based dish with meat or vegetables.
A spice-fried dish can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland areas like North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries, while in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is typically used.
Comprising 17,000 alternative islands, Indonesian cuisine is a blanket term covering a wide variety of regional food types found across the country.
But, if used without any other additions, the word refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely found in the archipelago, Javanese cuisine involves lightly seasoned dishes, and the main seasonings favored by Javanese people include peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang from the sides of the saddle.
They provide more stability to the rider but can have safety risks because the rider's foot can get stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but one foot is caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged when the horse runs. Many safety precautions must be taken to reduce the risk.
Firstly, many riders wear their riding boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if a falling rider is dragged back.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, dubbed the Yosemite of South America, has several different large granite walls and boulders.
The high places include astonishing views. Climbers from all parts of the world are creating new routes amidst endless walls.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding downwards on snow-covered ground with skis or a snowboard attached to one's feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, known as "snow lovers," who plan entire holiday seasons around skiing in one place.
The idea of sliding on snow is very old—cave drawings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
As a sport, downhill skiing goes back at least to the 17th century, and the first recreational skiing club was opened in Australia by Norwegians in 1861.
Traveling with a ski bag: This activity is called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
Although often associated with Alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, it does not encompass these, as the latter are performed in narrow terrain and require very sturdy long wooden or plastic skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar mountain climbing route.
In good conditions, you might cover a somewhat greater distance than walking – but without carrying a heavy bag, you can sometimes achieve cross-country ski speed, though rarely on a groomed trail.
Europe, by contrast, although a small continent, has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through different countries means you would have to spend a lot of time with visa applications and passport control.
The Schengen Zone, however, operates like one country in this regard.
Within this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport controls and checkpoints.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa separately for Schengen member countries, thus saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no international definition for what constitutes an antique among manufactured items. Some tax organizations describe goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations in places such as North America, where the age limit is shorter than in Europe.
Handicraft products, even if they are younger than similarly mass-produced items, can be described as antiques.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood in Sami, and the culture around the trade is important for many alongside other professions.
Traditionally, however, not all Sami were involved in large-scale herding of Eurasian and North American reindeer; instead, they lived by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and used Eurasian and North American reindeer for carrying loads.
Today, many Sami work in modern businesses. In the Sami area in Sápmi, tourism is an important source of income.
Although widely used, especially by non-Romani people, the word "Gypsy" is considered offensive through its connections with negative attitudes and misconceptions about Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult governments' advice other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, in the Middle East, American citizens may face different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisories are only a brief summary of the political situation within a country.
The views presented are quick, general, and highly simplified when compared with more detailed information from other sources.
Severe weather is a general term for dangerous weather that can cause damage, significant social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere on Earth and has many types that can depend on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones, as well as high winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires, are forms and effects of severe weather.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, ice storms, hail storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risks that may affect their location as severe weather can impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that can be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
Searching the internet for "hostile environment training" may provide a local company contact.
The course regularly covers all the topics described here in great detail, largely with practical experience.
The course regularly lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, extensive first aid, and sometimes combat training.
Books and magazines referring to wilderness survival are common, but texts that deal with war zones are few.
Those who have planned gender reassignment surgery abroad and are coming to the airport for their trip must ensure they carry the proper documents.
Governments vary in their willingness to issue updated documents for passports with an unspecified gender (X) or to match a desired name and gender.
Foreign governments' willingness to honor these documents varies widely as well.
Screenings at security checkpoints have become much more intrusive since the era following September 11, 2001.
Pre-operative transsexual people should not expect to pass through screenings with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are return flows from the shore in response to incoming waves, often at a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in the shallower sections, and a fast current leading to deeper water can form there.
Many deaths, improbably, occur due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current.
Once out of it, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to find your way back from a place where you are not caught again, or you can await rescue depending on your abilities and how visible you are.
Re-entry shock precedes culture shock (with little or no honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who had an easy time adapting to a new culture can sometimes have an exceptionally difficult time re-adapting to their existing culture.
After living abroad, when you return home, you have become accustomed to the new culture and have lost some of your home culture's habits.
Initially, when traveling abroad, people were perhaps patient and understanding because they knew travelers had to adapt to the conditions of the new country.
People do not understand that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning to their home country.
The Pyramid Sound and Light Show is one of the most popular things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and quietly before the show begins.
Often, the sounds of tourists and vendors are heard here. The story of the sound and the light is just like a fairy tale book.
The hidden person is designed as a background and as a narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids and various pyramids light up.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by many countries and have many stations, sixteen of which were operational in 2020.
The islands are located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a flooded volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a territory located in the southern peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then, separated by the Minnesota Glacier, they rise again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, contains Vinson Massif, which includes Mount Vinson, Antarctica's largest mountain, at 4892m altitude.
In remote areas out of cell phone coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone is not an overall mobile phone replacement, as you need to be outdoors with clear lines of sight to see the satellite directly when making a call.
The service is frequently used in transport, including for recreational crafts and journeys that require remote data and voice needs.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For people planning a vacation, an increasingly popular option is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with school leavers, as it allows them to take a year before university without disrupting their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap-year program abroad can actually improve your chances of gaining admission to higher education in your home country.
Typically, there will be tuition fees to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent boating destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a boat for the archipelagos and on the lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are big enough for any vessel, smaller boats or even a dinghy offer a unique experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, and one boat is for seven or eight people.
This is comparable in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is very unique (e.g., in the Netherlands the number is one for forty).
Most special Baltic ships will have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days, returning at night and sleeping on the ship.
If you only use short excursions provided by the cruise line to go ashore, you do not need a special visa (as of 2009).
Some ships include Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and the city tour is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a scary experience for people of many ages and from various places, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
It is nothing to be ashamed of; it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes many people have.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help them confront a fear based on the unknown or something beyond their control.
Shipping companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Most of the time, this is very important for business documents, transactions, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but this has been a problem for other routes and smaller companies.
If you send goods by air cargo, on some routes it can take several days to go through the unloading process and customs.
The only way to make it go through quickly was to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, which is when you are needed.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or have your company do it for you).
However, this doesn't come cheap: simply put, you can pay up to four times more than the regular economy fare for business, and up to eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, it's completely pointless to look for discounts on business or first-class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of flyers willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political agreements, economic relations have been re-established between those two parts of Moldova.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of around 3.7 million, Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, now a modern city, it is a developed and bustling commercial center; it had a large bay surrounded by mountains.
Its wide roads, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century markets, and old mosques and churches, though the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby Eysturoy island and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are striking marble sculptures of doves on some of the graves.
The journey to the charming and fascinating village is worth about half an hour.
To the north, the wonderfully charming and amazing city of Sintra, which is difficult to access, became popular with foreigners after a wonderful history recorded by Lord Byron.
Scoturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Further north, visit the world-renowned site of Marian devotions, the Sanctuary of Our Lady Saint Virgin Mary.
Remember that you are primarily visiting a large graveyard and also a site of immeasurable significance for many people around the world.
There are still many surviving men and women who endured their time here, and many who had loved ones, both Jewish and non-Jewish alike, who were killed or worked to death there.
Please view the site with all due appropriateness, calmness, and respect. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by scratching or marking drawings and writings on the building structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, many signs are displayed in Catalan only, as it is the legally established primary official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other institutions.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese through the public address system.
The people of Paris were selfish, arrogant, and haughty.
While this is mostly just a misconception, the best way to fit in in Paris, by being a "bien élevé" (well-bred) person, is still about your best behavior.
If you show basic courtesies, the Parisians' initial reserved exterior will quickly disappear.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, primarily with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and has a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean flora.
Due to small climatic differences, varied soil, and altitude, it has various plant communities within it.
The area is also home to an extremely diverse range of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and capercaillie can be found there along with many common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are expected to wear skirts that cover their knees and must also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer wraps for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially brightly colored ones, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are also expected to wear trousers that cover their knees.
This can be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but that garment is not washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these garments. One size fits all men!
Majorcan cuisine, similar to Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (specifically pork), and uses olive oil on everything.
A light, popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any condiment available such as cheese, tuna fish, etc.
All nouns, except for the word for 'you,' always begin with capital letters, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish certain verbs and predicate verbs.
It arguably makes reading easier, but writing becomes complicated as we need to know whether we have used a verb or an adjective on a word form that represents a noun.
In Italian, pronunciation is relatively easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters that need careful attention are c and g, as their pronunciation can vary depending on the following vowel.
Additionally, make sure to distinguish between 'r' and 'rr'; "caro" means dear, while "carro" means carriage.
Persian has comparatively simple and often regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar beginner's guide will help you learn more about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
Nevertheless, people who know a little Spanish might hastily conclude that it is not necessary to study Portuguese separately, as it is similar.
Pre-modern space exploration stations are now mostly obsolete, and are preserved as museums or educational sites.
In earlier eras of civilization, light pollution was not the kind of problem it is today; they were often found in cities or campuses that were easier to reach than those currently being built.
Most modern research telescopes are massive facilities located in remote areas with good climatic conditions.
Known as Hanami, the cherry blossom viewing, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept was derived from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom celebrations centered around the emperor himself and other imperial rulers.
In their natural habitat, plants look their best, so oppose even the attempt to remove a single "specimen."
When visiting a well-arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will undoubtedly get you expelled.
Singapore is generally a very safe and easy place to live and explore, and you can practically buy everything after you arrive.
But if you're located just a few degrees north of the equator in the "deep tropics," you'll need to endure the heat (always) and strong sun (very rarely when the sky is clear).
In addition, there are a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Ensure the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Kiryat Arba, the Jewish settlement.
Waterways will be a good theme to base the festival on.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a boat trip to fascinating cities along the Danube, or traveling by boat along the Erie Canal.
They have also opened routes for popular walking and cycling paths.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holidays are inherited from non-Christian countries and non-believers in Christianity from around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter Eve awake in an exposed place to see the sunrise.
Indeed, there are Christian religious expressions for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and birth ritual.
Many traditional churches often celebrate Easter on Saturday evening, with the congregation entering into the celebration of Christ's resurrection at midnight.
All the animals that arrived early on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey, so the giant tortoise has become the primary grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar nights, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
As time goes on and the sky becomes quite dark, this provides a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis.
Since the areas have few inhabitants, and light pollution is usually not an issue, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and rule-bound, unlike what Westerners are accustomed to.
A suit is formal work attire, and colleagues address each other by their family names or job titles.
Workplace harmony is important, with a focus on team effort rather than individual achievements.
Employees must mostly get the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to accept their superiors' instructions without question.
