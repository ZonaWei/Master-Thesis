This not only confirms the widespread concept that dinosaurs had feathers, but also details that fossils cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers have stated that this animal's plumage is dark brown on top and pale or orange on the bottom.
The discovery provides insight into feather evolution in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a developed shaft called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers say that the rachis is the result of an evolution older than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers is not for flight, but for thermoregulation or display. Researchers stated that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample is a collection of adult feathers and not from a chicken.

Although the performed work was mostly supported by theory, the program was written to simulate observations from the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the group was seeking is caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon has gravitational force on the Earth and raises tides, so too does the Milky Way have gravitational force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The scientists have been able to reach the conclusion that the effect dark matter has on other dark matter is just like that of normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter found around the galaxy is located in a halo surrounding the galaxy and is made up of many small particles.

Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following certain procedures.

When emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT, the road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoiya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her child.
She has been taken into custody, awaiting charges and evidence, but any eyewitness testimony might not be admissible because she has been widely discussed in the community.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently, and courts view the publication of photographs as prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University stated, "If journalists publish photos and other information of suspects, it seems journalists are treading a dangerous line."
The Crown Office, which is the general prosecutor, has stated to journalists that it will not provide any comment until there is evidence for the charges.
The document, according to leaked information, refers to the border dispute sought by Palestine, based on the border from before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other undisclosed topics, as reported, include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred for both countries and for the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel wants a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed, while the PA, for its part, agrees to such a presence for only five years.
In an additional pest control experiment, applicators will be closely supervised by observers, as the experiment was controlled and its effectiveness evaluated.
Through the Sports Shooters Association's hunting program, qualified volunteers were recruited in partnership with NPWS and the Australian Sport Shooters Association (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received a comprehensive safety and training briefing.
Martelly has been sworn into the new nine-member Transitional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the early release of CEP as part of a package of measures to take the country to a new election.
The commission was Martelli's response to the extensive anti-regime protests that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests arise from the failure to hold elections, some of which have been ongoing since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating and malfunction have been reported; in total, six fires occurred, resulting in minor burns to four people.
Japan's Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it had identified 27 accidents related to its equipment.
Last week, METI stated that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents which it called "not serious."
The Minister responded by calling Apple's report framing "truly regrettable."
The earthquake hit Marina at 07:19 AM local time (Friday 09:19 PM GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said that there were no reported damages in the country.
Similarly, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has been holding Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as Filipino photographers, have already been released.
Because she wanted to go to the restroom, the photographers took the old woman's place. Mendoza was killed by a gun.
Following in his father's footsteps, Ligins joined the medical profession.
Having received training in obstetrics and gynecology, they began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Ligins began to study premature labor in his spare time.
His study shows that if a hormone is administered, it accelerates the baby's fetal lung maturity.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Her fellow fighters also expressed their condolences to Luna.
As Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night of two moons. Uniquely beautiful, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was very crazy like me… maybe more than me… I love her and I miss her… We hope she is in a better place."
Before the 2010 federal election, among 1,400 people surveyed, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Of those polled, 34 percent share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming also participated in three relay races for us at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was in doubt due to his injuries.
Because he was barred from the games, he could not take the medicines needed to cope with the pain.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has found the largest prime number by January 25th.
The discovery was confirmed by many people using various hardware and software by early February, and it was made public on Tuesday.
Comets could perhaps be a source of water supply to Earth, along with organic substances capable of creating proteins and supporting life.
Since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed.
The 53-year-old Kumo began his rule at the beginning of this year, and a bill to legalize same-sex marriage was signed last month.
He referred to the allegations as 'political turmoil and foolishness'.
They are estimated to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA announces enables an airplane to save millions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon emissions by making shorter trips.
Unlike older ground-radar-based technology, air traffic controllers use satellite-based technology to identify aircraft with high accuracy and to provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional services are being added, and Overground trains do not stop at Wembley; and no on-site car parking is available at our Park & Ride facilities.
Fears of transport shortages increased the likelihood that the game would be forced to be held behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the creation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species was formed in just two generations, as a result of interbreeding between *Geospiza fortis* (a rare Darwin's finch) and *Geospiza conirostris* (the common cactus finch), despite expectations that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be bent and coiled. It can be hammered into flatness or rolled.
It is made very thin and attached to another metal. So thin could it be made that it was used for decoration on hand-drawn pictures in books called 'Illuminated Manuscripts'.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage liquid.
Cabbage juice changes color based on the chemical's acidity or basicity (alkalinity).
The pH level in the tested chemical is indicated by the concentration of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which their electrons have been removed (therefore, hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron).
Sift the two dry powders together, then with clean wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands rubs against the outer layers, which has a peculiar feeling and forms a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet in every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
The remains of the sewage system were found in houses in Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled together.
When you call someone living thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives its call and instantly reflects it back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Since the Earth's atmosphere alters some light and observations, researchers use telescopes in space.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a massive rocket over 100 feet tall is required.
The wheel has astonishingly changed the world. The greatest thing the wheel did for us is that it provided very simple and fast transportation.
He has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Under them, there are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that eat a great many small animals such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a field, a unique task that prevents each cat from competing with another.
Lions are very social cats that live in large groups called prides.
Lion prides are formed by one to three young males, up to thirty females, and cubs.
The females are often very closely related to each other, many being families of sisters and daughters.
Lionesses, like wolves or dogs, are very dangerous to animals such as lions (but not other big cats) and their prey.
The leopard is a powerfully built athlete, capable of climbing (though not well), swimming, jumping great distances, and pulling with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (Genus Panthera). Only these four cats can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like a noisy sequence of phrases and distinct roaring calls.
Ocelots/desert cats like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds. Almost all the animals ocelots/desert cats hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists find that Ocelots/wildcats track and locate their prey by sniffing out the places where they were on the ground.
They have good night vision and can move efficiently. Ocelots locate prey by blending in with their surroundings.
Small living things (small populations), when they move from their main population (for example, if they cross a mountainous region, or a river, or travel to a new island from which they cannot easily return), often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has various resources and different competitors; therefore, the new species requires various traits or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than previously needed.
The original species has not changed at all; they still require the same accommodation as before.
Over time, as the new people begin to adapt to their new environment, their similarity with other peoples decreases.
In the end, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will have diverged so greatly in appearance that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. The formation of new species is an inevitable result and an essential part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe, and also absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is, what is breathed out).
Plants prepare their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants, and we also make clothes from plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Animals cannot live without plants.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasauruses.
Its long jaws were armed with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and it had an additional set on the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that came its way.
We do not know for certain, but it might have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might even have been a cannibal.
It would attack anything that entered the water, and even a giant dinosaur like a T. Rex could not be its match.
Although we know most of their food, the Romans had exotic or uncommon banquet foods, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of mouse called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women eat food sitting on chairs, the rich prefer to hold a large banquet where they socialize together on the side as they eat their meals.
Ancient Roman foods could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or even cocoa, and there was not a single ancient Roman who tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered a house of gods.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to attend to the gods' desires through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary into which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the building was a special sanctuary for his god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not very important.
The life of most Hebrew families was lived outdoors.
Women cook food in the yard; shops were open stalls facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he sailed westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever his discovery was, Eskimo tribes were living there at the time.
Even though each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film 'National Treasure', you might think that a treasure map was written behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even though something is written on the back of the document, this is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words 'Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776'. The text appears inverted at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, early in its history, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, the note might have been added only as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated Northern France; however, the South was still not free.
It was administered by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Alliance invaded Southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated Southern France and were returning to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a society, among vast populations who live and work cooperatively.
The word 'civilization' comes from 'civilis', which means 'civil', and is connected to the Latin 'civis', which means 'citizen', as well as 'civitas', meaning 'city' or 'city-state', which in some way describes the size of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. Civilizational culture signifies the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable distribution.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving important historical evidence and are not recognized as established civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially established a weak central government—meaning Congress was their sole body—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Council had no authority to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or court, it often relied on uncooperative state leaders to enforce all its laws.
Additionally, it did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between the states.
Before the articles are ratified, they require unanimous consent from all regions, and because the regions had not properly acknowledged the central government, their representatives were mostly absent.
The Italian national football team is the most successful team in the world after the German national team, and they were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
While Italians compete in international games and the Olympics, winter sports are most prominent in the northern regions.
Japan is comprised of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the world's 7th largest island!
Because of its collection of islands, Japan is often called an "archipelago" in geographical terms.
The history of Taiwan began in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by named the island Ilha Formosa or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its foundation in southern Taiwan by prompting changes in the indigenous people's grain production practices and by hiring Chinese day laborers to work in its sugar and rice factories.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885, they declared Taiwan to be a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, surrendering sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, and the island was controlled until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures called the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
To give tourists a better understanding of how they originally came into being, most of the buildings within the compound have been rebuilt.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the reconstruction work still continues.
For example, the most common image photograph format in the world is still 35mm, which was the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is produced to this day, but its aspect ratio has been superseded by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format was actually somewhat confusing, measuring 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest overall numerical ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The cumbersome and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating versatility while maintaining a certain level in the image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into three (see example).
During this period in European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under investigation.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound the European states together, despite linguistic and cultural differences. I
Its all-destructive power touches all, from the greatest to the least.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's financial fund is specifically allocated for this reason.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this accumulation of power and money has caused many to question whether its fundamental guiding principle is being compromised.
Soon after the conflict began, Britain began to blockade the German navy.
Even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries, the strategy has been effective by cutting off essential military and civilian supplies.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from passing over vast stretches of water, which was a danger even to neutral ships.
As there was only a limited response to the tactic, Germany was expecting the same for unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the predominant characteristic of many citizens and nations was anti-war sentiment and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrific and cruel nature of war during the First World War, countries wanted to prevent such a situation from recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to take a job at Edison's company in New York City.
He entered the US carrying 4 cents, a poetry book, and a letter of gratitude to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor).
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different periods of time; every Chinese historical period, or every family in power, had a clearly distinguishable dynasty.
And it was an unstable period of fragmented states between each dynasty. The most notable during these times was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times, a severe war took place among many princes struggling for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was a bloody time in ancient Chinese history, where thousands of people fought and died as they struggled to sit on the highest seat in the Xi'an Palace.
There are several social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from authoritarianism to popular sovereignty, nationalism, and the idea that the country belongs to the people rather than a sole ruler.
Also, after the revolution, professions that were in high demand and enabled success were open to all male applicants.
It was the same for the soldier, because in military ranking, they were now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution inspired working-class people in many other countries who were under pressure to start their own revolts.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this ordinary life. To meditate, he used to frequent the cave known as 'Hira'' on Mount Nur (Light).
The cave itself, which has survived from that era, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Being situated on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave was completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In truth, even if one knows of its existence, it is never easy to find. Once one enters the cave, it is total isolation.
Except for the clear, beautiful sky around the many mountains, nothing is visible. From inside the cave, only a very small part of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, is one of the many large pyramid structures erected to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The "Giza Plateau" or "Giza Necropolis," located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and families.
The "upper fold" symbol looks like a V, and the "lower fold" symbol looks like a stapler wire or a square missing its bottom part.
"Up" means that you must push the bow, starting from its tip; while "down" means that you must begin from the frog (which is the part of the bow your hand holds) and draw the bow.
The upstroke usually produces a soft sound, but the downstroke is stronger and more emphatic.
You can mark your own score with a pencil, but the printed bowing marks are placed for musical reasons, and therefore they must be respected.
The greatly startled King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris by an angry mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris, surrounded by many people making shouts and threats against the king and the queen.
People gathered for a riot forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the mob was brandishing the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the startled queen.
United States imperialism paid the cost of the war to the Filipino people.
In the name of the Philippine government, they agreed to pay unspecified costs and bond interest through Wall Street banks for U.S. purchasing power.
Indeed, the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people, one of the most profitable established ventures, will yield fundamental interests for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must comprehend the circumstances that led to the formation of the religious group.
The time when the events took place is known as the High Middle Ages in European history: the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages are preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends in 1500.
A strong feeling inclined to think that technological determinism, encompassing many ideas in practice from technological imperative or necessity to human destiny, originates from a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and the manifestation of technology.
Most definitions of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a largely independent path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the motor car necessarily leads to road development.
However, a national road network for small cars is not economically viable, so new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Owning many cars also results in a high incidence of road accidents; this, in turn, leads to the development of new techniques for repairing damaged components.
Romanticism had a major element of cultural commitment stemming from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and subsequently, cultures associated with geography and laws that aligned with the society's place were better than making arbitrary rules.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was called the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
The reputation of being a main center of luxury lasted from 400 A.D. until 1100 A.D.
In the twelfth century, the situation deteriorated, primarily because Christian warriors returned with gifts like silk and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine market could offer.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, the dress had a great influence on Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication methods, lifestyles in the West can be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style of dress. Due to the wars, one of the greatest developments of the time was that people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture means when a farmer has produce that can only benefit himself and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system, done by using saved seeds native to the ecosystem and combining them with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures, by bringing together like-minded individuals who feel excluded by social standards, enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Internal cultures can vary based on the members' age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that make a subculture unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic style that includes fashion, practices, and argot.
One of the most common ways we use to explain the importance of social life is by observing children who grew up in adverse conditions, injustice, or suffering, and who did not learn to co-exist with their guardians.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (often their own parents); in some situations, this abandonment of the child is due to the parents' non-acceptance of the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Discarded children might have experienced severe child abuse or emotional trauma before being discarded or fleeing.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the forest.
When fully raised by non-human animals, a feral child fully displays characteristics akin to a distinct animal (for example, fear or indifference towards human beings).
While project-based learning should make learning easy and interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support that helps individuals who are starting a new learning process, for example, those using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Conclusions can be both hypothetical and actual. In other words, a guide, much like the little man who attaches a document in Microsoft Office, is a way of summarizing.
Virtual scaffolds are within the software and are intended to prompt the student to inquire about, explore, and explain procedures that might be challenging for them to manage independently.
Children are placed in foster care due to various reasons such as neglect, abuse, and even theft.
No child should grow up in an uncaring, inattentive, and uninstructive environment, but they inevitably do.
We view the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessary things they lacked in the home they were previously taken from.
The Internet combines the characteristics of mass and interpersonal communication.
Regarding the approach to usage and satisfaction, the unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions.
For example, 'learning' and 'socializing' have been identified as crucial motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Furthermore, "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) in their examination of audience responses to websites.
Video recording has led to important findings in interpreting subtle expressions and facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Particularly, it is believed that by accurately interpreting micro-expressions, one can ascertain whether a person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks, in his writing titled 'The President's Speech,' pointed out how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage were able to accurately assess sincerity.
He mentioned that such abilities, like the human ability to discern characteristics, can also be shared by animals such as trained dogs.
The study conducted in the twentieth century shows that genetic variation has two pools: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the existing pool of variation.
The controversial difference of separation and reunification between the two basins with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with a human-like digestive system to meet their amino acid requirements from the plant food sources found there.
Additionally, the inability to do this has severe consequences: depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources could have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for mammals like us to digest unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily chewable and provide a high amount of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their 'protein problem' to some extent, just as savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of consciously waking up during your regular sleep time and falling back asleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking up from your sleep.
If you see yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the opposite side of the room to make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before your sleep, which forces one to wake up to urinate.
A person's inner peace is inversely related to the amount of tension within their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force becomes. Every person has the potential to attain perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can acquire knowledge. The only thing standing in the way is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but extended by the Mahayana path of compassion and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and an all-encompassing journey of love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the power of awareness) is activated by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan Meditation Center is Divine Yoga. Through the inspiration of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and a luminous consciousness of knowledge is created.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, fostering cooperation between the USSR and the USA. When the war ended, systemic, procedural, and cultural conflicts led the nations to collapse.
Two years before the war ended, the Cold War began because the former allies had become enemies.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and the actual fighting took place on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, Poland's defense was broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize with the Romanian military position.
However, these plans failed overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, invaded Poland's eastern regions and subsequently established Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships for transporting goods; for transporting many people and goods across the ocean is by far the most effective method of all those available so far.
The traditional role of naval forces is to secure your country's ability to transport people and goods, and simultaneously to disrupt your enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the recent examples worth noting is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic mainly using U-boats.
Had the Allied powers fallen, Germany, having already occupied the rest of Europe, might perhaps have been able to take Britain.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to expect milk, hair, meat, and hides to be easily given to them.
Domestic goats are mostly kept in roaming herds in mountains or other grazing areas, and often, both young and adult ones are found with a known shepherd. These husbandry methods are still in use today.
In the early 16th century, Wagenways was built in England.
Although the chariots consisted only of parallel planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speed and enabled the hauling of larger loads, instead of merely navigating the somewhat challenging roads of the day.
To keep the tracks in place, crossties were introduced very early on. However, it was gradually realized that tracks would be more effective if they had iron on top.
This became a common practice, but iron became a greater cause of damage on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by metal. In 1767, the first fully metal rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. Humans began walking two million years ago, a development associated with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning 'upright man').
The early ones, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as a habit.
Although developments in bipedalism were found in Australopithecus fossils 4.2-3.9 million years ago, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can begin to live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the local movement, and we can even become advocates to reduce future hardship to some extent.
This is in many ways like a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not merely seek a temporary solution, then we must find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is clearly known that the world has changed significantly due to scientific and technological advancements, and problems have been increasing due to human population growth and humankind's excessive lifestyle.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was taken to a printing house a few blocks away from there.
All night long, between 150 and 200 copies, now called “Dunlap Broadsides,” were made.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8.
The first was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. The copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 extensive Dunlop works known to date are ancient copies preserved from the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds; they resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with teeth and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers are based on data transmission encoded as binary numbers.
A binary digit has only two possible values; namely 0 or 1. These values are known as binary numbers—or bits, to use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently general that they may not allow for a rapid diagnosis.
The best sign indicating the presence of internal poisoning could be the presence of open medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the text if there are special first aid instructions for that special poison.
The word 'bug' is the name formally used by entomologists for an insect group.
This word originates from an ancient species of bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to living close to humans.
Both mosquitoes and bed bugs are parasitic, adapted to live in their own dwellings or in their host's dwelling.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has confirmed that the likelihood of women contracting MS is double that of men.
Couples can decide that raising a child is not their desire, or that it is not their child's desire.
This couple might choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the children.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, greatly guides scientific research.
But it's not just that; testing and experimentation, a useful test to eliminate one or more hypotheses, asking questions, and conducting observations also guide scientific inquiry.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and particularly on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's view is accepted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, Westerners found themselves separated from their Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often primarily determined by the existence of natural cycles and the functioning of biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that do not readily respond to external temporal cues have been recorded for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators, which maintain a free-running cycle even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading ideas that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments by labeling DNA phage with radioactive phosphorus or protein phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutation can have a variety of distinct effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected segment of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only modifications to germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while modifications to other cells cause the cell to die or lead to cancer.
Nature-based tourism provides enjoyment for people interested in visiting natural environments, including plants, animals, and wild animals.
Examples of activities carried out at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is learning about, visiting, and photographing Orangutans in Borneo.
People drive from small rural towns to their workplaces every morning, and others are passed by people whose work destination is the place they left behind.
In this dynamic transportation landscape, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a private car-based transport system.
As science now indicates, this massive carbon economy shows that it has destabilized the biosphere from the stable conditions that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality and the collapse of bridges are sometimes heard equally.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Does it simply mean transport engineers are incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles and their interaction between two points.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows will exhibit a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help to plan, design, and perform operations for road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to go into the air. Their ability to fly helped them easily evade enemies and efficiently find food and a mate.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings by retracting their bodies.
This provides them a wide range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
While some people thought it was true, many people, on the contrary, believed that the solar system, including the sun and other stars, moved around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It holds 8 times more water than the second largest river.
Additionally, the Amazon is the widest river on Earth, sometimes becoming six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small tributary rivers.
Even though the construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza Pyramids were never surpassed in their size and the technical scale of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest sovereign state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its constitution and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by most working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these can all be found in nature and are easy to mine with ancient tools.
The philosopher Aristotle put forth the concept that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
This, just like the four states of matter (in the same order) — solid, liquid, gas, and plasma — proposed the transformation into new elements to create what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Indeed, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Also, alloys that include non-metallic elements such as carbon can exist.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, when he came out, he was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing styles emerged, the pencil was reduced to a lesser status and uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever needing to approach a typing device.
When something new comes, one can only wonder what will become of the keyboard.
An explosive bomb operates on the principle of collecting all possible energy by gathering protons and neutrons into the nucleus.
Like a heavy cart rolling towards a hill. By re-dividing the nucleus, a certain amount of energy will then be released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they have a tendency to disintegrate by separating with little or no contact.
The moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The edge is 70 km thick on the near side, while it is 100 km on the far side.
Under the arid lowlands, it is thin, and under the highlands, it is thick.
Nearby, there could be a lot of maria because the crust is thin. It was easy for the lava to rise.
The current concepts are centered on finding what attracts people.
These concepts indicate that as people mature, they have certain needs and/or desires designed into them.
These concepts indicate what makes certain people want to do what they do, and what makes things around them do or not do certain things.
Two prominent content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, when managers begin to lead their former peers, two characteristics may emerge. One approach is to try to continue being 'one of the guys' (or gals).
This type of supervisor has the challenge of making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, it shifts to an unknown individual who believes that a person should change everything the group was doing and make it their own.
Regardless, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often causes conflict between leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups are held to similar high standards as conventional groups, but they have subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical team.
More so than typical group members, as they are often self-governing, they meet at various schedules incomprehensible to the administrators around them.
The existence of a real "hidden team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The 'Invisible Team' is a management team where each of its members reports. The 'Invisible Team' sets standards for each member.
Why did an organization want to go through a time-consuming process to establish a learning organization? It is an initiative to put organizational learning concepts into practice.
If all available resources are properly utilized within the organization's departments, creativity and ingenuity will become evident.
For this reason, an organization working together to overcome an obstacle may lead to a new creative process to serve customer needs.
Before an organization becomes innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the ongoing methodology by which the institution's approach was utilized to help organizations achieve high performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence regarding the theoretical approach to the investigation of perception. Therefore, it narrows the scope of the research and makes it more accurate.
The relationship between the study of mental illness and behavior helps researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, psychological traumas, wounds, and internal tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to observe and examine brain structures and processes in an unprecedented way.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Despite AI's strong prominence in science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that studies the implementation of behavior, learning, and intelligence in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer inquiries and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become distinct systems, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military sectors; they have also been integrated into many home computers and video game applications.
Field trips are an integral part of any class. Often, the teacher prefers taking her students to places inaccessible by bus.
Technology provides a virtual field trip solution. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquatic environments, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on the journey and to share experiences for future lessons.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their annual trip to the state capital; every year, the website is revised, but older versions remain online as they serve as a reference.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and writing, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Because students are often a very critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve his articles to avoid criticisms.
Furthermore, blogging 'compels students to be more knowledgeable about the world around them.' The need to cater to the audience's interests encourages students to become proficient and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blog writing is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to effectively deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs "strengthens students to become analysts and strong critics; by diligently responding to online educational materials, students can express their stance in relation to others in other writings, as well as express their own views on certain issues (Oravec 2002)."
Ottawa, Canada's charming, bilingual capital, is home to numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, while to the north lies the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more reliably position Ontario as what outsiders consider to be truly Canadian.
In the north, wide, open spaces are rare, and some of them are uninhabitable deserts.
In a population comparison that is surprising to many, there are more African Americans living in America than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
When it comes to wild animals, Madagascar is the largest currently in existence and is a continent in itself.
Most small islands are independent countries or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the land, and it spread widely in Comoro and Mayotte.
With the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape route from Europe to India, European influence and colonization began in the 15th century.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also beneficial (though it shouldn't look too expensive).
Women should consider that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as harassment, and that following, pulling by the hand, etc., is not uncommon.
Be firm in refusing men and do not be afraid to hold your ground (whether cultural differences exist or not, it does not make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and served as a strategic port called Anfa for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Blanca, then abandoned it again after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city, naming it Dar al-Bayda, while it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least enjoyable places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods for sale, such as pottery dishes, earthenware, leather products, shisha pipes, and general trinkets, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located at the eastern tip of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcanic eruption destroyed and buried most of the streets of Goma, particularly the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside Goma must be carefully studied to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu Province.
In addition to offering some of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa, the city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The standard (local) price for a short ride is around 500 Congolese francs.
Coupled with its relative inaccessibility, 'Timbuktu' has come to serve as an archetypal symbol for rare and distant lands.
Even today, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its fame has made it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, due to the threat of desert sands, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS 'Wonders of the African World'.
Due to its more Arab than African character, the city is a complete contrast to the other cities of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered on the east by Mozambique, on the north by Zimbabwe, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km²; it is divided into 14 different eco-zones; each contains diverse wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions, and it is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entry fees for the park.
A person might find it useful to purchase a Wild Card that provides entry options for parks in South Africa, as well as for all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gave its name to the Hong Kong territory, is a place many tourists consider a main attraction.
The array of skyscrapers that form the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glistening bar chart due to Victoria Harbor.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go across to the Kowloon waterfront.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed onto reclaimed land along its northern shore.
This is a place the British colonizers took as their own, and therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial era, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove area, extending 80 km (50 miles) along the coasts of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest located within India's territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps – they include the last remnants of the dense forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², one-third of which is covered by water/marshy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife habitat, and it is currently estimated that there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart all day long from the provincial bus station (across the river), although most of them, especially those traveling to the East and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intra-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese Coaster buses.
Common taxis like Paro (Nu 150) and Panuka (Nu 200) are fast and convenient ways to travel to nearby places.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the entire Oyapock River to connect Brazil's Oiapoque city and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock located in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, while its length is 378 meters, and it has two roads, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not open to the public until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017, at which point the Brazilian customs inspection is expected to be completed.
The Guarani, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture in what is now eastern Paraguay, were a very important indigenous group of the country.
In the Chaco region, other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was previously called 'the vast territory of the Indians,' came into being as a result of the Spanish conquerors clashing with indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the colonial era that lasted three hundred years.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve many indigenous characteristics and identities.
Argentina is very well known for having one of the world's very best polo teams and players.
The year's biggest competition will be held in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here, at other times of the year, small competitions and games can also be seen.
See the Asociación Argentina de Polo for news on competitions and polo games, and where to buy tickets.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is set equal to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British Pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US Dollars are also often accepted.
While British and US currency may be accepted, credit cards might not be in the outer islands; confirm with the proprietors in advance what accepted payment methods are.
It is impossible to exchange Falkland money outside the island; therefore, exchange your money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a semi-tropical zone; in summer, temperatures of +30°C are common.
The winter can be deceptively cold; the temperature sometimes drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons; the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife remains wild, and they should neither be fed nor disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other animals.
However docile they may seem, buffalo, wild boars, deer, bears, and all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors have been injured every year due to not maintaining a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous; therefore, give them space.
Additionally, be aware that scents attract bears and other wild animals; therefore, avoid carrying or preparing odorous foods, and clean your campsite.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is on Upolu Island and has a population of slightly less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital city of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, as seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain remained unwilling to leave the port, it became the scene of a little-known naval standoff.
Except for one English warship, all ships had sunk. Around 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the freedom struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of the Great Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
In Oakland, due to two ports, there are many beaches. The most well-known are found in three locations.
The northern coastal waters (in the North Harbour District) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All are sandy beaches suitable for swimming, many of which are shaded by Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive waterfront amenities are in Central Auckland, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, on Waitematā Harbour.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with various types of shops lining the beach. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', not a complex beer, but enjoyable and satisfying. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of 'flat white' coffee is very distinct. A 'short black' is an 'espresso'; a cappuccino comes piled with cream (not foam); and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but they are very good.
Trips are made into the sea all year round, and incidents that occur due to these reasons originating from within the sea are not uncommon.
Now, heed the advice of the authorities, observe all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur north of 1770 from October to April near seaside resorts and river estuaries. Outside of these times, they may occasionally be found.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live well in the ocean; their main habitat is the Fitzroy River, located in the northern part of Rockhampton.
Pre-registration gives travelers peace of mind, knowing that they have a place to rest after they arrive.
While you might be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campgrounds, through a travel agent, travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast and airport transfer arrangements, or combined flight and hotel packages.
Likewise, if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents (e.g., a visa) for your destination, they can hold the place for you.
However, any modifications or inquiries should be handled by the travel agent, not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, a great many music festival attendees decide to camp on-site, and many participants consider this a valuable part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will have to arrive early to get a place close to the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages ends, there might be festival areas playing music until late into the night.
Some festivals have a special camping area for families with small children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic in winter, ensure the compartment layout, as traveling through ice causes a very agonizing sound for those severely affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include city time. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check terms).
Casinos typically make many efforts to increase the time and money guests spend. Windows and clocks are often absent, and exits can be hard to find.
They generally have special food, drinks, and entertainment provisions to keep guests in good spirits and comfortable at the entrance.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages for free. However, getting drunk impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the benefit of sobriety.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or on mountain passes should consider that there may be snow, ice, or melting temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is low; you cannot drive as you would on bare asphalt.
During severe cold and icy conditions, immobilizing snow can fall very quickly.
Visibility can be obstructed by falling or blowing snow, or by water mist, or by ice on car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries, snowy and icy conditions are common, and traffic mostly continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest draw for tourism in Africa, highlighting it for many visitors.
The word 'Safari' conventionally refers to traveling by land to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, so standard equipment provides good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and one sees them better with the naked eye.
Hiking (referred to as 'bushwalking', 'mountain trekking', or 'traveling on foot') encompasses mountain climbing for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Because it hosted the games in 1964, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games.
If you have booked your 2020 flights and accommodation before the extension was announced, you might be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-related cancellation policies by the end of March will not last until the Olympics, scheduled for July 2020.
While typical tickets cost around ¥7,000, most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000.
Ironing wet clothes helps them to dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if there isn't one in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if a wrinkled sock bothers you, you can use a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (this can cause wrinkling or, in some severe cases, burning).
There are various ways to purify water; some of them are effective for specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others, many minutes are needed.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests unfamiliar to them in their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, worse, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully harm or kill humans, are usually not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase certain goods that are exempt from mandatory taxes in specific areas.
Travelers going to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont; the Buffalo-Pittsburgh expressways, frequently traversing dissected terrain, offer very challenging driving conditions.
If you are unaccustomed to driving on rural roads, maintain your caution: steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits in the preceding and subsequent sections—typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h)—are noticeably lower, and it is far more beneficial to strictly adhere to them than to not comply.
But surprisingly, the mobile service here is stronger, even compared to places where the lines are laid, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweet cakes are excellent, and in Bavaria, they are as rich and diverse as their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are common throughout the year, as apples are baked into pies and strawberries and berries appear in the summer.
Many German baked goods include almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes usually pair exceptionally well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some sweet cakes, however, try to find out what it's called based on the region: Berliner Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, including meat or vegetables.
A dish cooked with spices can be "dry" or "wet" depending on its liquid content.
In the inland areas of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries, while in South India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is mostly used.
Consisting of 17,000 different islands, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that covers a wide variety of regional food types found throughout the country.
But, if used without any other additions, the word refers to the food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Currently widely found in the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes lightly seasoned dishes, and the main flavorings favored by Javanese are peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are a support for the rider's legs that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide the driver with more stability, but there could be safety concerns as the driver's foot might get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from the horse but one leg remains caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged while the horse is running. Many safety precautions must be taken to reduce risk.
First, many riders wear their riding boots that have heels and smooth and narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to come off the saddle when pulled back by a rider who is about to fall.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as 'South America's Slayer,' has many different large granite walls and boulders.
High places feature incredibly stunning views. Climbers from all over the world are creating new routes on an endless wall.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding downwards on snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to one's feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity that has a very large number of enthusiasts, known as 'snow lovers,' who plan their entire vacation seasons around skiing at one destination.
The idea of sliding on snow is very old - illustrations on cave walls depicting snow sliders have been traced back to as early as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational skiing club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Traveling with a ski/snowboard pack: This activity is called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.

Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa individually for Schengen member states, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.

Finland is the best cruising destination. "The Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a boat in archipelagos and on lakes.
