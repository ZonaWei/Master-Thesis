This confirms not only the widespread theory that dinosaurs had feathers, but also details such as color and three-dimensional positioning that fossils cannot provide.
Researchers stated that this animal's plumage is bright brown on top and pale or orange underneath.
The finding provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Given that dinosaur feathers lack a developed shaft called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers claim that the rachis is an earlier evolutionary product compared to these other features.
The structure of the feathers is not for flight, but for temperature regulation or for display. Researchers have stated that while this is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the sample consists of adult feathers, not chicken feathers.
Researchers stated that although this is a baby dinosaur's tail, the sample consists of adult feathers, not chicken feathers.

The work performed was mostly theory-based, although the program was written to simulate observations from the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for is caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon has gravitational pull on Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way has gravitational pull on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The scientists have been able to conclude that the effect dark matter has on other dark matter is just like normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is found in a halo surrounding the galaxy and is composed of many small particles.

Sching of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Group and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience, with voters secluding themselves in a booth and placing a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter drops the ballot into the ballot box and signs the election register.

Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

She has been taken into custody, awaiting charges and evidence, but any eyewitness testimony might not be admissible due to widespread community chatter about her.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently, and courts view publishing photographs as prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University said, "If journalists publish photos and other information about suspects, they appear to be treading a dangerous line."
Aklil's office, the general prosecutor, stated to journalists that it will not comment until there is evidence for the charges.
The document, according to leaked information, refers to the border dispute sought by Palestine, based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered, as reported, include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries and to the Jordan Valley matter.
Israel wants a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after a deal is signed, while the PA, for its part, agrees to such a presence for only five years.
In additional pest control trials, applicators are closely monitored by guards because the trial has been brought under control and its effectiveness has been evaluated.
Through the Sports Shooters Association's hunting program, qualified volunteers were recruited in partnership with NPWS and the Australian Sports Shooters Association (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Protection and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly has been sworn into the new nine-member Transitional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the early release of the CEP as part of a package of measures to take the country to new elections.
The commission was Martili's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests, some of which have been ongoing since 2011, stem from the failure to hold elections.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating and malfunction have been reported; a total of six fires occurred, causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has reported 27 incidents related to the equipment.
Last week, METI stated that Apple had announced 34 additional overheating incidents, which it classified as 'minor'.
The Minister responded by calling Apple's report handling "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck Marina at 07:19 AM local time (Friday 09:19 PM GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damages were reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as Filipino photographers, were released earlier.
The photographers took the old woman's place because she wanted to go to the toilet. Mendoza was killed with a pistol.
Ligins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
They trained as a gynecologist and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Ligins began studying premature labor in his spare time.
His study shows that if a hormone is administered, it accelerates the fetal lung maturity of the infant.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Her fellow fighters also expressed their condolences to Luna.
According to Tommy Dreamer, "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on a two-moon night. Just as unique and beautiful as she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was very crazy like me... maybe more than me... I love her and miss her... We hope she is in a better place."
Before the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic among 1,400 people surveyed had grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled share this view, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming events, who was scheduled for three relays with us at the Commonwealth Games, had his fitness in doubt due to setbacks.
He was unable to take the medications needed to cope with his pain because he was banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematics and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, found the largest prime number until January 25th.
The finding, confirmed by many people using various hardware and software by early February, was made public on Tuesday.
Comets might be a source of Earth's water supply, along with organic substances capable of creating proteins and supporting life.
Because comets collided with Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to understand how planets, especially Earth, were formed.
The 53-year-old Kumo began his rule earlier this year, and last month, legislation to legalize same-sex marriage was signed.
He called the allegations 'political chaos and foolishness'.
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims enables an aircraft to save millions of gallons of fuel annually, reduce carbon emissions, and make shorter trips.
Unlike traditional ground-radar-based technology, air traffic controllers use satellite-based technology to identify aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional journeys are being added, and overground trains do not stop at Wembley; and parking at our park-and-ride facilities is not available on the ground level.
Fears of transport shortages increased the likelihood of the game being forced to take place behind closed doors, without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in *Science* magazine reported the creation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species, formed from interbreeding between the rare Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the common cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris, emerged in just two generations, even though this process was expected to take a much longer time.
Gold can be formed into all kinds of shapes. It can be coiled into tiny designs.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be bent and coiled. It can be hammered flat or rolled.
It is made very thin and attached to another metal. Because it could be made extremely thin, it was used as an embellishment on hand-drawn illustrations in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage extract.
Cabbage juice changes color based on the chemical's acidity or basicity (alkalinity).
The pH level in the tested chemical is indicated by the concentration of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been removed (therefore, hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron).
Sift the two dry powders together, then press them into balls with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands interacts with the outer layers, creating an odd sensation and forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had flush toilets in every house, which were connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of the sewage system have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using satellites.
The satellite in space receives the signal and instantly reflects it back.
The satellite was launched into space by rocket. Because Earth's atmosphere distorts some lights and images, researchers use telescopes in space.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a massive rocket over 100 feet tall is required.
The wheel has remarkably transformed the world. The greatest thing it has done for us is to provide us with incredibly easy and fast transportation.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Under them, there are medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized animals, ranging from rabbits to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat an extremely large number of small animals such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the field concept, a unique job that prevents each cat from competing with one another.
Lions are very social cats that live in large groups called prides.
Lion prides consist of one to three young males, up to thirty females, and cubs.
The women are often very intertwined with each other, many are families of sisters and daughters.
The bite of a lion, like that of wolves or dogs, is very dangerous to animals such as lions (but not other large cats) and to their prey.
The leopard is a well-rounded athlete, capable of climbing (even if not very well), swimming, jumping long distances, and pulling with five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers, like lions, leopards, and jaguars, belong to the same genus (Panthera). Only these four cats can roar.
A tiger's roar is not a full-throated roar like a lion's, but rather more like phrases of noisy and roaring vocalizations.
Ocelots/desert cats like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds. Almost all the animals Ocelots/desert cats hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists have found that ocelots/desert cats locate their prey by sniffing out their scent trail to the places they were on the ground.
They have good night vision and can move well. Ocelots find their prey by blending with their environment.
Small populations, when they move away from their source population (for example, by crossing a mountainous area or a river, or by traveling to a new island from which they cannot easily return), often find themselves in an environment different from their previous one.
This new environment has various resources and diverse competitors. Therefore, the new species requires different traits or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than was previously necessary.
The original species has not changed at all; they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new people begin to adapt to their new environment, their similarity to other peoples diminishes.
Ultimately, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will have diverged so much in appearance that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means creating new species. Creating new species is an inevitable result and an essential part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe, and also absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants prepare their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, and we also make clothes from plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Animals cannot live without plants.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, therefore, it feared nothing except other Mosasauruses.
Its long jaws were armed with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and it had an additional set on the roof of its mouth, which meant there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for certain, but it might have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It would attack anything that went into the water; even a massive dinosaur like a T-Rex was no match for it.
While we are familiar with most of their cuisine, the Romans also had unusual or exotic banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of mouse known as the dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women eat sitting on chairs, the rich like to have a big celebration on the side where they can enjoy themselves as they eat.
Ancient Roman dishes could not have included food items that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or even cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a principal temple for each of their deities, which was considered a house for their gods.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to discern the gods' wishes through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes, unique pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the building was a special sanctuary for his god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't very important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was lived outside the home.
Women cook food in the backyard; shops were open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while traveling westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever his discovery was, the Eskimo tribes were living there at the time.
Even though each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Despite what is written on the back of the document, this is not a wealth map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, early in its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
So, the note might have just been added as an identifier.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles liberated Northern France, but the South had not yet been liberated.
It was administered by the Vichy French. These were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated Southern France and were returning to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by large populations and communities living and working collaboratively.
The word "civilization" derives from "civilis", which means "civil", and is connected to the Latin "civis", which means "citizen". Additionally, "civitas" means "city" or "city-state", which in some way describes the size of a community.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. The culture of civilization signifies the transfer of knowledge across multiple generations, an enduring cultural imprint, and equitable distribution.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving valuable historical evidence and are not recognized as conventional civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially established a weak central government—meaning Congress was their sole body—under the Articles of Confederation.
The council had no power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or court, it often relied on uncooperative state leaders to enforce all its laws.
It also lacked the power to repeal tax laws and tariffs between regions.
Before the articles were approved, they required unanimous consent from all regions, and because the regions did not properly integrate with the central government, their representatives were largely absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the German national team, and they were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
While Italians compete in international games and the Olympics, winter sports are particularly well-known in the northern regions.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to its cluster of islands, Japan is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its foundation in southern Taiwan by instigating changes in the indigenous peoples' grain production practices and by hiring Chinese day laborers to work in its sugar and rice factories.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which then controlled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures known as Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the premises have been rebuilt to help tourists better understand how the area was first settled.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the reconstruction work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is still 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but its aspect ratio has been superseded by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format was actually somewhat confusing, measuring 36mm in width by 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format is said to be 3:2 (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) have aspect ratios that are equal or very close to this one.
The much-criticized and mocked third-party rule, while maintaining a certain standard in its form, is a simple guide for creating flexibility.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see example).
In this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under investigation.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united European states despite their linguistic and cultural differences.
The all-destroying power affects everyone, from top to bottom.
One of the core Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's financial fund is specifically allocated for this reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this accumulation of power and money has caused many to question whether its fundamental guiding beliefs were being compromised.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to blockade the German navy.
Even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries, the strategy has been effective by cutting off essential military and civilian supplies.
Britain mined international waters with bombs to prevent any of its ships from traversing vast water expanses, which was dangerous even for neutral vessels.
Since the tactic had received only a limited response, Germany expected the same for its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the dominant characteristic of many citizens and countries was anti-war and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of war during the First World War, countries wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents, a poetry book, and a letter of appreciation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his former boss).
Ancient China has a unique way of marking its different historical periods; every Chinese stage, or every family that held power, had a clearly identifiable dynasty.
And it was an unstable period of fragmented states, divided between the various dynasties. Among these times, the most notable was the 60-year Era of the Three Kingdoms, which took place between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times, a fierce war took place among many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a bloody period in ancient Chinese history, where thousands fought and died in a struggle to claim the highest seat in the Xian palace.
There are numerous social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from private to public domain, nationalism, and the country belonging to the people rather than a sole ruler.
Furthermore, after the revolution, highly sought-after and successful professions were open to all male applicants.
The same applies to the military, because in the army's ranking system, instead of being based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired the oppressed working-class people in many other countries to start their own rebellion.
Mohammed had a profound interest in matters beyond this mundane life. To meditate, he used to frequent the cave known as Hira on Mount Nur (Light).
The cave itself, having survived the ages, provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Being located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave has been completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, even if you know it exists, it's never easy to find. Once you're inside the cave, it's total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except for the clear, beautiful sky surrounding the many mountains. From inside the cave, only a very small part of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that is still standing to this day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, is one of several large pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, located in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family.
The 'top fold' symbol looks like a V, and the 'bottom fold' symbol looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you must start at the tip and push the bow, while down means you must start from the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upstroke usually produces a soft sound, but the downstroke is stronger and more assertive.
You can pencil in your own markings, but the printed bowing marks are there for musical reasons, so they must be respected.
The very frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by an angry mob of market women.
They returned to Paris, surrounded by many people shouting and making threats against the king and queen.
The rioters forced the King and Queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the mob was brandishing the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
United States imperialism made the Filipino people pay the cost of the war.
On behalf of the Philippine government, they agreed to pay incidental expenses and bond interest through Wall Street banks to U.S. investors.
In fact, the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino population provides fundamental benefits for American imperialism, as it is among its most profitable established ventures.
To understand the Templars, one must grasp the circumstances that inspired the formation of the religious group.
The period during which these events occurred is known as the High Middle Ages in European history: the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages are preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a strong feeling that, in practice, encompasses numerous ideas, tending to believe that a fundamental logic, connected to scientific laws and the manifestation of technology, arises from technology-push or technological necessity and shapes human destiny.
Most definitions of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a largely autonomous path, independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has inherent "effects" on societies, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the motor car inevitably leads to road development.
However, a nationwide road network for small cars is not economically viable, so new manufacturing methods were established to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Owning many cars also leads to a high number of road accidents, which in turn necessitates the development of new techniques for repairing damaged components.
Romanticism had a significant component of cultural commitment derived from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, cultures related to geography and rules that aligned with a community's place were better than arbitrary ones.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was called the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a major center of luxury lasted from around 400 A.D. to 1100 A.D.
In the twelfth century, the situation worsened because Christian warriors, especially, returned with gifts of silk and spices valued far beyond the typical offerings of the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of 'Fashion Capital' was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic architecture flourished between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, the dress heavily influenced Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, lifestyles in the West might lag by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style of dress. Due to the wars, one of the biggest developments of the era was people starting to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Subsistence farming means a farmer produces only enough to sustain himself and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that maximizes yield by using indigenous seeds native to the ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel socially excluded, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Internal cultures can vary depending on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that make a subculture unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a unique and symbolic style that includes fashion, practices, and argot.
One of the most common ways we illustrate the importance of social life is by observing children who grew up in adverse circumstances, facing abuse or hardship, and who consequently did not learn to coexist with their caregivers.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some wild children are confined by people (often their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment is due to the parents' unwillingness to accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Children, before they are abandoned or run away, may have experienced severe child abuse or emotional trauma.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the forest.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child fully exhibits characteristics resembling those of a particular animal (for example, fear or indifference towards human beings).
While it's necessary to make project-based learning easy and interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals who are starting a new learning process, for example, those who are using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Conclusions can be both imaginary and real. In other words, a teacher, much like the assistant that attaches documents in Microsoft Office, is a way of summarizing.
Virtual scaffolds are within the software and are designed for the student to inquire about, explore, and explain procedures that might be challenging for them to grasp independently.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even theft.
No child should grow up in an environment without care, nurturing, or instruction, but they inevitably do.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the homes they came from.
The Internet combines the characteristics of mass communication and interpersonal relationships.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions when considering the uses and gratification approach.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' have been identified as key motivators for internet service (James et al., 1995).
Additionally, 'personal involvement' and 'ongoing connections' were identified as new motivational aspects by Egime and Macord (1998) when they examined audience responses to websites.
Video recording has led to important discoveries in interpreting subtle expressions and facial movements that last for only a few milliseconds.
Especially, it is believed that by accurately interpreting micro-expressions, one can ascertain whether a person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks, in his work 'The President's Speech,' showed how people unable to comprehend speech due to brain damage were able to accurately assess sincerity.
He/She/They pointed out that such abilities to identify human character can also be found in animals like domesticated dogs.
A 20th-century study reveals two pools of genetic variation: recessive and dominant.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the standing pool of variation.
A contentious dynamic of separation and re-integration emerges between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for hominids with a human-like digestive system to meet their amino acid requirements from readily available plant-based food sources.
In addition, the inability to do this has severe consequences: depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources could have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for mammals like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily chewable and provide high amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All things considered, it shouldn't surprise us if our own ancestors to some extent solved their 'protein problem', just as chimps in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of consciously waking up during your regular sleep time and then falling back asleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking up.
If you find yourself readjusting your alarm clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the opposite side of the room to make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking a lot of fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, which forces one to wake up from sleep to urinate.
A person's inner peace is inversely related to the tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive one's life force becomes. Every person has the capacity to find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can access knowledge. The only thing standing in the way is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but is extended by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and an all-encompassing journey of love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the power of awareness) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. Through the contemplation of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and a luminous consciousness is awakened.
During World War II, Germany served as a common enemy, fostering cooperation between the USSR and the USA. Upon the war's conclusion, systemic, procedural, and cultural conflicts led nations to their downfall.
The Cold War began two years before the war ended, as former allies had become enemies.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and the actual war was fought on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, Poland's defense was broken, and the only remaining hope was to retreat and reorganize with the Romanian battle line.
However, these plans failed overnight after 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, and subsequently established Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
The use of ships for transporting goods and for moving large numbers of people and cargo across the ocean is by far the most effective method available.
The traditional role of naval forces is to secure your nation's ability to transport people and goods, while simultaneously impeding your enemy's capacity to do the same.
One notable recent example is the North Atlantic World War II campaign. The Americans were trying to transport people and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop this traffic, primarily using U-boats.
Had the Allied nations collapsed, Germany might have been able to occupy Britain, just as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to expect milk, hair, meat, and hides to be easily provided to them.
Most often, domestic goats have been kept in wandering herds in mountains or other grazing areas, whether young or adult, usually associated with a known shepherd. These herding methods are still in use to this day.
In the early 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Even though the chariots consisted only of parallel planks, they were pulled by horses for greater speed and allowed for the pulling of larger loads than was possible on the somewhat challenging roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced very early on to hold the tracks in place. However, gradually, it was realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had metal on top.
This became a common practice, but iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with metal. In 1767, the first all-metal rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking; people began walking two million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning 'upright man').
The early ones, Australopithecus, did not walk habitually upright.
While evidence of bipedalism was found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the local movement, and we can even become advocates to some extent to reduce future suffering.
This is in many situations like symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, then we must find the root causes of the problems and eradicate them.
It is clearly evident that the world has changed significantly due to human scientific and technological advancements, and problems have been multiplying due to human overpopulation and unsustainable lifestyles.
After its approval by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was taken to a printing house a few rows away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies, now known as 'Dunlop Broadsides,' were produced.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he had his troops in New York read it on July 9. The copy reached London on August 10.
To date, the 25 known major treatises by Dunlop are ancient copies that have survived from the original document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds; they look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with teeth and claws, they lay eggs, and like a T-Rex, they walk on their two hind legs.
Currently, almost all computers are based on data transmission coded in binary numbers.
A binary number has only two values: 0 or 1. These are known as binary numbers – or bits, to use a computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are too general to allow for a quick diagnosis.
The best sign of internal poisoning could be the presence of open medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the document for specific first aid instructions if there are any for that specific poison.
The word 'Tuhuan' is the formal name used by entomologists for a group of insects.
This word comes from an ancient species of bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to living close to humans.
Both biting mosquitoes and bed bugs are parasitic, adapted to their specific habitats and host environments.
Across America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a major neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to contract MS.
Couples can decide that raising children is not what they want, or what their child wants.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, parents terminate their parental rights for another couple to raise their children.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world operates through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides highly scientific research.
But it's not alone; experimenting—an experiment being a test useful for eliminating one or more hypotheses—asking questions, and conducting observations also guide scientific inquiry.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's view is accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge diminished, Westerners found themselves separated from their Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many physiological and behavioral variations are often primarily determined by the presence of natural cycles and their manifestation through biological clocks.
Internally regulated rhythmic patterns, which are not merely responsive to external periodic cues, have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a free-running cycle even without external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading arguments that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
By labeling DNA phage with radioactive phosphorus or protein phage with radioactive sulfur, they conducted two experiments.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected segment of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only modifications made to germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while modifications to other cells will either cause cell death or lead to cancer.
Nature-based tourism provides enjoyment for people interested in visiting natural environments, including flora, fauna, and wildlife.
Examples of activities carried out at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is learning about, visiting, and photographing orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people commute by car from small rural towns to their workplaces, and others whose work destination is a place they left behind are passed by commuters.
In this dynamic transportation landscape, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has destabilized the biosphere from the stable state that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints are sometimes heard equally about water quality and bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, and why do they fail every day? Does this simply mean transport engineers are incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because a driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within a reasonably consistent range; consequently, traffic flows exhibit a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections assist in the planning, design, and operation of road utilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them easily evade predators and efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings by retracting their bodies.
This gives them a wide range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the sun.
While some considered it to be true, the majority, conversely, believed that the solar system, including the sun and other stars, revolved around the Earth.
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It holds 8 times more water than the second largest river.
Additionally, the Amazon is the widest river on Earth, sometimes it is six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small tributary rivers.
Even though pyramid building in stone continued until the very end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza Pyramids were never surpassed in their sheer size and the technical sophistication of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were astonished by their predecessors' monuments, which were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the world's smallest sovereign state and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its statutes and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, as these can all be found in nature and are easy to mine with ancient tools.
The philosopher Aristotle put forth the concept that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements: Earth, Water, Air, and Fire.
This is just like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma; however, it proposed that they transform into new elements to create what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be alloys that include non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
So, when it came out, it was a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a minor role and limited applications.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever needing to approach a recording device.
When new things emerge, one can only wonder what will become of the keyboard.
An atomic bomb operates on the principle of concentrating all its energy by gathering all possible protons and neutrons into the nucleus.
Like a heavy cart rolling down a hill. By splitting the nucleus again, a certain amount of energy is then released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to disintegrate with little or no contact.
The moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The edge is 70 km thick on the near side, and 100 km on the far side.
It is thin in the lowlands and thick in the highlands.
There could be many maria nearby because the crust is thin. It was easy for the lava to rise to the surface.
Current ideas are centered on finding what attracts people.
These concepts suggest that as people grow into adulthood, they have certain needs and/or desires inherent within them.
These concepts indicate what motivates certain people to act as they do, and what causes their environment to behave in specific ways.
Two prominent content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, when administrators begin to lead their former peers, two characteristics can emerge. One common trait is the attempt to remain 'one of the guys' (or girls).
This type of supervisor faces the challenge of making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end, a person transforms into an unknown individual who feels that everything the group was doing should be changed and made their own.
At the end of the day, the leader bears the responsibility for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often causes conflict between leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are held to the same high standards as traditional teams, but they have subtle differences.
Virtual team members serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical teams.
More than typical team members, they are largely self-managing, and therefore they connect across various time zones in ways their local managers cannot comprehend.
The existence of a true "covert group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The 'Invisible Team' is a management team where every member reports. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member.
Why did an organization choose to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? It is an innovative goal to put organizational learning concepts into practice.
If all available resources are effectively utilized within an organization's departments, innovation and ingenuity will become prominent.
For this reason, an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization becomes innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous methodology through which the institution's approach has been used to help organizations achieve high performance.
Neurobiological data provides empirical evidence regarding the theoretical approach to the investigation of perception, thereby narrowing the scope of the research and making it more precise.
The relationship between the study of mental illness and behavior helps researchers in their studies.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, emotional trauma, lesions, and internal tumors affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to observe and examine brain structures and processes in unprecedented ways.
This provides us with a lot of data and resources to build simulation models that help us understand processes within our minds.
Although AI has a strong presence in science fiction, it is a very important part of computer science that studies enabling behavior, learning, and intelligence in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer inquiries and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become distinct systems, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now predominantly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military sectors; they are also integrated into many home computer and video game applications.
Field trips are an integral part of any class. Often, the teacher prefers to take her students to places inaccessible by bus.
Technology offers solutions through virtual field trips. Students can observe museum artifacts, visit aquatic environments, or appreciate beautiful artworks while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on the journey and share experiences for future lessons.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their annual trip to the state capital. The website is updated every year, but older versions remain online because they serve as reference.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with flawed grammar and writing, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog writer begins to diligently improve their posts to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to have more knowledge about the world around them." The need to cater to audience interest encourages students to be smart and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blog writing is a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to significantly enhance their learning beyond the regular school day.
The proper use of blogs, 'strengthens students to become analysts and strong critics; by diligently responding to online learning materials, students can express their positions in other texts in comparison to those of others, as well as articulate their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravek 2002).'
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and it is home to many art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south lies Niagara Falls, while to the north lie Muskoka and beyond, untouched natural beauty.
All these things and more reliably position Ontario as what outsiders perceive to be truly Canadian.
In the north, vast, open spaces are rare, and some are uninhabitable wildernesses.
To the surprise of many, African Americans living in the U.S. outnumber the entire population of Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
When it comes to wild animals, Madagascar is the largest of all existing places and a continent unto itself.
Most small islands are independent countries or are associated with France, and they are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the region, and it became very widespread in Comoros and Mayotte.
Because the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India, European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Female travelers are advised to state they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Even wearing a ring is beneficial (though it shouldn't look too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as harassment, and that being followed, pulled by hand, etc., is not uncommon.
Be firm in saying no to men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca, founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, served as a strategic port called Anfa for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casablanca, and after an earthquake in 1755, they abandoned it again.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city, naming it Daru El Badya, but it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trade posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least enjoyable places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find traditional Moroccan goods like clay plates, pottery, leather products, shisha pipes, and general geegaws being sold, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located at the eastern tip of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcanic eruption destroyed and buried most of Goma's streets, particularly the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside of Goma should be studied to understand the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
In addition to being one of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa, the city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to go to Goma. The standard (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
Coupled with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a byword for distant and rare lands.
Still today, Timbuktu remains a poor city, even though its fame makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, due to the threat of desert sands, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS 'Wonders of the African World'.
As it has more of an Arab than African character, the city is a complete contrast to the other cities in the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordered on the east by Mozambique, on the north by Zimbabwe, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct eco-zones, each home to a variety of wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions, and it is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It might be beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which offers admission to parks, including all South African National Parks, in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island, which gave its name to the Hong Kong territory, is a major attraction for many tourists.
The array of skyscrapers that form the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a dazzling bar chart due to Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along its northern shore.
This is a place the English colonizers claimed as their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sunderbans are the world's largest mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) along the coasts of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is known as Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps – they also include the last remnants of the fearsome forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which one-third is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife habitat, and currently, it is estimated that approximately 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer live in the area.
Buses depart all day from the provincial bus station (across the river), although most of them, especially those heading east and to Jacar/Bumtan, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since local buses are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by comfortable and robust small Japanese Coaster buses.
Shared taxis, like those to Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200), are fast and convenient ways to travel to nearby places.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the entire Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, located in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, and the structure is 378 meters long, featuring two 3.50-meter-wide roadways.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not open to the public until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational by September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs inspection is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were a very important indigenous group of the country, living in what is now Eastern Paraguay as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
In the Chaco region, other indigenous tribes such as the Guaykuru and Payagua survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as “the vast territory of the Indians,” emerged as a result of the Spanish conquistadors' encounter with indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the three-hundred-year colonial period.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain many indigenous characteristics and identities.
Argentina is very well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The year's biggest competition will take place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Small competitions and games can also be observed here at other times of the year.
For news on competitions and polo games, and where to buy tickets, check the Association Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is set equal to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands in Stanley, beyond the FIC West store.
British Pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
British and US currency may be accepted, but credit cards might not be on the outer islands; confirm what accepted payment methods are with the owners in advance.
You cannot exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands; therefore, exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; in summer, temperatures of +30°C are common.
The winter can be deceptively cold; while temperatures only occasionally dip below freezing, the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons; the amount of rainfall remains more or less the same throughout the year.
While most animals in the park are accustomed to human presence, wildlife is still wildlife, and they should not be fed or disturbed.
As per park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other animals.
No matter how docile they may seem, buffalo, warthogs, deer, bears, and all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year for failing to maintain an appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous; so give them space.
Additionally, know that smells attract bears and other wild animals; therefore, avoid carrying and preparing strong-smelling foods, and clean your campsite.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is on Upolu Island and has a population of slightly less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port became the site of a largely unknown naval standoff when seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain refused to leave.
Except for one British warship, all ships had sunk. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
A peaceful gathering in the city during the freedom struggle organized by the Mau Movement resulted in the assassination of the Great Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Oakland has many beaches due to its two ports. The most well-known ones are located in three places.
The northern shores (in the North Shore District) are on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All of them are sandy beaches, suitable for swimming, and many offer shelter from Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive's waterfront attractions are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent Central Auckland suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers.
These are family beaches with various types of shops lining the shoreline, which can sometimes get crowded. Swimming is safe.
The main domestic beer is 'Number One'; it's not a complex beer, but it's enjoyable and satisfying. Another domestic beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to choose from, but New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is very different. A 'short black' is espresso, cappuccino comes piled with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but they are very good.
Sea voyages are conducted year-round, and the damages resulting from sea-related causes are minimal.
Continue to heed the advice of authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur north of 1770 from October to April near coastal recreational areas and river mouths. Outside of these times, they may occasionally be found.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not truly live in the ocean; their primary habitat is the estuarine rivers in the northern part of Rockhampton.
Pre-registration gives travelers peace of mind because they know they have a place to stay after they arrive.
Although you might find other lodging types like campgrounds available to book through a travel agent, travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your spot if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents (e.g., a visa) for your destination.
However, any changes or inquiries should be handled by the travel agent, not directly by the hotel.
For some festivals, most of the music festival attendees decide to stay on site, and many participants consider this a valuable part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to arrive early to get a spot near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages ends, there might be other parts of the festival still playing music until late into the night.
Some festivals have a separate camping area for families with small children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic in winter, confirm the cabin arrangement, as traveling through the ice causes a very disturbing sound for those who are sensitive.
Saint Petersburg cruises include city time. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check terms).
Casinos typically make significant efforts to maximize the time and money guests spend. Windows and clocks are often absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They largely provide special food, beverages, and entertainment to ensure guests remain in good spirits and comfortable upon arrival.
Some places offer free drinks. But, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the advantage of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider that there could be ice, snow, or freezing temperatures.
On snowy and snow-falling roads, traction is low; you cannot drive as you would on bare asphalt.
Heavy snow that can immobilize you can fall very quickly during extremely cold and snowy conditions.
Visibility can be obstructed by falling or blowing snow, water mist, or ice on car windshields.
On the other hand, in many countries, snowy and icy conditions are common, and traffic mostly continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most significant draw for African tourism, showcasing it to many visitors.
The word 'safari' commonly refers to overland travel to observe the beautiful African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, so standard equipment provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes elusive and are better seen with binoculars.
Hiking (also known as 'bushwalking,' 'mountain trekking,' or 'walking on foot') involves climbing mountains for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will also take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Because it hosted the games in 1964, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodation before the extension was announced, you might be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most of the coronavirus-based cancellation policies in effect by the end of March will not last until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
While typical tickets go for around ¥7,000, most event tickets are expected to range from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if a creased sock bothers you, you can use a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (it can cause wrinkling or, in some severe cases, burning).
There are different ways to purify water; some are effective for specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, you should consider purchasing bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they are unfamiliar with in their native areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can violently harm or kill people, are often not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase certain goods that are exempt from mandatory taxes in specific locations.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmount; the Buffalo-Pittsburgh expressways, repeatedly traversing rugged terrain, present very challenging driving conditions.
Maintain your caution if you are not used to driving on rural roads: steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits in the preceding and succeeding sections — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — are noticeably lower, and it is far more advantageous to strictly obey them than to disregard them.
But surprisingly, the mobile service here is stronger than in other places where lines are laid, for example, even stronger than in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweet cakes are very good, and in Bavaria, like their southern neighbor, Austria, they are rich and diverse.
With apples being baked into pies throughout the year, and strawberries and berries appearing in the summer, fruit pies are common.
Many German baked goods include almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are typically wonderfully paired with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some sweet cakes, but try to find out what they're called depending on the region: Berliner Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, served with meat or vegetables.
Spiced, sautéed dishes can be 'dry' or 'wet,' depending on their liquid content.
In the inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is traditionally used in curries, while in South India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With its 17,000 diverse islands, Indonesian cuisine is a general term encompassing a wide range of regional dishes found throughout the country.
But, if used without any other suffixes, the word refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Currently widespread across the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features simply seasoned dishes, and its main flavorings, beloved by Javanese, include peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are footrests for the rider's legs that hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer the driver greater stability, but they could pose safety risks if the driver's foot gets stuck.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but one foot remains caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged as the horse runs. To minimize the risk of accidents, many safety precautions must be taken.
Initially, many riders wear their riding boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to release from the saddle when pulled backward by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the 'South American Killer,' boasts numerous large granite walls and boulders.
The heights offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are creating new routes amidst an endless wall.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourism activity with many enthusiasts, known as "snow lovers," who plan their entire holiday seasons around skiing in one location.
The idea of sliding on snow is very old—drawings on cave walls depicting snow sliders date back to 5000 BC!
As a sport, downhill skiing dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski-backpacking: This activity is called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or snow mountaineering.
While often associated with Alpine-style ski touring or mountain trekking, these are not included; the latter are performed in narrow terrain and require very rigid, long skis, whether made of wood or plastic, and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a similar mountain climbing route.
In good conditions, you might cover a somewhat greater distance than walking - but without a heavy bag, on a groomed path, you can frequently achieve cross-country ski speed.
Europe, in contrast, though a small continent, has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling between different countries means going through extensive visa applications and passport controls.
In this regard, however, the Schengen Zone operates as a single country.
Within this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport controllers and checkpoints.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa separately for Schengen member countries, so you save time, money, and paperwork.
There is no international definition for what types of products are considered heritage. Some tax organizations classify goods older than 100 years as heritage.
The interpretation is, there are geographical differences in places like North America, where the life expectancy is shorter than in Europe.
Handicraft products, though they may be newer than their mass-produced counterparts, can be described as ancient.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is beneficial to many, including other professions.

Severe weather is a general term for dangerous weather conditions that cause any damage, major social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere on Earth, and it has many types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Just like thunderstorms, hurricanes, waterspouts, and cyclones, high winds, hail, torrential downpours, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, hail storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be cautious of any hazards that may affect their vicinity, as severe weather conditions can impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
Searching online for "dangerous area education" might provide a local company's address.
The curriculum systematically covers all the topics outlined here in extensive detail, predominantly through practical experience.
The training will typically be 2-5 days and includes role-playing, extensive first aid, and sometimes military training.
Books and magazines about surviving the wilderness are common, but very few texts address war zones.
Travelers arriving at the airport who have planned gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry the correct travel documents.
Governments vary in their willingness to issue updated documents to accommodate passports with an unspecified gender (X) or with a desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents likewise varies widely.
Screenings at security checkpoints have become very intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Individuals undergoing pre-surgical gender transition should not be expected to undergo examinations where their privacy and dignity are supposedly protected.
Rip currents are return flows of water in response to incoming waves from the shore, often near reefs or similar structures.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in the shallower sections, and a fast current leading to deep water can form there.

Immediately upon stepping out of their position, retreating is no harder than usual.
Try to seek again from an uncompromised position, or you can expect salvation based on your abilities and your presence.
Reverse culture shock precedes culture shock (whose honeymoon phase is short), lasts for a long time, and can be more severe.
Travelers who had an easy time adapting to a new culture may sometimes find it particularly difficult to re-adapt to their original culture.
After living abroad, when you return home, you've become accustomed to the new culture and lost some of your home's traditions.
Initially, when travelers went abroad, perhaps they were patient and understanding because they knew they had to adapt to the conditions of the new country.
People also don't understand that patience and understanding are essential for travelers returning to their home country.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most popular things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can silently observe them before the show begins.

The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, contains the Vinson Massif, which holds Antarctica's largest mountains, including Mount Vinson at 4892m.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be your only option.
Because you need to be outside in a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a satellite phone call, it is not, overall, a replacement for a mobile phone.
The service is frequently used in transportation, including trips that require recreational hands-on interaction, remote data, and voice communication.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide additional information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a vacation, an increasingly popular option is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among gap year students, as it allows them to take a year before university without disrupting their studies.

Finland is a premier cruise destination. Known as the “Land of a Thousand Lakes,” it also has thousands of islands within its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
On archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a boat.
The bordering archipelago of islands and the large lakes, while large enough for any ship, offer a unique experience, particularly with smaller boats or even just a small one.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, and a single boat holds seven or eight people.
This is common in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it's very unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, the number is one to forty).
Most of the special Baltic ships will have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means they can visit the historic city for a couple of full days, returning to sleep on the ship each night.
If you're only going to the coast on short boat trips, you don't need a special visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not on the coast, and the city tour is not included in the cruise price.
Especially if they have never flown on an airplane before or have experienced a traumatic event, traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and from diverse backgrounds.

If you send goods by air freight, it can take several days to pass through the unloading process and customs in some cases.
The only way to expedite it was to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations do not allow unaccompanied baggage, and this is when you are needed.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a lot of money for that privilege, or rather, have your company do it for you.
However, this won't come cheap: simply put, for business class, they could pay up to four times the standard economy fare, and for first class, up to eleven times!
In general, looking for discounts on business or first class seats for direct flights from A to B is pointless.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of flyers willing to pay high dollars for the privilege of reaching a destination quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital city of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, a region with its own government and currency but unrecognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political agreements, economic relations have been re-established between those two parts of Moldova.
In Moldova, the main religion is Orthodox Christianity.

Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found there along with many common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are expected to wear skirts that cover their knees and must also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially brightly colored ones, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are also expected to wear trousers that cover their knees.
This can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but that garment is not washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable when wearing these garments. One size fits all men!
