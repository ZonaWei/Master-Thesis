While one experimental vaccine seems to reduce deaths from Ebola, to date, no drugs have been definitively shown to be effective in treating existing infections.
One antibody drug, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but official studies showed it had less benefit than expected in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, Zmapp was used as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics accepts the letter from the US Olympic Committee and accepts the Olympic family's fundamental need to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We concur with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, would be best served by moving forward with meaningful changes within our organization, rather than revoking certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation which will hopefully explain how abuse of the magnitude as bravely described by Larry Nassar's survivors could go undetected for so long, and embraces necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have one goal — to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.
Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as his advisor and also for the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say this animal's fur was reddish-brown on the upper side and pale or carotene-colored on the underside.
That discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers concluded that the rachis is perhaps a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flight but rather for thermoregulation or display. Researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not the soft downy feathers of a hatchling.
Researchers suggested that, even if this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample shows adult-sized feathers and not juvenile feathers.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the fluid flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less magnetically active stars become.

The work performed was primarily theoretical, but a program was developed to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was seeking would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way impart energy into the fluid of the Sagittarius sign.
Scientists were able to conclude that black grouse affects another black grouse in the same usual way.
This theory states that much of the dark matter surrounding the galaxy is near the galaxy in a type of halo, and is made up of many small particles.

In France, traditionally, voting has been a low-tech experience: voters retreat to a booth, then place a pre-printed ballot paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter deposits the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter register.
The French electoral law instead codifies that matter. Strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are added except those belonging to registered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following a specific procedure.

The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were rescuing the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He/She was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering his son.
He is in custody, awaiting charges and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may be severely compromised because his picture has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law operates differently, and the courts have viewed the publication of the images as discriminatory.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says "journalists appear to put themselves at risk by publishing images, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which oversees prosecutions, has indicated to reporters that no further comments will be made at least until charges are laid.
The document, according to rumors, will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding continued military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to withdraw that presence for only five years.
Those undertaking the additional attempt to control pests were to be supervised by guards, as the attempt would be monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were enrolled under the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, these four designated marksmen for the first shooting operation received full training and safety instructions.
Martelly swore in the new nine-member provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests which began in October.
The protests, which are sometimes violent, were triggered by the lack of elections, with the next one having been overdue since 2011.
About 60 incidents of faulty iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burn injuries.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to those devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them about 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company said "were not serious."
The Ministry responded by calling the postponement of the report by Apple "very regrettable."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said that no damage was reported in the nation.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there was no sign of a Tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has kidnapped Hong Kong tourists by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several captives have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later replaced the old woman because she needed to relieve herself. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and joined the medical profession.
She learned to be a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate preterm labor in his spare time.
His/Her research showed that if a hormone were used, it would increase the rate of growth of the child's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found the 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
His fellow boxers also mourned Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away two months to the night. Unique, just as she was. A strong woman.”
Justin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was as fragile as I was … maybe even more so … love her and you’ll miss her … hopefully she’s in a better place.”
Among 1,400 people polled prior to the 2010 federal election, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view, calling for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
In a plurality, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had been scheduled to swim in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness has been in doubt.
He/She could not take the drugs needed to relieve his/her pain because they are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Missouri, discovered the largest prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software by early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were the source of delivering water to Earth, along with carbon-containing elements that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He/She referred to the rumor as "rantings and political foolishness".
He considered running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration claims would allow planes to use shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel every year and cut carbon emissions.
It utilizes satellite-based technology as opposed to traditional ground-based radar to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport is being provided, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available there.
The fear of a lack of transport sparked the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was believed to take much longer, due to interbreeding between Darwin's native finches, Geospiza fortis, and immigrant large cactus finches, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be formed into various shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be spun and woven. It can be hammered flat or rolled to make a sheet.
It can be made thinner, and affixed to other metals. It can be made so thin that at times it was used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations called 'illuminated manuscripts'.
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH value is determined by the concentration of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons were stripped (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Combine the two dry powders, then, with clean, moist hands, form them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which you will feel becoming distinct and forming a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a modern toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a complex sewage system.
Remnants of a sewage system have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women mingled together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use satellites.
A satellite in space receives a call and then reflects it back down, almost instantly.
A satellite was launched into space by rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of the light and our view.
You don't need a large rocket over 100 feet tall to place satellites or telescopes in space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is to provide us with easy and fast transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transport.
Below it are more medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that eat abundant small prey, such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a specialized role that each cat holds and that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are some of the most social felines, and they live in large groups called prides.
Lion prides are made up of one to three related adult males, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
Women usually relate very closely to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave like wolf packs or dogs, animals which surprisingly are similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also dangerous to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump very far, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The leopard is in the same group (genus Panthera) with the lion, jaguar, and the leopard of South and Central America. Only these four cats can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's mighty roar, but is more like a scolding sentence delivered with loud words.
Wild cats like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds when they can. Almost all the animals that wild cats hunt are smaller than them.
Scientists believe that wild cats track and find prey by scent, sniffing to locate them on the ground.
They possess excellent night vision and move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the larger population they originated from (e.g., if they cross mountains or a river, or move to a foreign island such that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in different environments than where they were before.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or practices to be stronger competitors than what they previously needed.
The original number has never changed, they still need the very same methods as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to appear more and more different from the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, those two populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide which humans exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was a large predator of that time, so it did not fear anything except other Mosasaurs.
Its massive jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set on the roof of its mouth, meaning that anything that encountered it could not escape.
We don't truly know, but it might have had a split tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps it might have been a cannibalistic creature.
It would also attack anything that entered the water; even a large dinosaur like T. rex wouldn't stand a chance against it.
While much of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had their share of surprising or unusual banquet items, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of mouse called dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and a woman ate their food sitting on chairs, rich people preferred to have feasts together where they would recline on their side while eating.
Ancient Roman meals would not have included foods that entered Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of that god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to attend to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each palace had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special tower-shaped pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temple.
The upper part was the sacred dwelling of God.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house was not very important.
Much of the Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; stalls were just open counters that faced the street. Stones were used to build roads.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was sold at an exorbitant price.
Greenland had few people. Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further West, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences among the people, kings, traditions, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Behind the Declaration of Independence, the words “Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776” were written. These words are on the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was folded for preservation.
So, it is possible that the quote was added as a sign.
The landing on the day of the attack and the fighting that followed had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied Forces attacked Southern France, the attack was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were advancing towards Germany.
Civilization is a unifying culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *civilis*, which means civic, related to the Latin *civis*, which means citizen, and *civitas*, which means city or city-state, and which in some way describes the scale of society.
City-states precede nations. Civilization signifies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, an enduring cultural presence, and equitable distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and without being recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government – with the U.S. Congress being its only branch – under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and, since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce its laws.
Nor did it have the authority to disregard inter-state laws and tariffs.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, field hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the North, where Italians compete in international and Olympic games.
Japan owns nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), thus making Japan the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Because of the groups of islands Japan possesses, it is often referred to, from a geographical standpoint, as an "archipelago."
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when passing English sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, introducing changes in grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Windows.
Many houses on the edges of these complexes were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35 millimeters, which was the dominant film size in the classic cinema era.
It is still produced to this day, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The dimension ratio of this design (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is then said to be 3:2.
Many common structures (the APS family of structures, for example) are equal to or approximately equal to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates visual impact while maintaining a degree of order in the image.
It says that the point of greatest impact for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into vertical and diagonal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which was rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound the states of Europe together despite their different languages and traditions. I
Its widespread power affected everyone from the king to the common person.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's financial assets are there specifically for that reason.
The church's central authority was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money in one place led many to question if this ideology was being upheld.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy was effective, cutting off essential military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated international law, which is generally accepted and codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire parts of the sea, thereby posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was little response to this tactic, Germany expected similar reactions to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing view of many citizens and nations was one of conciliation and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of war during the First World War, nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to accept a job at Edison’s company in New York City.
He arrived in America with only 4 pennies, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different periods of time; each stage of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty, there was an unstable period of fragmented states. The most famous among these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms of Han and Jin.
During these periods, fierce wars took place among the nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest era in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest throne in the palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from a dictatorial regime to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to its people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, thus allowing the ambitious and the successful to thrive.
Similarly for soldiers, because instead of military power depending on class, it now depends on merit.
The French Revolution also stimulated many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was greatly drawn to matters beyond this mundane life. He would frequently visit a cave that became known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived through time, provides a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the world.
Truly, it's never easy to find, even if one knew it existed. Once you enter the cave, you are completely isolated.
Nothing else can be seen except the clean and beautiful sky above and the many mountains surrounding it. Very little of this world can be seen or heard inside this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE is one of the largest structures built in honor of the departed Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the main pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The 'upper bracket' symbol looks like a V and the 'lower bracket' symbol looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (the part where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The up-bow usually produces a soft sound, while the down-bow is more powerful and stable.
Feel free to make your own pencil markings, but remember that the printed slurs are there for musical reasons, and should therefore be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the King's sister Madame Elizabeth, terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women on October 6, 1789.
In a horse-drawn carriage, they traveled towards Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people who loudly jeered and hurled threats at the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their car windows.
At one point, a member of the mob waved the head of a slain royal guard at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The military costs of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Undoubtedly, the great profits resulting from the long-term oppression of the Filipino people constituted the core income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templar, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period when the events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th Centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention end around 1500.
Technicism is a term that encompasses various perspectives in practice, ranging from technological determinism to the belief that human destiny is guided by an underlying logic tied to scientific laws and their technological manifestations.
Many interpretations of technological determinism involve two general views: that technological development itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has 'effects' on societies that are inherent, rather than social.
For example, one might say that cars lead to road development.
However, the national road system is not economically viable for only a few vehicles, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to many road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in medical treatment for repairing broken bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determination influenced by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the Roman context, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and traditions related to geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the societal conditions, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of aristocratic Europe.
It is known for being a center of luxury, which began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its condition deteriorated during the twelfth century, especially because the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were more valuable than those offered by Byzantine markets.
It was at this time when the transfer of the fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was influenced by Byzantine cultures from the East.
However, due to limited means of communication, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of that time, as a result of the crusades, was that people started to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is done for the production of just enough food to sustain the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, often organic, that uses preserved and native seeds for the respective area, along with crop rotation or simple alternative methods to improve yields.
Historically, many farmers engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
A subculture brings together like-minded people who feel marginalized by societal norms and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that make a subculture unique might be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, geographical, or a combination of elements.
Members of subcultures often signify their membership through unique styles which include fashion, behavior, and language.
One of the popular methods used to show the importance of social interaction is to use a few poignant examples of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not engaged by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "feral" or violent. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in other cases, this abandonment of children was due to parents refusing to accept a severe mental or physical disability in the child.
Perhaps isolated children experienced severe abuse or trauma in their childhood before being released or escaping.
Others are accused of bestiality; others are said to be living alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child displays behaviors (within physical limits) almost identical to those of the specific animal that nurtured it, such as its fear or wildness towards humans.
While project-based learning should make education easier and more interesting, fellowship goes a step further.
Training methods are not a study method, but a service that offers assistance to people who are going through new learning situations, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Platforms can be abstract and also concrete, in other words, a teacher is a type of platform but so is the paper clip character in Microsoft Office.
Online platforms are integrated into the program for the purpose of questioning, encouraging, and explaining processes that might have been a significant challenge for the student to handle independently.
Children are placed in Foster Care for many other reasons, ranging from abandonment to abuse and even abduction.
No child should grow up in an environment that doesn't educate, nurture, or teach, but they do.
We assume the Foster Care System to be a safe space for these children.
Children's homes should provide safe accommodation, loving caregivers, a sound education, and a reliable healthcare system.
Children's homes should provide all these needs that were lacking from their original homes.
The network blends elements of group and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to further measurements regarding usage and optimal methods.
For example, "learning" and "collaboration" are suggested as important drivers for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and 'enduring relationships' were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational elements when they examined audience response on websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-sounds and facial movements that last only a few tiny seconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by accurately interpreting subtle signs.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, showed how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess truth accurately.
He even suggests that such an ability to interpret human behavior can be shared by animals like domesticated dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: recessive and expressed.
Variations increase morphological differences, and selection eliminates them from the pool of expressed variations.
Alternating patterns of blending, separation, and re-mixing back and forth between those two pools for each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for large mammals with human-like digestive systems to meet their amino acid needs from the available vegetation.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
Easily accessible plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for higher mammals like us to digest unless cooked.
In comparison, animal foods (termites, ants, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide high-quality proteins that contain essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way as savanna baboons do today.
Sleep interruption is a process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be done by using an alarm clock that isn't too loud to bring you to awareness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself snoozing your alarm, it can be placed on the other side of the room, to force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other chronobiological options involve heavy drinking (especially of water or tea, a popular remedy) before bed, a situation that compels one to wake up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely related to the level of stress within their body and soul.
The less the external pull, the more positive the inherent life forces are. Everyone has the ability to find greater peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can attain understanding. One thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded upon by the Mahayana path of compassion and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It involves Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, the repetition of words or sounds, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan thought is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and transformative consciousness is awakened.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to the separation of the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was meant to last for the next 40 years and would indeed be fought by proxy forces, in theaters of war from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup via the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian borders after invading the eastern territories of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The large-scale transport of goods by ship was the most effective way to transport masses of people and a lot of cargo by sea.
The work of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country has the ability to transport its people and goods, while at the same time, preventing your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most famous recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
Meanwhile, German forces, using submarines, were trying to obstruct this traffic.
If the Union had failed, perhaps Germany could have defeated Britain just as it had conquered Europe.
It appears goats began to be domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Generally, domestic goats began to be kept in roaming herds in mountainous or other grazing areas, supervised by guardians who were often children or young teenagers, much like typical shepherds. These herding methods are still used even today.
Horse-drawn carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were laid with parallel logs, they enabled horses to pull wagons faster and to haul fairly substantial loads on the poor roads of the day.
Sleepers were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place. However, as time went on, it was discovered that those rails would perform better if a piece of metal were laid on top.
This became a custom, but the iron caused damage to the wooden wheels of the carts.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking; humans began to walk upright two million years ago, after the emergence of upright humans.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright normally.
Bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked bipedally approximately seven million years ago.
We can start living as good friends of the environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can even become activists to reduce future hardship to some extent.
This is akin to treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't just want a short-term solution, then we must get to the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed dramatically due to human advancements in science and technology, and problems have escalated because of overpopulation and humanity's wasteful lifestyles.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, which are now known as “The Dunlop Handbills”.
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 known Dunlap broadsides are the oldest extant copies of the document. The original handwritten manuscript does not exist.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on processing information that is encoded in binary.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits, in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medication or poisonous household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for that poison.
The word 'bug' is used by entomologists in the formal sense for this group of insects.
This word stems from a long-standing familiarity with bedbugs, which are highly skilled at parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs have experience living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Across all of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young adults and middle-aged adults.
Multiple Sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple might decide it is not in their best interest, or their child's best interest, to raise the child.
These couples can choose to create a child custody plan for their child.
In taking guardianship, birth parents terminate their parental rights so that other parents can raise that child.
The main goal of Science is to determine how the world is governed by scientific principles. Indeed, this approach guides much scientific research.
However, it is not alone; experiments – and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or two possible theories – asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, and especially, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters were accepted, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific origins.
Many followed patterns in physiology and behavior that often depend on the presence of endogenous rhythms and their generation through biological clocks.
Regular rhythms, which are not merely a response to recurring external signals, have been recorded in many living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals,
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will maintain a period of self-sustained oscillation even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the proposals that DNA was the hereditary material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to label the viral DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the viral protein with radioactive sulfur.
Changes can have different effects depending on the type of change, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germline mutations can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the enjoyment of the scenery, as well as the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking pictures, and learning about great apes in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns by car, heading to work and passing others who are commuting to the places they just left.
In this robust transportation system, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, the private-car-dependent model.
Science now indicates that this huge carbon economy has shifted the Earth's biosphere from one of its stable states that was meant to sustain human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems evoke such complaints, why do they fail every day? Is it that transport engineers are incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave with a certain consistency; consequently, traffic congestion exhibits some stability and can be accurately represented statistically.
To accurately represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established among three main parameters: (1) flow, (2) density, (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of intelligent road systems.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them easily evade enemies and easily find food and mates.
Many insects are fortunate to be able to fold their wings against their bodies.
This provides them with ample small hiding places from their enemy.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System orbited the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, along with the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't appear to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the sea comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were astonished by the towers of their predecessors, which were at that time already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent nation in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also an everyday language used by many of those who work in the government, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from ancient times, since all of these can be discovered naturally in their original form and are easy to extract using ancient tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, proposed the idea that everything is made from a combination of one or more of four elements. These elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was like four states of matter (in that same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new things to create what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like Calcium and Potassium are often considered metals. In fact, there are other metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is composed of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so much so that many trillions could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
So that pencil was a true friend to many people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerge, the pencil is diminished in status and its usage declines.
People now are writing messages on computer screens, without ever needing to use a pencil sharpener.
One might ask what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
This fission bomb operates on the principle that energy is required for the formation of nuclei with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the atom again, and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to break apart even with a slight touch.
The moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is known as the crust.
The Earth's surface has a width of about 70 kilometers up close and 100 kilometers from a distance.
Under the ocean it is thin but thick under the plateaus.
There might be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easy for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories aim to discover what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are deeply rooted as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they do, and what factors in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two tendencies can emerge when supervisors begin to lead their former peers. On the one hand, they will try to identify themselves as “one of the guys” (or women).
This type of manager tends to have difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes unrecognizable, feeling that they must change everything the team has been doing and make it their own.
After all, it is the leader who is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often causes divisions between leaders and the entire team.
Standard teams are held to the same quality standards as their regular counterparts, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a communication hub for their current physical group.
They often have more freedom than regular team members, since their teams can meet across differing time zones, and this can be difficult for their management to oversee.
The presence of a true 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is a unique characteristic of virtual teams.
The 'unseen team' is a management team to which every member reports. The unseen team sets standards for every member.
Why should an organization go through a long process to establish a learning organization? One goal of implementing the concepts of a learning organization in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in an organization's high-performing departments, innovation and expertise can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process for serving customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must establish an innovative culture, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Chain method as a way to help organizations achieve a high level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical perspective on cognitive studies. Therefore, it narrows the area of research and makes it more specific.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies enables us to see and examine brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and resources to build models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often associated with scientific literature, AI forms a crucial part of the computer science field, addressing the behavior, learning, and cognitive adaptation of machines.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, organizing and coordinating, the ability to respond to customer identification and queries, as well as text, voice, and facial recognition.
Such matters have become distinct disciplines, seeking to provide solutions for life's problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering, and military, as they are built into several home computer programs and video games.
School field trips are a big part of any class. Often, the teacher likes to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology provides solutions through virtual field trips. Students can view replicas in museums, visit aquariums, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing together in a virtual field trip is also a good way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future travelers.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the State Capitol; every year the website is updated, but old versions remain online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also enhance student writing. As students begin their blogging experience with grammatical and spelling difficulties, the presence of an overall audience changes that.
Since students are the most important audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to be aware of the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's interest encourages students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to broaden their reading beyond the normal school day.
The appropriate use of blogs “can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively engaging with online resources, students can identify their positions within the context of others' texts as well as express their own perspectives on specific issues” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is an attractive and bilingual Canadian city, and is home to a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present history.
Further to the south are Niagara Falls and to the north is the unspoiled beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All this and much more portrays Ontario as inherently Canadian to outsiders.
Vast areas in the far north are sparsely populated, with some of them being uninhabited wilderness.
For a surprising population comparison: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a self-contained continent, when it comes to wildlife.
Many of the small islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as coastal resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the regions, and it greatly affected Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that any female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also important to wear a ring (and not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, have their hand grabbed, etc.
Be firm in telling people no, and don't be afraid to stick to your stance (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it right!).
The present city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but they abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Near the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hooks, and a whole range of geegaws, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered much of the city's streets, especially downtown.
While Goma is largely safe, any trips outside of Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for the easiest ways to track Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual fare for locals is 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Despite its relative inaccessibility, 'Timbuktu' has come to be used as a metaphor for very distant foreign lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast with other cities in the country, because it has more Arab prominence than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's attractions and is considered paramount among the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all National Parks in Southern Africa, there are daily conservation and entry fees.
It may be beneficial for one to purchase a Park Card, which provides entry to some South African parks or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name and is where many tourists focus their attention.
The array of buildings that forms the Hong Kong skyline is aligned with an appealing bar chart, which was perhaps shaped by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To get a better view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This is where the English colonists took as their own, and therefore if you are looking for colonial-era evidence of the area, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove forests, extending 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and the Indian subcontinent.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Those forests are not merely mangrove swamps; they include some of the last remaining primeval forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which one third is covered by water/swamp.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife park, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 deer in that area.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, although many, especially those heading east and to Jakar / Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets several days in advance.
Many districts are served by Japanese Coastal minibuses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby areas, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, span 378 meters, and have two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant group that inhabited what is now called Eastern Paraguay, living as nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "Giant of the Province of the Indies," was born following confrontations between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asuncion's founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest match of the year will take place in December at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Tournaments and minor matches can also be seen from here at other times of the year.
For information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is estimated to be equal to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
Generally, British Pounds will be accepted anywhere in the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US Dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards may not be accepted, though British and American currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out what payment method is acceptable.
It's impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when the Northern Hemisphere is cold, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30ºC are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature very rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no defined 'wet' or 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the wild are used to seeing humans, they are wild animals nonetheless, and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park management, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
Regardless of how calm they appear, bison, elk, hartebeest, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they failed to maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has fewer than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a famous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except one British ship. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peace meeting in the town led to the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, owing to the sprawling and irregular layout of Auckland and its two harbors. The most famous are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Nearly all beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and many of them are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale areas of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches that are sometimes crowded, featuring a range of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main beer in the area is ‘Number One’, it’s not a complex beer, but it’s good and refreshing. The other local beer is called ‘Manta’.
Many types of French wine are available, but New Zealand and Australian wine can travel better.
Tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of 'white' coffee is foreign. A short black is an espresso, a cappuccino comes with more cream (not foam), and tea is prepared without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the rock are made year-round, and injuries from any cause during these trips on the rock are rare.
Still, take advice from authorities, obey all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Sea caterpillars appear near the coast and near river mouths from October to April in the north of 1770. Sometimes they may be found outside these times.
Sharks are present, although it is rare for them to attack humans. Many sharks fear humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live extensively in the sea, as their primary habitats are river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives the traveler peace of mind that they will find a place to sleep upon arrival.
Travel agencies often have special hotel offers, though you might also be able to book other types of accommodation, like campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer package deals which include breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also put a hold on it for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other destination documents (e.g., visa).
Any amendments or requests must be processed through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, a large number of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, with many considering it an essential part of the experience.
If you wanted to be close to the action, you would need to get up early to secure a spot near the music.
Keep in mind that even when the music on the main stage finishes, there may be other areas of the festival that will continue to play music until midnight.
Several festivals have special areas for camping for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin area, as passing through the snow causes an unpleasant noise for those most susceptible.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. These passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the money and time spent by gamblers. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and the exit is difficult to find.
They often feature unique food, drinks, and entertainment options to entertain and accommodate guests in their premises.
Some venues offer in-house alcohol. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone driving in elevated areas or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare pavement.
During heavy snowfall, enough snow to get you stuck can fall in a short amount of time.
Visibility can also be reduced by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snowy and icy environments are common in many countries, and transport continues all year round without disruption.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest draw for tourists in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari means to travel to see amazing African wild animals, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to move close to vehicles, and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
Hiking (also known as "bushwalking", "trekking", or "walking") involves ascending, whether for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will begin on August 24 and run until September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at various venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have ever hosted two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the games in 1964.
If you reserved your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, many coronavirus cancellation policies did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between Yen 2,500 and Yen 130,000, with standard tickets costing approximately Yen 7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards for rent, even if one is not staying in a room there.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if it is available.
Be careful the cloth is not too hot (as it can make you jump, or in the worst case, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some being successful against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is enough, elsewhere several minutes will be needed.
Filters differ in their performance, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a completely sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter insects and animals they do not recognize from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause nuisance, or in severe cases cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Organisms that are themselves infectious, or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill people, usually do not qualify as pets.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy tax and duty-free goods in certain areas.
Travelers in high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on goods like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Pike, frequently passing through secluded wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are plentiful.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those in preceding and succeeding sections — typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour) — and strict adherence to them is more critical than otherwise.
Surprisingly, however, mobile phone service is very strong here, stronger than in other network areas like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bread is excellent, and in Bavaria, it is even better and distinct, similar to that of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with apple pies available year-round, and cherries and plums appearing in summer.
Many German baked goods often contain almonds and nuts. Popular cakes often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small, yet excellent, doughnuts, try what, depending on the region, is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a food made from herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be 'dry' or 'wet' depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland areas of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in spiced gravies; in Southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is widely used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses a wide variety of cuisines found throughout the country.
But, when used without further qualifiers, the term tends to refer to food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The most common food found across large areas of the archipelago is Javanese cuisine, simply prepared, with its basic flavor consisting of peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar) and various fragrant spices.
Stirrups are supports that hold the rider's feet, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider great stability, but can be a safety concern because of the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck inside them.
If a rider is thrown from the horse but their leg gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse bolts. To reduce this risk, several safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, many riders wear a tall boot with a soft, extremely thin sole.
Furthermore, other saddles, especially English saddles, have safety stirrups which allow the leathers to fall away from the saddle if pulled backward by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley – a major rock-climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its various large granite and rock walls.
The expeditions feature thrilling landscapes from the peaks. Mountain climbers from all over the world continue to establish new routes, exploring the potential of its walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards fastened to your feet.
Skiing is a major activity with many participants, who are often known as "ski bums," planning their entire vacation around skiing in a particular area.
The idea of snowboarding is very old - cave drawings show snowboarders from as far back as 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing began at least in the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski Backpacking: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski trekking.
It relates to but usually does not involve high-mountain skiing tours or mountaineering, the latter of which is done on a steep slope and requires a board and hard boots.
Consider a ski slope as an analogous climbing path.
In ideal conditions, you'll be able to cover a significant distance compared to walking – but it's very rare to achieve gliding speeds in rural areas without a heavy backpack on pre-existing trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Normally, traveling through many countries would mean having to apply for visas and undergo passport control many times.
The Schengen Area, however, functions somewhat like one country in this regard.
You'd better stay in this area; you can cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member country individually, thereby saving time, money, and documents.
There is no general definition of which manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some customs organizations define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit can be shorter in areas like North America than in Europe.
Art products can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Arctic reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important for many who have other professions.
However, traditionally, not all Sami have engaged in extensive reindeer herding; instead, they subsisted on fishing, hunting, and the like, and primarily kept reindeer as working animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although widely used, particularly among non-Romani people, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani people.
If the country you visit is subject to travel advisories, your health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance might be affected.
You might also want to consult government advice rather than your own, but their advice is tailored for their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East might experience different situations from Europeans and Arabs.
The advisory is merely a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The opinions presented are often quick, generalized, and greatly simplified when compared to the in-depth information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a common term for any dangerous weather condition and has the potential to cause damage, significant social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and its many forms can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, drought, and wildfires are manifestations and effects of extreme weather, as well as storms, hurricanes, waterspouts, and tornadoes.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include severe snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any adverse weather affecting their area, as it could affect any travel plans.
Anyone who plans to visit a country that is considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search for ‘Hostile Environment Course’ on the Internet might yield the address of a local company.
Typically, the course will cover all the issues discussed here in depth, often with hands-on experience.
Typically, the course will take 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, extensive first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines discussing life in the wild are common, but publications relating to war zones are scarce.
Travelers intending to go abroad for gender reassignment surgery must ensure they carry valid documents for their return journey.
The readiness of governments to issue gender-neutral (X) passports or updated documents to match one's chosen name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies as well.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Faggots should not expect to pass through the screen of scrutiny and come out of it with their dignity and secrets intact.
Rip currents are those that flow back from the waves breaking and receding from the shore, typically at a rocky outcrop or similar location.
Because of the underwater topology, what returns tends to concentrate in a few deep areas, and high-speed waves in deep water can form there.
Many deaths occur due to the exhaustion of trying to swim against the waves, a situation which can be difficult.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skill or if you've been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock comes quicker than culture shock (sometimes even during the honeymoon period), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who had an easy time adapting to a new culture sometimes have a difficult time readjusting to their own culture.
When returning home after living abroad, you have become accustomed to a new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a foreign country need to adjust.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also important for travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most enjoyable things in the children's area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
You would normally hear the voices of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set as background and narrator of a long story.
Events are shown on the pyramid and different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have many bases, including sixteen that were active in 2020.
The islands are located 120 kilometers north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island, which has the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception, where a flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a unique natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here meet this plain, then rise again to form the 360-kilometer Ellsworth Mountains range, separated by the Minnesota ice streams.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, contains Antarctica's highest mountains, such as Vinson Massif, which reaches a height of 4,892 meters at Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without mobile phone signals, a satellite phone might be your only option.
Satellite phones are not generally an alternative to mobile phones, as you must be outdoors and have a line of sight to satellites to make a call.
Services are frequently used in transportation, including luxury vehicles, as well as for journeys requiring long-distance data and voice.
Your mobile service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular choice for those planning a gap year is to travel and study.
This is especially popular among school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before entering university, without affecting their studies.
In most cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can certainly improve your chances of pursuing higher education in your country.
Normally there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great place for boating. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
For archipelagos and islands, you don't necessarily need a ship.
Although coastal islands and larger lakes are actually large enough for any boat, small boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is an international sport in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is consistent with Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is completely different (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic trips include long stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several days, returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only visit the coast by cruise ship, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin and Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and a trip to this city is not included in the price of the cruises.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never traveled by plane before or have experienced a distressing event.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's not so different from the personal fear and aversion that many people have.
For others, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear which is based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Transportation companies are well-paid for delivering items quickly. Often, time is of the essence for business documents, goods, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
In some ways, large companies have their own planes, but otherwise, for smaller companies, there were difficulties.
If they were to send items by air freight, in some instances it could take several days to complete offloading and customs.
The only way to get it through quickly was to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations do not allow sending luggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to travel in first or business class is to pay a lot of money for that opportunity (or, even better, have your company pay for it).
However, this does not come cheaply: due to poorly defined laws, you can expect to pay up to four times the regular economy fare for a business class ticket, and 11 times for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no need to even look for business class discounts or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain niche of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of reaching their destination quickly and comfortably, and they are adapting accordingly.
The capital city of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic nation that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, these conflicts led to the creation and self-proclamation of the State of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any United Nations member state.
Economic links have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a major transport hub.
The former ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, built around a major hub and surrounded by mountains.
Wide streets, glass-fronted buildings, and modern commercial centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city itself has a more European than traditional Turkish atmosphere.
The village of Haldarsvik has a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and an unusually shaped octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are impressive marble sculptures of doves on the grave.
It's worth half an hour to stroll around that charming village.
To the north and easily accessible, there is a charming and romantic city, made famous by visitors after describing its glittering adornments as recorded by Lord Byron.
The Skotabu 403 bus travels frequently to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also, to the north, visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a world-renowned Marian shrine.
Please remember that you are specifically visiting a place with a mass grave, and also a place that holds unfathomable meaning for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who spent their time here, and many others whose loved ones were killed or worked to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat that place with all dignity, decorum, and the respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the website by marking or cropping graphics on the templates.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of them prefer to speak Catalan, a large number understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, many signs are displayed in Catalan because it is legally designated as the primary official language.
Spanish is still widely used in public transport and other areas.
Regular announcements on the Metro are only made in Italian, but unscheduled disruptions are announced via automated systems using various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-absorbed, arrogant, and proud.
While this is often just a misguided notion, a good way to get along in Paris is still to be on your best behavior, to act like someone who is “bien e’lev’e” (well-raised). It will make getting along much easier.
The Parisians' seemingly abrupt exterior will quickly melt away if you show some basic respect.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has dense forests, especially beeches, firs, and spruces, and a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has diverse types of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and European quail can be found there, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are expected to wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Many monasteries provide kangas for women who come without one, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly colored one, you will get a smile from a monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover their knees.
This can also be requested from the stock at the gate, but those clothes are not washed after every user, so you might not feel comfortable when wearing those skirts. One size fits all for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of other parts of the Mediterranean region, is made with bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and always uses olive oil.
A simple dinner, especially during the summer, is often Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and other available ingredients such as cheese and tuna.
All nouns, including the formal 'You' (Sie), always begin with a capital letter, even mid-sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and things.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat difficult due to the need to know whether a verb or adjective is used for emphasis.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy as many words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
Key letters to note are c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: 'caro' means 'dear', while 'carro' means 'cart'.
Persian has relatively simple grammar, and is often regular.
Therefore, reading this grammar source will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand better.
Needless to say, if you know the language of love, it will be easy for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people with a little knowledge of Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is very similar and does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern investigations are usually not employed today, and remain as museum pieces or for educational purposes.
For light pollution in their time was not a problem as it is today, they are often in cities or at universities, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Many modern research telescopes are key instruments in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the preferred flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the advisory circle surrounding the Imperial Court.
Plants look best when in their natural environment, so avoid the temptation to remove even just "one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formal garden, collecting “specimens” will also get you removed, without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to be and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
But due to its placement in the “upper tropics” just a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to contend with intense heat (constantly) and intense sun (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also a few buses heading north of Hebron, the site of the traditional tombs of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you intend to board goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a beautiful setting for a holiday.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or cruising along the picturesque Danube or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also outline popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians worldwide.
There is a custom of keeping vigil on Easter night in certain open areas to see the sun rise.
Indeed, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may also be a pre-Christian Spring and Fertility ritual.
More traditional churches usually hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with the faithful celebrating at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All native animals that reached these islands perhaps came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to complete the journey, thereby making the giant tortoise the primary herbivore in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic and Antarctic regions during winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora light, as the sky will be somewhat dark day and night.
Since those areas are not densely populated, and little pollution is usually not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more systematic and formal than Western practices.
Suits are standard business attire, and employees address their colleagues by their last names or professional titles.
Harmony in the workplace is important, emphasizing group efforts instead of praising individual achievements.
Often, employees obtain approval from their supervisors for any decisions they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' orders without question.
