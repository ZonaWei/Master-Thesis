This confirms not only the widespread concept that dinosaurs had feathers, but also details that fossils cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The plumage of this animal is dark brown on top and light or orange underneath, researchers said.
The finding provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a developed shaft called a rachis, yet possess other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers say that the rachis is an older evolutionary result than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers is not for flight, but for temperature control or display. Researchers stated that although this is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the sample is a collection of adult feathers, not a chicken's.

They have found that the basic principle by which the Sun operates is similar to the principle by which other stars operate: it has been found that the movement of all stars within the system is governed by reflection, their rotation, and nothing else.
They used the luminosity and rotation in conjunction with the plasma flow to determine the star's plasma-flow-related Rossby number.
The smaller the Rossby number, the star's activity decreases with respect to magnetic reversal.

Although the work performed was largely theoretically supported, the program was written to simulate observations from the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for is caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon has gravitational pull on Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way has gravitational pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that the effect dark matter has on other dark matter is just like regular matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is located in a halo around the galaxy and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience, with voters isolating themselves in a booth and placing a pre-printed paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter drops the ballot into the ballot box and signs the election roster.

Candidates can send representatives to observe each part of the process. In the evening, votes will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following certain procedures.

Even though three people were in the house when the car crashed, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained a severe head injury.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extricated the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoiya has since been charged at Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her child.
She is in custody, awaiting charges and evidence, but any eyewitness testimony may not be admissible because she has been widely talked about in the community.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and courts view publishing photographs as prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University said, "Journalists seem to be treading a dangerous line if they publish photos and other information about suspects."
The Office of the Crown, the general prosecutor, has stated that it will not comment to journalists until there is prosecutorial evidence.
The document, according to the leaked information, refers to the border dispute Palestine seeks based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other covered topics, as reported, include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries and to the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel wants a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed, while the PA, for its part, agrees to such a presence for only five years.
In additional pest control trials, applicators will be closely monitored by supervisors since the trial was controlled and its effectiveness evaluated.
Through the Sports Shooters Association's hunting program, in partnership with NPWS and the Australian Sports Skaters Association (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Protection and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial culling operation received a comprehensive safety and training brief.
Martelly has been sworn into the new nine-member Transitional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the early dismissal of the CEP as part of a package of measures to take the country to the new election.
The commission was Martelly's response to the extensive anti-regime protests that started in October.
The occasionally violent protests stem from the failure to hold elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
Approximately 60 iPod overheating and malfunction cases have been reported; in total, six fires have occurred, causing four people to suffer minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it identified 27 incidents related to its equipment.
Last week, METI revealed that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents it referred to as "non-severe."
The Minister responded by calling Apple's report handling "truly pathetic."
The earthquake hit Marina at 07:19 AM local time (Friday 09:19 PM GMT).
The Northern Marianas Office of Emergency Management said there were no reported casualties in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer had been holding Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far, at least six deaths have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as Filipino photographers, were released earlier.
The photographers took the old woman's spot because she wanted to go to the toilet. Mendoza was killed with a gun.
Ligins followed in his father's footsteps and joined the medical profession.
After training as an obstetrician, they began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying preterm labor in his free time.
As his study shows, if a hormone is administered, it accelerates the baby's fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Her fellow fighters also expressed their condolences to Luna.
According to Tommy Dreamer, “Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on a two-moon night. Uniquely beautiful, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was very crazy like me... maybe more than me... I love her and I miss her... We hope she is in a better place."
Among 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that Queen Elizabeth II believed Australia should become a republic at the end of her reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming competition was involved in three of our relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his injuries, his fitness was in doubt.
Because he was banned from the games, he was unable to take the medications required to manage his pain.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has found the largest prime number as of January 25th.
Many people, using various hardware and software, confirmed the discovery by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could perhaps be a source of Earth's water supply, along with organic substances that can create proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly how Earth was formed.
The 53-year-old Kumo began his rule earlier this year, and last month, a law to legalize same-sex marriage was signed.
He referred to the allegations, calling them 'political uproar and foolishness'.
It is expected that they will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is the system that the FAA announces allows an aircraft to save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions annually by making shorter trips.
Unlike previous ground-radar-based technology, air traffic controllers use satellite-based technology to identify aircraft with high accuracy and to provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional services are being added, and overground trains do not stop at Wembley; furthermore, on-site car parking is not available at our park-and-ride facilities.
Fears of transportation shortages increased the likelihood that the match would be forced to be held behind closed doors, without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in a science magazine reported the creation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species was formed in just two generations due to hybridization between the rare Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortis) and the cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris), even though it had been estimated that this process would take a longer time.
Gold can be formed into all types of shapes. It can be coiled into small forms.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be bent and coiled. It can be hammered flat or rolled smooth.
It is made very thin and attached to another metal. Due to its ability to be made very thin, it was used for decoration on hand-drawn illustrations in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts."
This is called a chemical's pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage liquid.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the chemical's acidity or alkalinity.
The pH level in the tested chemical is indicated by the concentration of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which their electrons have been removed (therefore, hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron).
Sift the two dry powders together, then press them into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands rubs against the outer layers, which creates a peculiar sensation and forms a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had flush toilets in every house, connected by an advanced drainage system.
The remains of the sewage system were found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mixed together.
When you call someone who lives thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives its call and instantly reflects it back.
The satellite was sent to space by rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere alters some lights and images.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a massive rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel has changed the world dramatically. The greatest thing the wheel did for us is that it provided us with very easy and fast transportation.
He has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Under them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats that eat a great number of small animals, such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds (including stray domestic cats).
The secret to their success is the field concept, a unique work that ensures each cat does not compete with the others.
Lions are very social cats that live in large groups called prides.
Lion prides consist of one to three young males, up to thirty females, and cubs.
The females are often very related to each other, many are families of sisters and daughters.
Cases of rabies in lions, like in wolves or dogs, are very dangerous for animals like lions (but not other large cats) and for their prey.
The tiger is a powerfully built athlete, capable of climbing (though not very well), swimming, jumping long distances, and pulling with five times the strength of a strong human.
A tiger is in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (Genus Panthera). Only these four cats can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not a full-throated roar like a lion's, but rather a sequence of growls and loud calls.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds. Almost all the animals Ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists find that ocelots/desert cats track their prey by sniffing and exhaling at the spot where the animals had been on the ground.
They can see well with night vision, and they can also move well. Ocelots find prey by blending in with their environment.
Small living things (small populations) that came from a main population (for example, if they cross a mountainous area, or a river, or travel to a new island from which they cannot easily return), often find themselves in an environment different from their previous one.
This new environment has various resources and competitors, so the new species requires various traits or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than it previously needed.
The original species has never changed; they still require the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, its resemblance to other peoples will decrease.
In the end, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will have diverged so much in appearance that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the creation of new species. The creation of new species is an inevitable outcome and an essential component of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe, and also absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is, what is exhaled).
Plants prepare their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants, and we also make clothes from plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its era, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with over 70 razor-sharp teeth and had an additional set on the roof of its mouth, which means there is no escape for anything that passes its way.
We don't know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he might have even eaten his own kind.
It would attack anything that entered the water, and even a giant dinosaur like a T. Rex could not be its match.
Although we know most of their food, the Romans had strange or unusual feast dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of mouse called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women eat their food sitting on chairs, the rich like to hold a big feast where they can socialize on the side while eating their meal.
Ancient Roman diets could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or even cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered a house for the gods.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to attend to the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes, uniquely pyramid-shaped towers, called Ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the wall was a special sanctuary for his god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not very essential.
Most of Hebrew family life was spent outdoors.
Women cook food in the backyard. Shops were open market stalls that faced the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling westward, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever his discovery, the Eskimo tribes lived there at the time.
Even though each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Despite what is written on the back of the document, this is not a treasure map.
The words written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were “Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776”. The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, early in its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, the note might have been added only as a tag.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated Northern France, however the South had still not been liberated.
It was administered by the "Vichy" French. These were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated Southern France and were returning to Germany.
Civilization is a common culture shared by a society of large populations living and working cooperatively.
The word 'civilization' comes from 'civilis', meaning 'civil'. It is connected to the Latin 'civis', which means 'citizen'. Additionally, 'civitas' means 'city' or 'city-state', which in some way describes the size of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. The culture of civilization signifies the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a lasting cultural legacy, and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often vanish without leaving valuable historical evidence and are not recognized as conventional civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially established a weak central government—meaning Congress was the sole body—under the Articles of Confederation.
The council had no authority to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it often relied on uncooperative state leaders to enforce all its laws.
It also did not have the power to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
Before the articles can be approved, they require joint approval from all regions, and because the regions did not properly engage with the central government, their representatives were largely absent.
The Italian national football team is the most successful team in the world, second only to the German national team, and they were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
While Italians compete in international games and the Olympics, winter sports are most popular in the northern regions.
Japan comprises around 7,000 islands (the largest of which is called Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to its collection of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical terms.
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its foundation in southern Taiwan by instigating changes in the indigenous people's crop production practices and by employing Chinese day laborers to work in its sugar and rice factories.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, surrendering sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which controlled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings within the compound have been rebuilt to give tourists a better understanding of how they originally arrived.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the reconstruction work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but its aspect ratio has been superseded by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format was actually somewhat confusing, measuring 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest overall numerical ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) have an aspect ratio that is either equal or very close to this.
The much-maligned and ridiculed Rule of Thirds is a simple guideline to create dynamism while maintaining a certain level in the image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into three (see example).
In this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united European states, despite language and cultural differences.
Its all-destructive power affects everyone, from the greatest to the smallest.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's financial fund is specifically allocated for this reason.
The Church's central authority has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this accumulation of power and wealth has led many to question whether its fundamental guiding belief is being lived up to.
Shortly after the war broke out, Britain began blockading the German navy.
Even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which was codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries, the strategy proved effective by cutting off essential military and civilian supplies.
To prevent any British ship from passing through vast stretches of water, international waters were mined, which posed a danger even to neutral vessels.
Since the tactic only yielded a limited response, Germany anticipated a similar outcome from the unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing sentiment among many citizens and nations was anti-war and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of war during the First World War, countries wanted to prevent such a situation from recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to accept a job at Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents, a poetry book, and a thank-you letter from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different periods of time; each Chinese era, or each family that was in power, had a clearly distinct dynasty.
And it was an unstable period, with territories divided among the various dynasties. The most notable of these periods was the Era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times, a fierce war was waged among many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a bloody period in ancient Chinese history, where thousands of people fought and died struggling to sit on the highest seat in the Xian Palace.
There are numerous social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from traditional rule to populism, nationalism, and the country belonging to the people instead of a single sole ruler.
Also, after the revolution, highly sought-after professions that enabled them to be successful were open to all male applicants.
It was the same for the military as well, because in the army's ranking system, instead of being based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired the oppressed working class in many other countries to start their own rebellion.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this ordinary life. To meditate, he used to go to the cave known as 'Hira' on Mount 'Nur' (Light).
The cave itself, a survivor of its era, provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Its location atop one of the mountains north of Mecca has made the cave completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, even if you know something exists, it's never easy to find. Once you enter the cave, it's complete isolation.
Except for the clear, beautiful sky around the many mountains, nothing is visible. From inside the cave, only a very small part of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands to this day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BCE, is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The "Giza Plateau" or "Giza Necropolis", located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains numerous pyramids (including the Great Pyramid, which is the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the small pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family.
The 'upper fold' symbol looks like a V, and the 'lower fold' symbol looks like a staple wire or a square missing its bottom part.
Upwards means starting at the tip and pushing the bow, while downwards means you should start from the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The up-stroke usually produces a soft sound, but the down-stroke is stronger and more assertive.
You can mark your own score with a pencil, but the printed bowing marks are placed for musical reasons and must therefore be respected.
The extremely frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister Madame Élisabeth were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by a mob of angry market women.
They returned to Paris, surrounded by many people shouting and making threats against the king and queen.
The people gathered for an uprising forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the mob was waving the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the startled queen.
United States imperialism paid the cost of the war to the Filipino people.
On behalf of the Philippine government, they agreed to pay outstanding expenses and bond interest through Wall Street banks to U.S. purchasing power.
Indeed, the most profitable established entities, through the extended exploitation of the Filipino people, generate fundamental benefits for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the religious group.
The period when these events occurred is known as the High Middle Ages in European history, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages are preceded by the Early Middle Ages and are followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
A strong feeling that inclines one to believe that technological determinism, which in practice encompasses numerous ideas, originates from a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and the manifestation of technology, shifting from a technology-driven impetus or technological necessity towards the destiny of humanity.
Most definitions of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a largely independent course beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, for its part, has 'effects' on societies that are inherent, rather than being merely a product of social conditions.
For example, it can be said that the motor car inevitably leads to road development.
However, a national road network for small cars is not economically viable, so new manufacturing methods have been established to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Owning many cars also leads to a high number of road accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques for repairing damaged parts.
Romanticism had a significant component of cultural commitment that originated from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and later, cultures associated with geography, were superior to establishing arbitrary rules that conformed to society's position.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was called the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a major center of luxury lasted from 400 A.D. until 1100 A.D.
In the twelfth century, the situation declined primarily because Christian crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, that were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of 'fashion capital' was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style originated between the 10th and 11th centuries and peaked in the 14th century.
Initially, the dress had a significant influence on Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication methods, lifestyles in the West can lag 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style of dress. Due to the wars, one of the biggest developments of the time was that people started to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming means when a farmer has produce that can only benefit himself and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system practiced by utilizing seeds native to the ecosystem and combining them with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel excluded by societal standards, enabling them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may vary depending on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that make a subculture unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a mixture of these factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through a unique and symbolic style that includes fashion, customs, and argot.
One of the most common ways we explain the importance of social life is by observing children who grew up in difficult conditions, abuse, or hardship, and who did not learn to live with their caregivers.
Children like these are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (often their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment is because their parents did not accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Abandoned children might have experienced severe child abuse or emotional trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the forest.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors entirely like those of a distinct animal (for example, fear or indifference towards human beings).
While project-based learning is necessary to make learning easy and interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that assists individuals embarking on a new learning process, for example, those using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Summaries can be both imaginary and real. In other words, an instructor is a way of summarizing, just like the little assistant who attaches documents in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are located within the software and are intended to prompt the student to inquire about, explore, and explain procedures that might be challenging for them to grasp independently.
Due to various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even theft, children are placed in foster care.
No child should grow up in an environment that lacks care, is unsupportive, and uneducational, but they will inevitably grow up.
We see the foster care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is expected to provide all the necessary things that were lacking in the home they were previously taken from.
The Internet combines the characteristics of mass and interpersonal communication.
Regarding the uses and gratifications approach, the unique characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been identified as critical motivators for internet service (James et al., 1995).
Furthermore, "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience responses to websites.
Video recording has led to important discoveries in interpreting subtle expressions and facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
Especially, it is believed that by accurately interpreting micro-expressions, one can ascertain whether someone is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay titled 'The President's Speech,' indicated how people unable to understand speech due to brain damage were able to accurately assess sincerity.
He/She mentioned that such abilities to recognize human traits can also be shared by animals, such as domesticated dogs.
A study conducted in the twentieth century shows that genetic variation has two pools: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the available pool of variation.
The controversial difference of separation and reunification with each generation between the two pools.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with a human-like digestive system to meet their amino acid requirements from the plant-based food sources available there.
Additionally, the inability to do this has severe consequences: depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources could have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are hard for mammals like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily chewable and provide high amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All things considered, it shouldn't surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in some way, just as chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of consciously waking up during your regular sleep time and falling back asleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily accomplished by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed across the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, which forces one to wake up to urinate.
A person's inner peace is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life energy becomes. Every person has the potential to find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can acquire knowledge. The only thing standing in the way is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but is extended by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and an all-encompassing journey of love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (power of awareness) is activated through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan Meditation Center is Divine Yoga. Through the inspiration of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and a consciousness of enlightened wisdom is created.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, fostering cooperation between the USSR and the USA. When the war ended, systemic, procedural, and cultural conflicts led the countries to their downfall.
Two years before the war ended, the Cold War began because former allies were now enemies.
It would last for the next 40 years, and the actual fighting took place on battlefields from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other locations.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was broken, and the only hope that remained was to retreat and regroup with the Romanian battle line.
However, these plans failed overnight after 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, invaded Poland's eastern regions, entered, and formed Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships to transport goods, and to carry many people and goods across the ocean, is the most effective method of all those available so far.
The traditional role of naval forces is to ensure your country's ability to transport people and goods is maintained, while simultaneously disrupting your enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
A notable recent example is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic primarily using U-boats.
Had the Allied nations fallen, Germany, having occupied the entire rest of Europe, might have been able to capture Britain as well.
It appears that goats were first domesticated 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to expect that milk, fur, meat, and hides would be easily given to them.
Usually, domestic goats have been kept in wandering herds in mountains or other grazing areas, and often, young or adult goats are as recognizable as their known shepherd. These husbandry methods are used to this day.
In the early 16th century, Wagenweighs was built in England.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel planks, they enabled the horses pulling them to achieve greater speed and to haul larger loads than on the day's somewhat difficult roads.
To keep the tracks in place, cross-ties were introduced quite early on. But gradually it was realized that tracks would be more effective if they were made of metal.
This became a common practice, but iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known transportation was walking, and people began walking two million years ago, associated with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning 'upright man').
The early Australopithecus did not walk upright as a habit.
Although evidence of bipedalism was found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, Sahelanthropus might have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become advocates to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is like treating the symptoms in many situations. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is evident that the world has changed significantly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have been increasing due to human population growth and an overly consumptive lifestyle.
After its acceptance by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then taken to the printing house a few blocks away.
All night long, between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides," were produced.
The document's first public reading by John Nixon was in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
The first was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. The copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 known Dunlop Broadways to date are ancient copies that have survived from the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds; they look like dinosaurs.
They have teeth, claws, and legs, they lay eggs, and like a T-Rex, they walk on their two hind legs.
Currently, almost all computers are based on data transmission coded in binary numbers.
A binary number has only one or two possible values; that is, 0 or 1. And these numbers are known as binary numbers - or bits, to use computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are too general for a rapid diagnosis.
The best sign of internal poisoning could be the presence of an open medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the text if there are specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The word 'bug' is the formal name used by entomologists for an insect group.
This word comes from ancient species of bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to live closely with humans.
Both biting mosquitoes and bed bugs are parasitic, adapted to live on their hosts or in their parasitic habitats.
Throughout America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has confirmed that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
Couples can decide that raising a child is not their desire, or not in their child's best interest.
This couple might choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the children.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method truly guides a lot of scientific research.
But it's not alone; experimenting, and an experiment which is a test used to rule out one or more hypotheses, asking questions, and also conducting observations guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and particularly on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's view is accepted in all scientific fields, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the Western world found itself separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often primarily determined by the existence of natural cycles and the productivity of biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that do not easily respond to external periodic cues have been recorded for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a free-running cycle even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the central arguments that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments by labeling phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutation, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells, can have various different effects.
Only modifications made to germline cells can be passed on to children, whereas modifications made to other cells either cause the cell to die or lead to cancer.
Nature-based tourism entertains people interested in visiting natural environments, including plants, animals, and wildlife.
Examples of activities carried out on the site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to learn about, visit, and photograph orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small rural towns to their workplaces, while others, whose work destination is the very place they left, are passed by them.
In this dynamic transport landscape, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has destabilized the biosphere from the stable conditions that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, one sometimes hears as many complaints about water quality as about bridge collapses. 
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Does this simply mean transport engineers are incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles and their interaction between two points.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it is impossible to predict a driver's behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows will have a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them easily evade enemies and efficiently find food and a mate.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings by turning their bodies backward.
This gives them a wide range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus said the solar system revolves around the sun.
While some people considered it to be true, many people, on the contrary, believed that the celestial bodies, including the sun and other stars, moved around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river on Earth, sometimes becoming six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small tributaries.
Even though stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza Pyramids were never surpassed in their size and technical construction scale.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by their predecessors' monuments, which were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the world's smallest sovereign state and the least populous country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its constitution and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they can all be found in nature and are easy to mine with ancient tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the concept that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements. They are earth, water, air, and fire.
This, just like the four states of matter (in the same order) - solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, yet it proposed that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Indeed, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Also, there can be alloys that include non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
So, when it came out, the pencil was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing styles, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and fewer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to approach a typewriter.
When something new comes, one can only wonder what will become of the keyboard.
The explosive bomb operates on the principle of collecting all available energy into the nucleus using protons and neutrons.
Like a heavy cart rolling down a hill. By re-splitting the nucleus, some energy is then released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate and disintegrate with little or no contact.
The Moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The edge is 70 km thick on the near side, and 100 km on the far side.
It is thin at the calf and thick at the thigh.
There could be a lot of maria nearby because the crust is thin. It was easy for the lava to rise.
Current concepts are focused on finding what appeals to people.
These concepts suggest that as people mature into adulthood, they possess certain inherent needs and/or desires.
These concepts indicate what makes certain people want what they do and what makes the things around them do or not do certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when administrators begin to lead their former peers. One manifestation is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or gals).
This type of supervisor has the challenge of making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end, it turns into an unknown individual who feels that they should change everything the team was doing and make it their own.
Regardless, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often causes conflict between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same high standards as traditional teams, but they have subtle differences.
Virtual team members serve as a point of contact for their close physical team.
Because they are more often self-managing than typical team members, they connect across various time zones that their local managers cannot comprehend.
The existence of a true “hidden team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
"The Invisible Team" is a management team where each of its members reports. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member.
Why did an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? It is a goal to put the concepts of organizational learning into practice.
If all available resources are properly utilized within the organization's departments, innovation and ingenuity will become evident.
For this reason, an organization working collaboratively to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous method through which the institution's approach was employed to help organizations achieve high performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence concerning the theoretical approach to perceptual investigation. Therefore, it narrows the scope of the research and makes it more accurate.
The relationship between the study of mental illness and behavior helps researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, emotional traumas, lesions, and internal tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to observe and examine brain structures and processes in unprecedented ways.
This provides us with a lot of information and resources to build simulation models that help us understand mental processes.
Although AI has a strong presence in science fiction, AI is a crucial field of computer science that studies behavior, learning, and intelligence and their implementation in machines.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer inquiries and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become distinct systems, which are focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military fields; they have also been integrated into many home computers and video game applications.
Field trips are an integral part of any class. Often, the teacher prefers to take her students to places inaccessible by bus.
Technology provides the solution of virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquatic environments, or appreciate beautiful art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on the trip and share experiences for future lessons.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their annual trip to the state capital; each year the website is revised, but previous versions remain online because they serve as a reference.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with flawed grammar and writing, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve articles to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "compels students to have more knowledge about the world around them." The necessity of catering to the audience's interests motivates students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to deepen their learning beyond the typical academic day.
The proper use of blogs strengthens students to be analysts and strong critics; by diligently responding to internet educational materials, students can express their position relative to others in other writings, as well as express their own views on certain issues (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, home to numerous art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north is Muskoka and beyond, untouched natural beauty.
All these things and more reliably position Ontario as what outsiders consider Canadian.
In the north, vast open spaces are rare, and some are uninhabitable wildernesses.
Surprisingly, in a population comparison, there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is the largest of all existing and is a continent in itself.
Most small islands are independent countries or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, and it has spread widely in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century because the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
On the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All female travelers are advised to state they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also beneficial (as long as it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should consider that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as harassment, and that being followed, pulled by the hand, etc., is not uncommon.
Be firm in refusing men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and it served as a strategic port called Anfa for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Blanca, abandoning it again after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city, naming it Daru El Badya, and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least exciting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find traditional Moroccan items being sold, such as pottery, ceramic goods, leather products, shisha pipes, and general souvenirs, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located near Rwanda, at the eastern tip of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcanic eruption destroyed and buried most of the streets in Goma, particularly the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside of Goma should be thoroughly investigated to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
In addition to offering some of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa, the city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The standard (local) fare for a short trip is approximately 500 Congolese Francs.
Coupled with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become an archetypal symbol for rare and distant lands.
Even today, Timbuktu, although its fame makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport, is a poor city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS Wonders of the African World.
Because it has more of an Arab than African appearance, the city is a complete contrast to the country's other cities.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each with different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions, and is considered the main symbol of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It might be beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card that offers entry to parks in South Africa and all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gave its name to the Hong Kong territory, is a place many tourists consider a main attraction.
The array of skyscrapers that define Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a bar chart that glitters due to Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront across the harbour.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along its northern shore.
This is a place the English colonizers claimed as their own, and therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial era, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) across the territories of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest section within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not only mangrove swamps - they include the last remnants of the formidable forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², one-third of which is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife habitat, and it is currently estimated that there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart all day long from the provincial bus terminal (across the river), although most of them, especially those traveling to the East and Jakar/Bumtan, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since local buses are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese Coaster buses.
Shared taxis like Paro (Nu 150) and Panuka (Nu 200) are fast and convenient ways to travel to nearby places.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the entire Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, with a total height of 378 meters, and it features two roads that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to the public until March 2017.
When the Brazilian customs inspection is expected to be completed, the bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017.
The Guaraní were a very important indigenous group of the country, living as semi-nomadic hunters and practicing subsistence agriculture in what is now eastern Paraguay.
In the Chaco region, other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagua survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as "the vast territory of the Indians," was formed as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a colonial period that lasted for three hundred years.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve many indigenous characteristics and identities.
Argentina is very well known for having one of the very best polo teams and players in the world.
The year's biggest competition will take place in December at the Las Canitas polo fields.
Here, small competitions and games can also be seen during other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, refer to the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is set equal to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British Pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US Dollars are also often accepted.
While British and United States currency may be accepted, credit cards might not be accepted on the outer islands; please confirm accepted payment methods with the owners beforehand.
It is impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands; therefore, exchange your money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer there, and conversely, it's winter.
Montevideo is located in a semi-tropical region; in the summer months, temperatures of +30°C are common.
The winter can be deceptively cold; the temperature sometimes drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons; the amount of rainfall remains more or less the same throughout the year.
While most animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is, after all, wild, and they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other animals.
No matter how tame they may seem, buffalo, wild boars, deer, bears, and all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year for failing to keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous; so give them space.
Additionally, be aware that scents attract bears and other wild animals; therefore, avoid carrying or preparing scented foods, and clean your campsite.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of slightly less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, when seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain refused to leave the port, it became the scene of a lesser-known naval confrontation.
Except for one English warship, all ships had sunk. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
A peaceful assembly in the city during the freedom struggle organized by the Mau movement resulted in the killing of the great chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches due to its two ports. The most famous ones are located in three places.
The North Shore bays (in the North Harbour District) are on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All are indeed sandy beaches suitable for swimming, many of which have shelter provided by Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive's waterfront attractions in Central Auckland are on Waitematā Harbour, within the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers.
These are family beaches that sometimes get crowded, and have various types of shops surrounding the beach. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', not a complex beer, but enjoyable and satisfying. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to choose from, but New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of 'flat white' coffee is very different. A short black is an 'espresso', cappuccino comes piled with cream (not foam), and tea is also served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but they are very good.
Sea excursions are conducted all year round, and accidents caused by sea-related factors are rare.
Still take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur north of 1770 from October to April near coastal resorts and river estuaries. Outside of these times, they may occasionally be found.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not truly reside in the ocean; their main habitat is the estuarine river in the northern part of Rockhampton.
Pre-registering gives travelers peace of mind, as they know they will have a place to stay upon arrival.
Although you might find that you can book other types of accommodation, such as campgrounds, through a travel agent, travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or combined flight and hotel packages.
Also, if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (for example, a visa) for your destination, they can hold the place for you.
However, any modifications or questions should be handled by the travel agent, not directly by the hotel.
For some festivals, a great many music festival participants decide to rest on-site, and many participants consider this a valuable part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you must arrive early to find a spot near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages ends, there might be sections of the event that continue to play music until late into the night.
Some festivals have a separate camping area for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, verify the cabin layout, as traveling through ice causes a very disturbing sound for those most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruise tours include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos typically make many efforts to increase the time and money guests spend. Windows and clocks are often not available, and exits can be difficult to find.
They mostly have special food, drink, and entertainment provisions to keep guests in a good mood while they are at the entrance.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages for free. But, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the benefit of sobriety.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or on mountain passes should bear in mind that there could be snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On snowy and icy roads, friction is low; you cannot drive as you would on bare asphalt.
Snow capable of immobilizing you can fall very quickly during extremely cold and snowy conditions.
Visibility can be obstructed by falling or blowing snow, by water spray, or by ice on car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries, icy and snowy conditions are common, and traffic largely continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's biggest draw for tourism, highlighting it for many visitors.
The word 'Safari' commonly refers to overland travel to view the beautiful African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, so standard equipment provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with a telescope.
Hiking (referred to as 'bushwalking,' 'mountain climbing treks,' or 'walking on foot') involves mountain climbing for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Having hosted the games in 1964, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Winter Olympics.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodation before the extension was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies in effect by the end of March will not last until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
While standard tickets cost around ¥7,000, most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000.
Ironing wet clothes helps them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if they aren't in the room.
If you don't have an iron or you don't like creased socks, you can use a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (it can cause creasing or, in some severe cases, burning).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers might encounter unfamiliar animal pests in their native areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, worse yet, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or inflict bites.
Dangerous animals that can cause infectious diseases themselves, or harm or kill people by force, are often not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase certain items that are exempt from mandatory taxes in specific areas.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh expressways between Point Marion and Fairmont, frequently passing through rugged terrain, presents very difficult driving conditions.
If you are unaccustomed to driving on rural roads, maintain your caution: steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits in the preceding and subsequent sections — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — are noticeably lower, and it is very important to strictly adhere to them rather than disregard them.
Surprisingly, however, mobile service here is stronger than in other places where the lines are laid, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweet cakes are great, and in Bavaria, like their southern neighbor, Austria, they are rich and diverse.
Fruit baked goods are common throughout the year, with apples ripening for baking and strawberries and berries appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes usually pair exceptionally well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small sweet cakes, try to find out what they are called – Berliner Pfannkuchen or Krapfen – depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, with meat or vegetables.
A dish cooked with spices can be 'dry' or 'wet' based on its liquid content.
In the inland areas of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is traditionally used in curries, while in South India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most often used.
Comprising 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without any other modifiers, the word refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Widely available in the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features simply seasoned dishes. The main flavorings favored by Javanese people include peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's legs that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability to the driver, but there could be safety risks because the driver's foot might get stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but one foot remains caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged while the horse runs. To reduce the danger, many safety precautions must be taken.
To begin with, many riders put on their riding boots that have heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety stirrup bars that allow the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle when pulled backward by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley, Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, boasts numerous diverse large granite walls and boulders.
High places feature breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are creating new routes on the endless wall.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports, and they involve sliding downwards on snow-covered ground with skis or a snowboard attached to one's feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity that has many enthusiasts, known as "snow lovers," who plan entire vacation seasons around skiing in one place.
The concept of sliding on snow is very old - cave paintings depicting snow sliders date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Traveling with a ski backpack: This activity is called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
