This confirms not only the widespread concept that dinosaurs had feathers, but also details that fossils cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers stated that the plumage of this animal is dark brown above and pale or orange below.
The finding provides an insight into feather evolution in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a developed shaft called a rachis, but possessed other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers say that the rachis is an older evolutionary outcome than these other characteristics.
The feather structure is not for flight but rather for thermoregulation or display. Researchers stated that although this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, the sample consists of adult feathers, not chicken feathers.

Although the work performed was largely theoretically supported, the program was written to simulate observations from the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for is caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon has gravitational force on Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way has gravitational force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The scientists have concluded that the effect dark matter has on other dark matter is just like that of ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding the galaxy is found within a halo around it and is composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll identified a severe, drug-resistant type of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, the new variant stated, "This is very concerning and frightening due to a very high death rate."
Some patients may have contracted the infection in the hospital; Dr. Mol believes at least two of them are hospital healthcare workers.
Within a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 of their close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB among the total number of people infected with tuberculosis still seems low; in South Africa, for instance, it accounts for 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected with the disease at any given moment.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience, with voters secluding themselves in a booth and placing a pre-printed paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the ballot into the ballot box and signs the voter list.

Candidates may send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, votes shall be counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following prescribed procedures.

She has been taken into custody awaiting charges and prosecutorial evidence, but any eyewitness testimony may not be admissible due to widespread public discourse concerning her.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently, and courts view publishing photographs as prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University said, "If journalists publish photos and other information of suspects, it seems journalists are treading a dangerous line."
The Aklil General Prosecutor's Office said it would not comment to journalists until there was evidence for the charges.
The document, according to the leaked information, refers to the border dispute Palestine wishes to be based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered, as reported, include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel wants a continued military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed, while the PA, for its part, agrees to such a presence for only five years.
In additional pest control trials, applicators are closely monitored by supervisors, as the trial is controlled and its effectiveness has been evaluated.
Through the Sport Shooters Association's hunting program, qualified volunteers were recruited in partnership with NPWS and the Australian Sport Shooters Association (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Protection and Heritage of NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received a comprehensive safety and training briefing.
Martelly was sworn into the new nine-member Transitional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the early release of the CEP as part of a package of measures to take the country to new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Protests, some of which have turned violent, have stemmed from the failure to hold elections, with some dating back to 2011.
Approximately 60 iPod overheating incidents were reported, causing malfunctions; a total of six fires occurred, resulting in moderate burns to four people.
Japan's Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated it had identified 27 accidents related to its equipment.
Last week, METI stated that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents which it described as “not serious.”
The Minister responded to Apple's data transfer, calling it "truly regrettable."
The earthquake hit Marina at 07:19 AM local time (Friday 09:19 PM GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said there were no reported damages in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a bus in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines, and held Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza shot his M16 rifle at the tourists.
A number of hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed thus far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as Filipino photographers, were previously released.
Because she wanted to go to the restroom, the photographers took the old woman's spot. Mendoza was killed by a gun.
Ligins joined the medical profession, following in his father's footsteps.
Having received training as an obstetrician-gynecologist, they began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Ligins began studying premature labor in his spare time.
His study indicates that hormone administration accelerates fetal lung maturity.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Her fellow fighters also expressed their condolences to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the original extreme queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night of two moons. Uniquely beautiful, just like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was very crazy like me... maybe more than me... I love her and I will miss her... We hope she is in a better place."
Among 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last Queen.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his injuries, his fitness was in doubt.
Due to his ban from the games, he was unable to take the medication required to manage his pain.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has found the largest prime number as of January 25.
The discovery was confirmed by many people using various hardware and software by early February and publicly announced on Tuesday.
Comets may possibly be a source of Earth's water supply, along with organic compounds that can form proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with Earth long ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly how Earth formed.
The 53-year-old Kumo, who began his rule earlier this year, signed a law to legalize same-sex marriage last month.
He referred to the accusations as 'political turmoil and foolishness'.
He/She is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA announces will enable an aircraft to save millions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon emissions by making shorter trips.
Unlike older ground-radar based technology, air traffic controllers use satellite-based technology to identify aircraft with greater precision and to provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional services are being added and overground trains will not stop at Wembley; and car parking is not available at our Park and Ride facilities.
Fears of transportation shortages increased the likelihood of the game being forced to take place behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in a science journal reported the creation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species formed in just two generations due to breeding between the rare Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris, although this process was expected to take a longer time.
Gold can be worked into all forms. It can be drawn into fine threads.
It can be drawn into a fine wire capable of being bent and coiled. It can be hammered flat to a smooth finish or rolled.
It is beaten very thin and affixed to another metal. Due to its ability to be beaten so thin, it was used for ornamentation on hand-drawn illustrations in books known as 'Illuminated Manuscripts'.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage liquid.
Cabbage juice changes color based on its chemical acidity or alkalinity.
The pH value within the tested chemical is indicated by the concentration of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (thus, hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron).
Combine the two dry flours together, then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands interacts with the outer layers, creating a peculiar sensation and forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had flush toilets in every house, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
The remains of the sewage system were found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, latrines also existed. In Roman civilization, latrines were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled.
When you call someone living thousands of miles away, you are using satellite.
The satellite in space receives its call and instantly reflects it back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Since the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and observations, researchers use telescopes in space.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a massive rocket over 100 feet tall is required.
The wheel has changed the world in an astonishing way. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to provide very simple and fast transportation.
He has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Under them are medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized animals, ranging from rabbits to deer.
Lastly, there are many small cats that eat a great many small animals such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds (including loose domestic cats).
The secret of their success is the field concept, a unique task that prevents each cat from competing with each other.
Lions are very social cats that live in large groups called prides.
Lion prides consist of one to three young males, up to thirty females, and cubs.
The females are often very closely related to one another, many being families of sisters and daughters.
Lion-biters, like wolves or dogs, are very dangerous to animals like lions (but not other big cats) and to their prey.
The leopard is a well-built athlete, capable of climbing (though not well), swimming, jumping long distances, and dragging with five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers are in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (Genus Panthera). Only these four cats can roar.
A tiger's roar is not a full-throated roar like a lion's, but rather more like a series of noisy phrases and roaring words.
Ocelots/Desert cats like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots/desert cats hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists find that ocelots/desert cats track and locate their prey by blowing on and sniffing the ground where the animals were.
They have good night vision and are agile movers. Ocelots locate their prey by blending in with their surroundings.
Small populations of living things, when they disperse from their main population (for example, by crossing mountainous terrain or a river, or by traveling to a new island from which they cannot easily return), often find themselves in an environment different from their original habitat.
This new environment has various resources and competitors; therefore, the new species will require different traits or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than previously necessary.
The original species has never changed, it still requires the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, its similarities with other populations will diminish.
Ultimately, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations would have diverged so much in appearance that they could no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the creation of new species. The creation of new species is an inevitable outcome and an essential part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants prepare their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes from plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Animals cannot live without plants.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurus.
Its long jaws were equipped with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set on the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything passing by.
We don't know for certain, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it might even have been a cannibal.
It would attack anything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex could not be its match.
While we are familiar with most of their foods, the Romans had exotic or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of mouse called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women eat their food sitting on chairs, the rich prefer to hold grand banquets where they socialize on the side while consuming their meals.
Ancient Roman foods could not have included ingredients that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or even cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a principal temple for each of their gods, which was considered a house of the gods.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to attend to the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called Ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the building was a special sanctuary for his God.
In the hot Middle Eastern climate, the house was not particularly important.
Most Hebrew family life was spent outdoors.
Women cook food in the yard; shops were open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. According to Norse Sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, traveling westward, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were living there at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the film National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Despite what is written on the back of the document, this is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is visible inverted at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, early in its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, the note may have been added only as an identifier.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France; however, the south was still not liberated.
It was administered by the "Vichy" French. These were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and, instead of fighting them, collaborated with the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated Southern France and were already heading back to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a community of large populations living and working cooperatively.
The word 'civilization' is derived from 'civilis', meaning 'civil', and is connected to the Latin 'civis', which means 'citizen', as well as 'civitas', meaning 'city' or 'city administration', which in some way describes the scale of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. The culture of civilization refers to the transmission of knowledge through multiple generations, an enduring cultural legacy, and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving valuable historical evidence and are not recognized as conventional civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially established a weak central government—meaning Congress was their only body—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Council had no authority to levy taxes, and, with no national executive or court, it often relied on uncooperative state leaders to enforce all its laws.
Also, it did not have the power to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles, prior to their adoption, required the collective consent of all regions; and as the regions did not properly engage with the central government, their representatives were largely absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the German national team, and they were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
As Italians compete in international games and the Olympics, winter sports are particularly popular in the northern regions.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the world's 7th largest island country!
Due to its collection of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical terms.
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in southern Taiwan by initiating changes in the indigenous people's grain production practices and by hiring Chinese day laborers to work in its sugar and rice factories.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which then controlled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three main structures known as the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings within the compound have been rebuilt to give tourists a better understanding of how they originally came to be.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the reconstruction work continues to this day.
For example, the most common image photography format in the world is still 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but its aspect ratio has been superseded by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format was, in fact, somewhat confusing, measuring 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The beleaguered and derided third-party rule is a simple guide for creating flexibility while maintaining a certain degree in the image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into three (see example).
During this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united the states of Europe despite linguistic and cultural differences.
The all-destructive power affects everyone, from the great to the small.
One of the core Christian tenets is that wealth should be utilized to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the Church's financial fund is specifically earmarked for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this accumulation of power and money led many to question whether its fundamental guiding principles were being upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to blockade the German navy.
Although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, enshrined in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries, the strategy has been effective by cutting off essential military and civilian supplies.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any British vessel from traversing vast expanses of water, a situation that even endangered neutral ships.
As there was only a limited response to the tactic, Germany expected a similar outcome for unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the dominant characteristic of many citizens and nations was anti-war and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and cruelties of war during the First World War, countries sought to prevent such a situation from recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He entered the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a thank-you letter to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor, his former supervisor.
Ancient China has a unique way of marking different time periods, with each historical period – or rather, each ruling family – having a distinct dynasty.
And it was an unstable period of fragmented states between the dynasties. The most notable period during these times was the sixty-year Three Kingdoms era, which took place between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times, a fierce war ensued among many princes vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a bloody period in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people fighting and dying as they struggled to sit on the highest throne in the Xian palace.
There are numerous social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to popular sovereignty, nationalism, and the understanding that the country belongs to the people, not a sole ruler.
Furthermore, after the revolution, professions that were highly sought after and enabled success were open to all male applicants.
The same applied to the soldiers, as military classification was now based on caliber rather than on class.
The French Revolution inspired the oppressed working-class people of many other countries to start their own uprisings.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this mundane life. To meditate, he used to frequent the cave known as 'Hira'' on the mountain of 'Nur' (Light).
The cave itself, which survived from that era, provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Its location atop one of the mountains north of Mecca made the cave completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Indeed, even if its existence is known, it is by no means easy to locate. Once within the cave, it is complete isolation.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky surrounding the many mountains. From inside the cave, only a very small part of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, is one of several large pyramid structures constructed to honor the dead pharaoh.
The "Giza Plateau" or "Giza Necropolis", located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains numerous pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the small pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family.
The 'upper fold' mark looks like a V, and the 'lower fold' mark looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom part.
"Up" means you must push the bow, starting at the tip, whereas "Down" means you must start from the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upstroke usually produces a soft sound, but the downstroke is stronger and more assertive.
You may make your own markings in pencil, but the printed bowing marks are placed for musical reasons and therefore must be respected.
The very startled King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister Madame Élisabeth were forced by an angry mob of market women to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris, surrounded by a large crowd shouting and making threats against the King and Queen.
People gathered for an uprising forced the King and Queen to open their carriage windows widely.
On one occasion, a member of a mob was waving the severed head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles, in front of the startled queen.
United States imperialism paid the cost of the war for the Filipino people.
In the name of the Government of the Philippines, it was agreed to pay outstanding costs and bond interest to U.S. purchasing power through Wall Street banks.
Indeed, the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people, among the most profitable established ventures, yields fundamental benefits for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must grasp the circumstances that led to the formation of the religious group.
The period in which the events occurred is known as the High Middle Ages in European history, referring to the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages are preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends in 1500.
Technological commitment is a strong sentiment inclined to believe that it practically encompasses numerous ideas, and that its origin lies in a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and the manifestation of technology, a logic which shifts from a technology-driven approach or technological imperative towards human destiny.
Most definitions of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a largely independent path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, for its part, has "effects" on societies that are inherent in its nature, rather than being determined by social conditions.
For example, a motor vehicle can be said to necessarily lead to road development.
However, a nationwide road network for small cars is not economically viable; therefore, new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The ownership of multiple vehicles also results in a high incidence of road accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques for repairing damaged components.
Romanticism constituted a significant part of the cultural undertaking that emerged from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, cultures related to geography and rules that conformed to society's place were superior to arbitrary rule-making.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was called the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
The reputation of being a major center of luxury continued from 400 A.D. until 1100 A.D.
In the twelfth century, the situation deteriorated primarily because Christian warriors returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, valued beyond what the Byzantine market supplied.
It was at this time that the title of 'fashion capital' was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic architecture was at its height between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, the dress had a significant influence on Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow means of communication, Western lifestyles may lag by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own style of dress. Due to the wars, one of the greatest developments of the time was people beginning to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture means when a farmer's produce is only sufficient for himself and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that is carried out by utilizing saved seeds indigenous to the ecosystem and integrating them with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this remains true in many developing countries.
Subcultures facilitate the coming together of like-minded individuals who feel socially marginalized, enabling them to foster a sense of identity.
Internal cultures may differ based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that make a subculture unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a distinct and symbolic style, including fashion, practices, and argot.
One of the most common ways we explain the importance of social life is by observing children who grew up in adverse conditions, experiencing abuse or hardship, and who did not learn to live alongside their caregivers.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some wild children have been confined by people (often their own parents); in some cases, this child's abandonment is due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Abandoned children may have experienced severe child abuse or emotional trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the forest.
When fully raised by non-human animals, a feral child entirely exhibits behaviors characteristic of animals (for example, fear or indifference towards humans).
While project-based learning is necessary to make learning easy and engaging, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support that assists individuals beginning a new learning process, for instance, those using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Summaries can be conceptual or factual. In other words, illustratively, just as one attaches a document in Microsoft Office, the miniature form is a method of summarization.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded within the software and are intended to prompt the student to inquire about, explore, and explain procedures that might be challenging for them to grasp alone.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even theft.
No child should grow up in an environment lacking care, nurturing, and education, but they inevitably do.
We see the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is expected to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is presumed to provide all necessary things lacking in the home where they were previously placed.
The Internet combines the characteristics of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet, concerning the uses and gratification approach, lead to additional dimensions.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been indicated as critical motivators for internet services (James et al., 1995).
Furthermore, "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects when Igbaria and Macord (1998) examined audience responses to websites.
Video recordings have led to significant discoveries by enabling the interpretation of subtle expressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is believed that by accurately interpreting micro-expressions, one can ascertain whether a person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay titled 'The President's Speech,' demonstrated how people unable to understand speech due to brain damage were accurately able to assess sincerity.
It was mentioned that such abilities to identify human characteristics can also be shared by animals like domesticated dogs.
Twentieth-century research shows that genetic variation has two pools: latent and manifest.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the available pool of variation.
Between the two pools, the contentious difference of separation and reintegration with each generation.
In the savanna, for hominids with a human-like digestive system, it is difficult to satisfy amino acid requirements from locally available plant food sources.
Additionally, failure to do this has severe consequences: depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources could have been proteins found in leaves and pulses, but these are difficult for mammals like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily digestible and provide proteins containing all essential amino acids in high quantities.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors, just as savanna chimpanzees do today, solved their "protein problem" to some extent.
Sleep interruption is the process of consciously waking up during your regular sleep period and falling back asleep after a short time (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you from your sleep.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the opposite side of the room to make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, which forces one to wake up to urinate.
A person's inner peace is inversely related to the level of tension within their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force becomes. Each person has the potential to attain perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can acquire knowledge. The only thing standing in the way is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but is extended by the Mahayana path of compassion and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and an all-encompassing journey of love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the power of awareness) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is Deity Yoga. Through various deity visualizations, the energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness arises.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, fostering cooperation between the USSR and the USA. When the war ended, conflicts in systems, processes, and cultures led the nations to collapse.
Two years before the war ended, as former allies had become enemies, the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and the actual fighting would be waged on battlefields from Africa to Asia, including Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other locations.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had been broken, and the only remaining hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian lines.
However, these plans failed overnight after 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army, in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, invaded and moved into Poland's eastern regions, establishing Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
The use of ships for transporting goods, and for transporting large numbers of people and goods across oceans, is by far the most effective method among all existing.
The traditional role of naval forces is to protect your country's ability to transport people and goods, and concurrently to disrupt your enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
A noteworthy recent example is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was attempting to halt this traffic primarily using U-boats.
Had the Allied nations fallen, Germany, having occupied the entirety of Europe, might also have been able to occupy Britain.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to expect milk, wool, meat, and hides to be readily provided.
Most often, domestic goats have been kept in wandering herds in mountains or other grazing areas, where they are often tended as kids or adults, in ways typical of a known shepherd. These herding methods are still in use today.
In the early 16th century, Wagenhuis was built in England.
Although the chariots consisted only of parallel planks, they enabled horses pulling them to achieve greater speed and haul larger loads than was possible on the somewhat challenging roads of the day.
Cross-ties were introduced quite early to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that tracks would be more effective if they had an iron surface on top.
This became a common practice, but iron caused more damage to the wagons' wooden wheels.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by metal. In 1767, the first all-metal rails were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking; people began walking two million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
The earlier Australopithecus did not habitually walk upright.
Although bipedal adaptations have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become advocates to, to some extent, reduce future suffering.
In many cases, this is symptomatic treatment. However, if we are not seeking merely a temporary solution, then we must find the root of the problems and eradicate them.
It is clearly evident that the world has undergone profound changes due to scientific and technological advancements, and that problems have been escalating as a result of human overpopulation and unsustainable human lifestyles.
On July 4th, after being approved by Congress, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was taken to the printing house a few rows away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies, now called “Dunlap Broadsides,” were produced.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8.
The first was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he had it read out to his troops in New York on July 9. The copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlop Tracts known to date are ancient copies that have survived from the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with teeth and claws, they lay eggs, and like a T-Rex, they walk on their two hind legs.
Currently, almost all computers are based on the flow of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary digit can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These digits are known as binary digits – or bits, to use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently general that a rapid diagnosis may not be possible.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of open medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the text for specific first aid instructions if they exist for that specific poison.
The word "bed bug" is the formal name used by entomologists for an insect group.
This word comes from ancient species of bed bugs, which are highly adapted insects to live close to humans.
Both biting flies and bed bugs are parasitic, adapted to live in their dwellings or in their parasitic hosts.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has confirmed that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
Couples may decide that raising a child is not their desire or their child's desire.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple may raise the children.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world operates through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides a great deal of scientific research.
However, it is not by itself; testing, and an experiment—defined as a test useful for eliminating one or more hypotheses—along with asking questions and conducting observations, also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's view is accepted in all scientific fields, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West became detached from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many physiological and behavioral rhythms are often primarily determined by the existence of natural cycles and the activity of biological clocks.
Circadian rhythms that are not merely simple responses to external periodic cues have been recorded for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a free-running cycle even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the pivotal findings that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments by labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus and the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
A mutation can have various, diverse effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material fragment, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only alterations made to germline cells can be transmitted to children, whereas alterations made to other cells lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism provides enjoyment for people interested in visiting natural environments, allowing them to experience plants and animals, including wildlife.
Examples of activities conducted at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is learning about, visiting, and photographing orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small rural towns to their workplaces, passing by others whose jobs are in the towns they've left behind.
In this evolving transport landscape, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has destabilized the biosphere from the stable condition that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, equally common complaints are sometimes heard about water quality and bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Does it simply mean transport engineers are incompetent? Or is something more fundamental taking place?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement and interaction of drivers and vehicles between two points.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows have a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections assist in the planning, design, and execution of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them easily evade predators and efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings by retracting their bodies.
This provides them with a wide range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus said the solar system revolves around the sun.
While some people thought it was correct, many people, on the contrary, believed that the solar system, including the sun and other stars, revolved around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't appear to move, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
Additionally, the Amazon is the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the very end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza Pyramids were never surpassed in their size and the technical scale of their construction.
The New Kingdom ancient Egyptians were impressed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the world's smallest sovereign state and the least populous country.
Vatican City employs Italian in its statutes and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, as all of these are naturally occurring and were easy to mine with ancient tools.
The philosopher Aristotle put forth the concept that all things are a mixture of one or more of four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
This, much like the four states of matter (in the same order) - solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, proposed the transformation into new substances to create what we observe.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as Calcium and Potassium are considered metals. Indeed, there are also metals like Silver and Gold.
Also, there can be alloys that include non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillion of them can fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, when he came out, he was a good friend to many people.
Regrettably, with the advent of new writing styles, the pencil has been relegated to a diminished status and fewer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever needing to approach a recording device.
When something new comes along, one can only wonder what will become of the keyboard.
An explosive bomb operates on the principle of concentrating all the energy from available protons and neutrons into a nucleus.
Like a heavy cart rolling down a hill. By re-splitting the nucleus, a certain amount of energy is then released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate and disintegrate with little or no external influence.
The lunar surface is composed of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The edge is 70 km thick on the near side, and 100 km on the far side.
It is slender in the lowlands and robust in the highlands.
Extensive maria may exist nearby due to the thin crust, which made it easy for lava to rise.
The current concepts are focused on finding what appeals to people.
These concepts suggest that as people mature into adulthood, they have certain inherent needs and/or desires.
These concepts indicate what makes certain individuals desire to act, and what causes elements in their environment to act or refrain from acting in certain ways.
Two prominent content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor theory.
Generally speaking, two characteristics may emerge when administrators begin to lead their former peers. One is the attempt to continue to be 'one of the guys' (or gals).
This type of supervisor has the difficulty of making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, conducting performance appraisals, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, someone transforms into an unrecognizable individual, driven by the belief that they must alter everything the group was doing and claim it as their own.
It is the leader who is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often causes conflict between leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups are held to similar high standards as conventional groups, but they have subtle differences.
Virtual team members serve as liaison points for their immediate physical teams.
Given that they are more self-managing than typical team members, they often connect across various time zones that local administrators cannot comprehend.
The existence of a real “secret group” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of the imaginary group.
"The Invisible Group" is a management team to which each of its members reports. The Invisible Group sets standards for each member.
Why did an organization wish to undergo the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? It is a goal-oriented initiative to put organizational learning concepts into practice.
If all available resources are properly utilized within the organization's departments, innovation and ingenuity will be evident.
Therefore, an organization working collaboratively to overcome an obstacle may lead to a new innovative process to serve the client's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must foster a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the ongoing methodology through which the institution's approach has been utilized to help organizations achieve high performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to perceptual investigation. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it more accurate.
The relationship between the study of mental illness and behavior assists researchers in their investigations.
It has long been recognized that various types of brain damage, psychological injuries, lesions, and internal inflammations affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to observe and examine brain structures and processes in unprecedented ways.
This provides us with much information and resources to build simulation models to aid our understanding of processes within our minds.
Despite its strong presence in science fiction, AI is a crucial branch of computer science that studies behavior, learning, and intelligence in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automatically perform tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer inquiries and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become specialized systems, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now largely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military; they have also been integrated into many home computer and video game applications.
Field trips are an integral part of any class. Often, the teacher prefers to take her students to places inaccessible by bus.
Technology provides the solution for virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquatic environments, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on the trip and share experiences for future lessons.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their annual trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned every year, but older versions remain online as they serve as a reference.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often begin their blogging with flawed grammar and writing, the presence of an audience generally alters that.
As students are often a very critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve their articles to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "requires students to be more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to cater to the audience's interests motivates students to become proficient and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blog writing is a tool that promotes collaboration and enables students to further their learning beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs "strengthens students to become analytical and strong critics; by diligently responding to online educational materials, students can express their stance relative to other texts, and articulate their own views on specific issues" (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's attractive, bilingual capital, home to numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south, Niagara Falls is located, while to the north is Muskoka and beyond that, untouched natural beauty.
All these things and more reliably position Ontario as Canadian in the eyes of outsiders.
In the north, extensive areas are not only scarce, but some are also uninhabitable wildernesses.
To the surprise of many, there are more African Americans living in the United States than the entire population of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is the largest to date and a continent in itself.
Most small islands are independent countries or are associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, and it became very widespread in Comoros and Mayotte.
With the discovery of the Cape route from Europe to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, European influence and colonization began in the 15th century.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female travelers are advised to state they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also useful (though it shouldn't look very expensive).
Women should consider that cultural differences lead to what they perceive as harassment, and that being followed and pulled by the hand, etc., is not uncommon.
Be firm in refusing men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (regardless of cultural differences, it doesn't make it acceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca, founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, served Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Blanca, but abandoned it again after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city, naming it Daru El Badya, and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least enjoyable places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find traditional Moroccan goods for sale, such as pottery, ceramics, leather products, shisha pipes, and general trinkets, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcanic eruption destroyed and buried most of the city's streets in Goma, particularly the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside Goma require careful assessment of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
In addition to being one of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa, the city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price for a short trip is approximately 500 Congolese francs.
Coupled with its relative lack of accessibility, "Timbuktu" has become an archetypal symbol for remote and exotic lands.
Even today, Timbuktu, despite its fame making it a tourist attraction and its having an airport, is a poor city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates's PBS 'Wonders of the African World'.
Because it has a more Arab than African character, the city is in complete contrast to the country's other cities.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones; each contains diverse wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions, and it is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It might be beneficial for one to purchase a Wild Card that grants access to parks in South Africa, including all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gave its name to the Hong Kong territory, is a place many tourists consider a main attraction.
The array of skyscrapers that form the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a bar chart sparkling due to Victoria Harbor.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront across the harbor.
The majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island has been constructed on reclaimed land along its northern shore.
This is a place the English colonizers took as their own, and therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial era, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) along the coasts of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include the last remnants of the formidable forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², one-third of which is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been home to wildlife, and it is currently estimated that there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart throughout the day from the provincial bus terminal (across the river), although most, particularly those traveling to the east and Jakar/Bumtan, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since local buses are frequently full, it is advisable to purchase tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese Coaster buses.
Shared taxis like Paro (Nu 150) and Panuka (Nu 200) are fast and convenient ways to travel to nearby places.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the entire Oyapock River, connecting the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high; its span is 378 meters, and it has two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to the public until March 2017.
Upon the expected completion of the Brazilian customs inspection, the bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017.
The Guaraní, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture in what is now Eastern Paraguay, were a very important indigenous group of the country.
In the Chaco region, other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payaguá, survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "the vast territory of the Indians," emerged as a result of the Spanish conquerors' encounter with indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a three-hundred-year colonial period.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve many indigenous characteristics and identities.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the world's very best polo teams and players.
The year's major competition will be held in December at the Las Canitas polo fields.
Here, minor competitions and games may also be observed during other times of the year.
For news on competitions, polo matches, and information on ticket purchases, refer to the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged at par with the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the Islands, in Stanley, beyond the FIC West store.
British Pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US Dollars are also often accepted.
While British and U.S. currency may be accepted, credit cards might not be accepted on the outer islands; please confirm with the proprietors in advance what acceptable payment methods are.
It is not possible to exchange Falkland Islands currency off the islands; therefore, exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is situated in a subtropical zone; during the summer months, temperatures of +30°C are common.
Winters can be deceptively cold; the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons; rainfall remains more or less consistent throughout the year.
While most animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wildlife is inherently wild and, as such, must not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other animals.
No matter how docile they may appear, buffalo, wild boars, deer, bears, and all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured annually due to not maintaining proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous; therefore, give them space.
Additionally, be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife; therefore, avoid handling or preparing odorous foods and clean your campsite.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is on Upolu Island and has a population of slightly less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port became the scene of a little-known naval standoff after seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain refused to leave it.
All ships, except for one British warship, had sunk. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
A peaceful assembly in the city during the freedom struggle organized by the Mau movement resulted in the assassination of the Great Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches in Auckland due to its two ports. The most famous ones are located in three places.
The northern coastal waters (in the North Harbour District) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are all sandy beaches suitable for swimming, many of which have shelter provided by Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive's coastal attractions are situated on Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent Central Auckland suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded, where various types of shops can be found along the beachfront. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', not a complex beer, but enjoyable and satisfying. Another local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines are available, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are concerned, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of 'flat white' coffee is very different for Australians. A short black is an 'espresso', a cappuccino comes topped with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are very good, although expensive.
Underwater expeditions are conducted all year round, and injuries resulting from factors encountered within the sea are rare.
Heed advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found north of 1770 from October to April near coastal recreational areas and river mouths. Outside of these times, they may occasionally be found.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily inhabit the ocean; their main habitat is the Fitzroy River, located in the northern part of Rockhampton.
Pre-registering, knowing that they will have a place to stay upon arrival, gives travelers peace of mind.
While you might find other types of accommodation, such as campgrounds, bookable through a travel agent, travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or combined flight and hotel packages.
Also, if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents (e.g., a visa) for your destination, they can hold the place for you.
However, any modifications or requests should be handled by the travel agent, not directly by the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival participants decide to stay on site, and many participants consider this a valuable part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to arrive early to find a spot near the music.
Even after the music on the main stages concludes, remember that there may be other areas of the event still playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have a separate camping area for families with young children.
When crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, ensure the vessel's class notation, as navigating in ice generates a very distressing sound from heavily stressed areas.
Saint Petersburg cruises include city time. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos typically make many efforts to increase the time and money guests spend. Windows and clocks are often not present, and exits can be hard to locate.
They predominantly have special food, beverage, and entertainment provisions for guests, ensuring they are in good spirits and enjoy a pleasant welcome.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages for free. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the advantage of sobriety.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or on mountain passes should be aware that snow, ice, or freezing temperatures may be present.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is low; you cannot drive as you would on dry asphalt.
Snow capable of immobilizing you due to extreme cold can fall very rapidly.
Visibility can be restricted by falling or blowing snow, water mist, or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, in many countries, snowy and icy conditions are common, and traffic mostly continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's greatest draw for tourism and a highlight for many visitors.
The word 'Safari' conventionally refers to overland travel to view the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, so standard equipment provides good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes elusive and are better seen with binoculars.
Hiking (referred to as 'bushwalking,' 'mountain trekking,' or 'walking') involves mountain ascent for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Having hosted the Games in 1964, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you had already booked your 2020 flights and accommodation before the extension was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies by the end of March will not extend until July 2020, the scheduled date for the Olympics.
While typical tickets cost around ¥7,000, most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000.
Ironing damp clothes helps them to dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if not provided in the room.
If an iron is unavailable, or if you prefer un-ironed socks, if available, you can use a hair dryer.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (it can cause wrinkling or, in some severe cases, burning).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough; in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, you should consider purchasing your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar animal pests in their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, worse yet, trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit diseases.
Transmissible diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill humans by force, are often not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase certain goods that are exempt from taxes normally levied in specific areas.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont; the Buffalo-Pittsburgh expressways, frequently traversing dissected terrain, present very difficult driving conditions.
If you are unaccustomed to driving on rural roads, exercise caution: steep areas, narrow roads, and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits in the preceding and subsequent sections — typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) — are noticeably lower, and it is paramount to strictly adhere to them rather than not comply.
But surprisingly, mobile service here is stronger than in other places where lines are laid, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweet cakes are excellent, and in Bavaria, much like their southern neighbor, Austria, they are rich and diverse.
Fruit baked goods are common, with apples ripening for baking throughout the year and strawberries and berries appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods include almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair exceptionally well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some sweet cakes, depending on the region, try to find out what it is: Berliner Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, with meat or vegetables.
Spiced fried or sautéed food can be "dry" or "wet" depending on its liquid content.
In the inland areas of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries, whereas in South India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most often used.
Comprising 17,000 diverse islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further qualification, the term refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Currently widespread throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features lightly spiced dishes, with key seasonings favored by Javanese people including peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are a support for the rider's legs that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the driver, but they can pose safety risks because the driver's foot might get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but one foot remains caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged when the horse runs. Many safety precautions must be taken to minimize the risk.
First, many riders put on their riding boots, which have heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to release from the saddle when pulled backward by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley – known as 'South America's Slayer' and Chile's main climbing destination, has many different large granite walls and boulders.
Heights offer incredibly stunning views. Climbers from all over the world are creating new routes amidst the endless wall.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to one's feet.
Snow sports are a major tourism activity that has a great many enthusiasts, known as “snow lovers,” who plan their entire holiday seasons around snow sports in a single location.
The idea of sliding on snow is very old – drawings found in caves, believed to depict snow sliders, date back to as early as 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational skiing club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Travel with a ski pack: This activity is called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or snow mountaineering.
While often associated with Alpine-style ski touring or mountain trekking, it does not include them; the latter are performed in narrow terrain and require very robust long skis (or plastic ones) and boots.
Think of the ski path as a similar mountain ascent path.
In good conditions, you might cover a somewhat greater distance than walking – but without a heavy pack on a groomed path, you can often, and sometimes even, achieve cross-country ski speed.
Europe, in contrast, though a smaller continent, has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling between different countries means having to spend a lot of time on visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen Zone, however, functions as a single country in this respect.
In this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control or inspection checkpoints.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for separate visas for each Schengen member country, thereby saving time, money, and paperwork.
