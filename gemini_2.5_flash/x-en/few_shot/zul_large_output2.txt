This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but it also provides details that the fossil record does not usually offer, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say this animal's plumage had a faded brown upper breast and colorful sides.
Research also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed central shaft, known as the rachis, but had other feather features—barbs and barbules—researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for thermoregulation and display. Researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample reveals mature feathers and not a juvenile's.
Researchers suggest that, even if this is a dinosaur tail, the sample reveals ancient feathers and not a juvenile's down.

Candidates may send representatives to observe all parts of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, following specific procedures.

However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He/She was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, they were found at Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been at Edinburgh Sheriff Court since being charged with his son's murder.
He has been arrested while awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be compromised as his photograph has been widely published.
This is a common practice in some parts of the UK, but Scottish law operates differently, and the courts have viewed the publication of images as not damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University writes, “journalists bring widespread trouble upon themselves by publishing photos and other material of the accused.”
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the investigation, told reporters that it would not comment at least until the trial.
The document, according to its framers, will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics include the future of Jerusalem, which fully concerns both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants its soldiers to remain in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, even though the PA agrees to their presence for only five years.
The shooters in the trial to remove nuisance animals should have been supervised by the site managers, as the trial was being monitored and its success evaluated.
In cooperation with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Acting Director for Parks and Heritage and the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the culling program received intensive training in safety and proficiency.
Martelly swore in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of measures to enable the country to vote.
It was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests stem from the failure to hold elections, some of which were due since 2011.
Approximately 60 incidents of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people sustaining minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been aware of 27 incidents related to the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple reported an additional 34 overheating incidents, which the company called "not a big deal."
The service responded by calling Apple's withdrawal of the report “truly disappointing.”
An earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM Friday GMT).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said no damage was reported in the territory.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Agency Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines.
Rolando Mandoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
A few hostages have been released, and it has been confirmed that at least six have died so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the old woman's spot as they needed a toilet. Mendo was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and worked in the medical field.
He/She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm labor in his spare time.
His/Her research has shown that when the hormone is administered, it accelerates the development of fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders on Wednesday.
The wrestler also paid his respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna passed away two months ago tonight. It's as unique as she was. A Powerful Woman."
Dustin "Thulilwegolide" Runnels commented that "Luna was as crazy as me...maybe even more so...I love her and I will miss her...I hope she is in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 general election, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percentage points since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of voters hold the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
In the latest voting figures, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to participate in the 100m and 200m swimming events in any style, and also in the relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaint, it is suspected that he is physically strong.
He could not take the necessary medication to combat his pain as it was not allowed in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number to date on January 25.
A number of people verified the findings using equipment and computer software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Meteorites might have been a source of water delivered to Earth, as well as organic residues that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, as space rocks collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed the bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He/She referred to the rumours as 'political blather and folly'.
It is speculated that you will campaign for president in 2016.
NextGen is how the FAA says it will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint an aircraft's location with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No designated transport facilities are provided, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parking and park-and-ride facilities are also not available at the stadium.
The fear of a lack of transport led to the game being forced to be played behind closed doors, without the team's supporters.
Research published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of new bird species in Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in America and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species have evolved in only two generations, although this process was believed to take a long time, due to interbreeding between Darwin's finches found only in that area, *Geospiza fortis*, and the cactus finches that migrated there, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be made into any shape. It can be rolled into thin shapes.
It can be drawn into fine wire, which can be twisted or woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It could be made thin, and then attached to another metal. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage extract.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the concentration of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which their electrons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Crumble the two dry powders, then, with clean, wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will interact with the outer layer, creating an odd sensation and forming a type of residue.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of sewage pipes were found in the houses of Minoan towns on Crete and in Santorini, Greece.
There were toilets in Egypt, Persia, and ancient China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled together.
When you call someone a thousand miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a signal and then transmits it back to Earth, almost instantaneously.
A satellite was launched into space using a rocket. Scientists used space telescopes because the atmosphere interferes with some of the light and our vision.
A large rocket over 100 feet tall is required to place a satellite or a telescope in space.
The wheel has transformed the world in amazing ways. The greatest thing it has done for us is to provide us with an easy and much faster way of transportation.
It has brought us the train, the car, and other means of transport.
Among them are small-sized carnivorous cats that prey on animals ranging from rabbits to antelopes.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that prey heavily on a wide variety of prey animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special task that each cat has which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are very social cats, living in large groups called a pride.
Herds are made up of one to three related males, along with three females and their young.
Women are often connected, forming a large family of sisters or daughters.
A pride of lions behaves like a pack of hyenas, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also in being dangerous to the animals they hunt.
An ultimate predator, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a leopard is not exactly like the roar of a lion, but it is almost like a shouted phrase of angry words.
Large American wild cats like to eat small animals. They will catch baboons, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all animals hunted by these cats are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that American big cats track and locate their prey by scent, sniffing for them on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move with great stealth. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms separates from the larger group it originated from (for example, when it crosses a mountain range or a river, or if it goes to a new island from which it cannot easily return), it will usually find itself in a different environment than the one they were in previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors. Therefore, the new community will require distinct qualities or adaptability to be more competitive than they previously needed.
The original creatures have not changed; they still need a way of life similar to their former one.
Over time, as the new group begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to look different from the other group.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will look so different that they cannot be called the same type.
We call this process speciation, which is simply the formation of new species. This speciation is an unpredictable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is, breathe out air).
Plants make their own food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot continue to live.
The Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except for other Mosasauruses.
Its long jaws, armed with over 70 razor-sharp teeth and additional ones above its mouth, meant that nothing that came near it could escape.
We don't know for sure, but it might have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a large dinosaur like a T.rex would not be able to withstand it.
While much of their food might have been familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of mouse called a dormouse.
One difference was that while poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, wealthy men preferred to have feasts together where they reclined on their sides while eating their food.
Ancient Roman cuisine would not have included foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in subsequent centuries.
For example, they had no maize, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People who offer sacrifices to gods and priests will attempt to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple court and an inner sanctuary where only the priest could enter.
Sometimes special triangular towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The summit of the tower was a special sacred place for the idol.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not very important.
Much of the time, the life of Hebrew families took place outdoors.
The woman was cooking in the yard, the stalls were tables set up facing the street. Stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. In the Norse Sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was outlawed in Iceland for murder, and when he traveled to the West, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite its discovery, the Eskimo people were still living there at that time.
Even though each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences among the peoples, monarchies, cultures, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever watched the movie National Treasure, you could swear that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even if something is written on the back of the book, it is not a treasure map.
The inscription on the back of the Declaration of Independence read "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text was at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, the parchment document (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches) was rolled up for preservation.
So, the thought was almost easily incorporated as a symbol.
The arrival of the Allied forces and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet liberated.
It was ruled by the French from Vichy. These were French people who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, and the attack was called “Operation Dragoon”.
In just two weeks, American and Free French soldiers extracted southern France from trade negotiations and have now turned towards Germany.
Human society is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word 'civilization' comes from the Latin word *civilis*, which means 'civil', related to the Latin *civis*, which means 'citizen', and *civitas*, which means 'city' or 'state', and that, in another way, also describes social complexity.
States precede nations. Societal culture refers to the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, an enduring traditional thread, and the effective dissemination of information.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving historical evidence and fail to be recognized as actual communities.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak government—with Congress as its sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and, because there was no national or judicial body, it relied on state officials, who often did not cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
Nor did it have the authority to bypass inter-state tax and customs laws.
The laws required all states to approve before it was amended, and the states regarded the central government as so unimportant that their representatives were always absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, netball, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, field hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the Northern regions, where Italians compete in international and Olympic Games.
Japan has approximately 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the world's 7th largest island nation!
Due to the numerous islands Japan possesses, it is often referred to as an "archipelago" because of its geographical location.
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European sailors passed by, writing the island's name as 'Ilha Formosa,' or 'the beautiful island.'
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, initiating the transformation of indigenous grain production and hiring Chinese laborers to work in the rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and established Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many buildings on the edge of the settlement were rebuilt to give visitors a better idea of how they originally looked.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored to its original state and the restoration is still continuing to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35mm, which is the same size as film at the end of the film era.
This is still done today, but most importantly, its aspect ratio is derived from the image capture settings of a digital camera.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of the width to the height of this format (dividing by twelve to get a simple whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format set, for example) are equal or nearly equal to this width-to-height ratio.
This three-part rule, which is often severely misused and commonly overlooked, is a simple guideline to create beauty while maintaining compositional order in the image.
It states that the most effective position for the main subject is where the lines intersect, dividing the image into three sections vertically and horizontally (see example).
Throughout this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which was rich and powerful, was scrutinized.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united the countries of Europe despite differences in languages and cultures.
Its power is everywhere, affecting everyone from the king to the common person.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are there for that reason.
The senior leaders of the church were in Rome for over a thousand years, and this accumulation of power and money led many to question whether this doctrinal principle was being upheld.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off supplies to both the military and civilians, even though this blockade violated international laws codified in numerous international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain is laying mines in continental waters to prevent ships from traversing the entire sea, posing dangers even to civilian vessels.
As there had been a limited response to this approach, Germany was expecting a similar reaction in its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of many citizens and nations were marked by a strong aversion to war and conflict, and by isolationism.
After witnessing the brutal and shocking acts of war during World War I, nations desired to prevent such a situation from recurring in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with only 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of denoting distinct eras; each Chinese ruling period or ruling family constituted a separate dynasty.
And between each dynasty were unstable years for the separate states. The most well-known period among these was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During this period, there were violent wars between rulers vying for supremacy.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the highest throne in the beautiful palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the implementation of a metric system, the transition from believing in absolute principles to supporting republicanism and nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
And after the Revolution, positions were open to all male applicants, which enabled the most ambitious and those who fared well to succeed.
This is similar to what happens in the army: instead of considering your race, they choose to determine the soldiers' caliber in order to give them ratings.
The French uprising inspired other oppressed working people from other countries to begin their own revolts.
Muhammad had a deep interest in spiritual matters. He would often go to a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has existed until now, provides a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
The cave, which sits atop one of the northern mountains of Mecca, is very far from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it even if you know it's there. Once it's inside the cave, it's completely isolated.
There is nothing visible above but a beautiful, clear sky and many surrounding mountains. Very little of the outside world is visible or audible when you are inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the pyramid structures built to honor a deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or 'Giza Necropolis' in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the greatest of all), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The 'upward angle' symbol looks like a V, whereas the 'downward angle' symbol looks like a block or a square with its bottom side missing.
Up means you must start from the end and then push the arrow, while down means you must start from the grip (that is, where you hold the arrow) and then bend the arrow.
The upper string tends to make a soft sound, whereas the lower string makes a more powerful and robust sound.
Feel free to write your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed diminishing markings are there for a musical reason, and therefore must be respected.
Terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Princess Elizabeth, on October 6, 1789, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
They were in the carriage, returning to Paris, surrounded by a screaming mob shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and the Queen to open the windows of their vehicle wide.
There was a time when a member of the rabble wanted to brandish the head of a royal guard who had been slain at Versailles before the terrified Queen.
The costs of the American imperial war when it conquered the Philippines were paid by the people of the Philippines themselves.
They were compelled to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover a large portion of the costs, and bond interest was lodged in the name of the Philippine government with Wall Street banking houses.
Clearly, the immense gains obtained through the relentless exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the fundamental interests of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the concept that created this organization.
The period in which events took place is often referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and was then followed by the Late Middle Ages, generally ending around 1500.
The belief in technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, ranging from the application of existing technologies or the notion that technology is simply necessary, to the strong conviction that human destiny is driven by a profound thought intrinsically linked to scientific laws and their technological manifestations.
Most definitions of technological determinism share two common ideas: that technological development itself follows a trajectory largely impervious to cultural or political influence, and that technology also inherently "influences" affected societies, rather than through social circumstances.
For example, someone might say that the car leads to the construction of roads.
However, roads connecting the entire country are not economically viable for just a few vehicles, so new strategies are being developed to reduce car ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to a high incidence of road accidents, which in turn prompts the development of new medical methods for treating injuries.
Romanticism exerts a significant influence on cultural moral beliefs, drawing from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the realm of Romanticism, the environment shapes individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with that place emerged; and these, being in harmony with the social environment, were superior to carelessly established laws.
Just as Paris is known as the capital of the modern world, Constantinople was regarded as the capital of Europe's subjects.
It is known as the place where magnificent things began around 400 A.D. and continued until approximately 1100 A.D.
Its condition deteriorated during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders also brought gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than those the Byzantine market had.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style developed during the medieval period from the 10th-11th centuries to the 14th century.
Initially, dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the lack of communication methods, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of that period was that, due to the crusaders, people started using buttons to fasten garments.
Subsistence farming is agriculture practiced to produce only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple method, often based on organic principles, utilizing local heirloom seeds with natural characteristics, combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, many farmers farmed for subsistence, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Diverse groups bring together people who feel overlooked by societal systems and allow them to build a sense of their humanity.
Cultures can be divisive based on the age, race, background, location, and/or gender of their members.
Features that distinguish a cultural subgroup can be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, location, or a combination of features.
Members of a subculture often express their membership by adopting a distinctive and representative style, which includes fashion, behavior, and way of speaking.
One of the many common ways used to explain the importance of social interaction is the formation of close bonds with a few individuals during childhood, where, unfortunately, through neglect or deliberate abuse, children are not accustomed to adults as they grow up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children were sequestered by other people (usually their parents); in some cases this abandonment of children was due to the parent's non-acceptance of the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or severe neglect before being abandoned or running away.
Some are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by a non-human animal, a feral child exhibits behavior (within practical limitations) almost identical to that of the animal that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards people.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, badges do more.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a tool that provides assistance to individuals learning new things, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be digital and physical; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold, but so is the little paperclip person in Microsoft Office.
Computer simulations are integrated into the software and are designed to prompt, stimulate, and explain processes that students might have found difficult to work through on their own.
Children are placed in care homes for many reasons, such as neglect, abuse, and exploitation.
No child should grow up in a wrong environment, without love, care, and education, but it happens.
We believe that the Child Welfare Program will be a place of safety for these children.
Our process for orphaned children must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
An orphanage must provide the necessities that were not available in their previous home.
The Internet combines features of mass communication and interaction with others.
The unique features of the Internet led to an increased scope regarding its use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" were again identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when examining website viewer response behavior.
The use of the video system has led to important insights in the interpretation of very subtle expressions, including facial movements lasting only seconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can detect when a person is lying by accurately deciphering subtle facial cues.
Oliver Sacks, in his Presidential Address paper, noted that people who have difficulty understanding speech due to brain injury are able to accurately perceive sincerity.
It was also suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior could be shared with animals like domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two categories of variation: hidden and revealed.
Mutation creates new genetic variation, and selection removes them from the expressed variations.
The variation in segregation and integration fluctuated between the two categories in each generation.
In the wild, it is difficult for an animal with a human-like digestive system to meet its amino-acid requirements from the available plants.
Furthermore, failure to do so has extremely serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and premature death.
Easily accessible plant sources would be proteins found in leaves and stems, but these are difficult for us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide high-quality proteins with essential amino acids.
When all things are considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" for themselves in a way almost identical to that of baboons on the plains today.
Interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep time and falling asleep again quickly thereafter (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using an alarm clock that rings at a relatively low volume to gently rouse you without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm while still overcome by drowsiness, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other methods based on the natural cycle include consuming plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces one to wake up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace one finds is inversely related to the amount of stress in their body and spirit.
The lower the stress, the more optimal life's potential becomes. Everyone can achieve perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can succeed. The only thing standing in the way of achieving this goal is our mindset and self-doubt.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but is expanded by the Mahayana path of compassion and many practices derived from Indian Yoga.
Fundamentally, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It combines Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the power of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga exercises, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
Tibetan Deity Yoga Meditation Centre. Through visualising various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the light of being is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and America. With the end of the war, the clash of ideologies, policies, and cultures led to the countries becoming adversaries.
After two years of war, former allies are now enemies and have started the Cold War.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and be truly fought, with engaged forces, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, Poland's defending forces had already been attacked, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered, forming the Belarussian and Ukrainian forces after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international peace treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is the most efficient way to move a large number of people and cargo across oceans.
The role of sailors was generally to ensure that your country maintained the ability to transport its people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting your enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were trying to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using U-boats, was trying to prevent this movement.
If the Allied nations had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain, just as it had done with the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep animals as an easy way to obtain milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were typically kept with a herd that grazed in the hills or pastures. They were regularly tended by herders, usually children or young people, who were the same familiar herders. This method of herding is still practiced today.
Wagonways were built in England from the 16th century.
Although wagonways were made of parallel timbers, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and to haul a larger load than on the rougher roads of the day.
Railroad ties were primarily designed to connect the rails. Over time, however, it became apparent that the rail would work better if it had a steel head on top.
This was a common process, but the metal was chafing the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron railway line came into use.
The first known method of travel is walking, and people began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning 'upright man').
Their successors, Australopithecus, did not generally walk fully upright.
The earliest evidence of bipedalism is found in the fossilized bones of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been bipedal much earlier, seven million years ago.
We can begin to live without harming our environment, join environmental campaigns, and even become advocates to some extent to reduce future suffering.
In many cases, it's merely a remedy for treating the symptoms of an illness. However, if we don't want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem and address it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed immensely due to human advancements in science and technology, and problems have escalated due to overpopulation and humanity's exploitative way of life.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, the handwritten document was signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and then sent by Secretary Charles Thompson to John Dunlap's nearby printing shop.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the “Dunlap broadsides”.
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon at Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10,
The 25 Dunlap broadsides are known to be the oldest existing copies of the document. The original handwritten copy no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs continued to live and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider birds to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on processing input data in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or, when using technical jargon, bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are often so general that a quick diagnosis cannot be made.
The strongest indicator of ingested poison could be the presence of open medicine containers or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the label for first aid instructions for that poison.
The term 'isilwanyakazane' is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term originates from the long-standing association with bed bugs, which are creatures known for living by feeding on human bodies.
Both predatory bugs and common bugs inhabit nests, adapted to live in the nest or in the dwelling place of an animal whose blood they suck.
Across America, there are an estimated 400,000 people reported to have Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A loving couple may realize that raising a child would not be in their best interest, nor in the child's.
These couples can choose to make arrangements for their child to be adopted by others.
When adopting a parentless child, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The primary aim of science is to discover how the world operates by applying the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides much scientific research.
Experimentation, however, is not singular; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more sound hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations and guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on ancient writings and, especially, on the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's scientific ideas were accepted, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself drifting from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Most of the periodicity observed in physiology and behavior is generally primarily dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their regulation by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely reactions to external cues, have been reported in many living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks self-renew their energy to continue operating in a free-running environment even for an unimaginable period of time.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments by labeling phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different and varied effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic segment, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Genetic changes in germ cells are the only ones that can be passed on to children, although changes elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourist destinations attract people who enjoy visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wild animals.
Examples of activities done in the area include hunting, fishing, photography, bird-watching, and visiting parks and learning about living things.
For example, visiting, taking photos, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns by car to go to their workplaces, and they are passed by others whose workplaces are in the very places they have just come from.
In this powerful mode of transport, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transport system based on small vehicles.
Science now indicates that this presence of carbon has undermined the environment from one of its most stable states, which supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you'd be surprised to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is there something more important happening?
Vehicle movement is a study of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and their interaction.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with complete certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a fairly consistent way; thus, traffic patterns tend to be similar and can almost be mathematically modeled.
To better model traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three key factors: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship assists in the planning, design, and implementation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first flying animals. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Many insects benefit from being able to fold their wings behind their bodies.
This gives them a little more room in small hiding places from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the Solar System orbited the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed differently; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
This seems logical, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the World. It has more than 8 times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the World, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of streams.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and architectural sophistication.
The New Kingdom in ancient Egypt held great reverence for the monuments of their predecessors, which were over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest sovereign state in the world and the least populous country.
The Vatican City uses Italian laws and official languages.
Italian is also the everyday language used by the majority of those working in the region, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People were aware of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from ancient times, as these could be found in nature in their native form and were very easy to extract using ancient tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, believed that all things were composed of a mixture of one or more of the four basic elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was almost like the four existing categories of matter (categorized similarly): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also held the view that they could transform into new substances that constitute what we observe.
An alloy is fundamentally a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Indeed, there are other metals like silver and gold.
You can also have mixed alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the world is made of elements. All elements are made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so much so that trillions could fit on the dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Sadly, as new writing methods have emerged, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and function.
People now write messages on computer screens, no longer needing to approach a pencil sharpener.
One might wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
A fission bomb operates on a system where it takes energy and combines it into a nucleus, along with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy wagon uphill. Splitting the nucleus then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they tend to decay when slightly perturbed or even when undisturbed.
The Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The layer is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thin under the sea and thick under the plains.
There might be many dark areas on the moon's surface on that side because the crust is thin. It was easy for the hot molten rock to rise to the surface.
The thinking behind human change focuses on things that motivate people or touch their hearts.
These concepts suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been suppressed as they grow into adulthood.
These ideas explore what makes some people want the things they want and what factors in their environment will cause them to do or not do other things.
Two popular motivational theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Simply put, two types of behavior can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One tries to be "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles when required to make unpopular decisions, discipline employees, conduct performance reviews, allocate work, and hold people accountable for their job responsibilities.
On the other hand, a person transforms into someone unrecognizable, who feels as if they must change everything the group was doing and make it their own.
After all, leaders bear the true responsibility for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often causes a division between leaders and the entire team.
Realistic-looking groups are treated with similar aesthetic principles as traditional groups, but there is a subtle difference.
Online group members often serve as a communication hub for the core members of the physical group.
They generally have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams can meet according to different local time zones, which might not be understood by local management.
The existence of a "real invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a distinctive feature of a non-physical team.
The invisible group is the management group to whom each member reports. The invisible group sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to undertake the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One objective for implementing the concepts of a learning organization is to develop strategies.
If all resources are effectively utilized within the organization's operational departments, innovation and creativity can emerge.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new strategic approach that focuses on customer needs.
Before an organization can develop strategies, leaders must foster a culture of strategic planning, shared knowledge, and member education.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a high level of performance.
Neuroscience data provides concrete evidence of a theoretical method for studying cognition. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The comparative integration of the neuroscience of brain disorders and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some cognitive functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to observe and explore brain structures and processes previously unseen.
This provides us with a lot of information and components to build simulation machines that help us understand how the mind works.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it constitutes a very important part of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and machine operation of intelligence.
Robotics research involves making machines automatically perform tasks that require human thought.
Examples include control, planning, and scheduling; the ability to handle troubleshooting and customer inquiries; and recognition by hand, voice, and face.
Such things are distinct principles, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and warfare, just as they have been built into several home computer operating systems and video games.
School trips have become a major part of the class. Often, the teacher would like to take his/her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology provides a solution for virtual school trips. Learners can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or enjoy the beauty of art while remaining seated with their class.
Sharing a school trip experience is arguably one of the best ways to reflect on the journey and share what happened with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the Nation's Capital; every year the websites are redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an archive.
Blogs can help students with their writing. While students often begin their blogging with poor writing and spelling, the presence of an audience often changes that.
As readers are often very critical, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing to withstand criticism.
And blogging "compels students to have a deeper understanding of the world around them." The need to nurture the interest of readers encourages students to be insightful and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to learn beyond the typical school day.
The proper way to use blogs "can empower students to be more creative and critical thinkers; students can explain their positions within the context of others' writings and express their opinions on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful, bilingual capital city, with many art institutions and museums showcasing Canadian historical items and other diverse collections.
Far south of Niagara Falls and stretching north lies the undisturbed home of Muskoka's natural beauty and beyond.
All these things and more emphasize Ontario being regarded by outsiders as Canada itself.
Many places far to the north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A demographic comparison that might surprise many: There are more people of African descent living in America than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is immense, and it is a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Many of the small islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as a luxurious coastal resort.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and the Comorians and the Mayotte loved it very much.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north it is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female visitors say they are married, regardless of whether they are actually married or not.
It also helps to wear a ring (but not one that looks expensive).
Women must be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they might perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stand strong when you say no to men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a conveniently located port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it completely after the 1755 earthquake.
The King of Morocco rebuilt this city as Daru l-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Near the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, smoking pipes, and many decorative trinkets, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a city in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda, that attracts tourists.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by hot lava from Mount Nyiragongo, which covered many of the city's roads, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any travel outside Goma should be thoroughly researched to understand the conflict situation in North Kivu province.
The city also serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the least expensive mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
When using a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma, the usual (local) fare for a short ride is around 500 Congolese Francs.
Combined with its inaccessibility, 'Timbuktu' has come to be used as a metaphor for remote, exotic places.
Today, Timbuktu is a dilapidated city, although its reputation makes it popular with tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS series, 'Wonders of the African World'.
The city is completely different from other cities in the country, because it has a much more Arabic atmosphere than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 natural zones, each with diverse wildlife.
It is one of the most visited places in South Africa and is regarded as the best-known site within the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily fees for those inside, as well as park entrance fees.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry into a selection of South African parks or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name, and it is the place many visitors consider their primary destination.
The parade of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline is likened to a dazzling bar chart, made visible by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave this island and go to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Much of Hong Kong Island's development is concentrated on newly reclaimed land and the northern shore.
This is the place the British colonizers took as their own, so if you want to see evidence of the area's colonial past, this is the right place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest contiguous mangrove forest, extending approximately 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps — they comprise some of the last remaining areas of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², a third of which is covered by wetlands and mudflats.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a habitat for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are now Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the central district bus station (across the river) all day, although many, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since regional buses often get full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Many villages are served by small, comfortable, and sturdy Japanese Coaster buses.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River, connecting the towns of Oiapque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, are 378 meters long and have two roads 3.50 meters wide.
The remaining vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened for vehicular traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's immigration inspection facilities are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were a notable indigenous group with a heritage in what is now called Eastern Paraguay, living as hunters and acquiring food through cultivation.
The Chaco region was home to some indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies", came into being through the union of Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve its strong traditional character and its identity.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest annual competition takes place in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Minor competitions and games can also be seen here at certain times of the year.
To find news on competitions and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), its value is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island in Stanley, opposite the FIC store to the west.
British Pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and United States dollars are also usually accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be taken; check with the owners in advance to find out what form of payment is acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo is in the Southern Hemisphere, it's summer there when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located near the tropics; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winters can be very harsh: temperatures may drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific 'rainy' or 'winter' seasons: the rainfall level remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to people, wild animals are nevertheless not tame and must not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolf-like animals such as coyotes, and 25 yards/meters away from other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may appear, American bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attacking.
Every year, many visitors are injured because they did not keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Furthermore, note that the smell attracts bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the official capital of Samoa from 1959.
The harbor was the scene of a terrible naval disaster in 1889, where a fierce storm struck, preventing seven German, American, and British ships from leaving the harbor.
All the ships sank, except for one British ship. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peace meeting in the town resulted in the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There is much diversity, because Auckland spans two harbors. The most popular are in three locations.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the Auckland North region) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Several sandy coves offer safe swimming, amply shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive areas are on Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with various shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is ‘Uhamba Phambili’; it is not a complex beer, but it is delicious and refreshing. Another local beer is called “i-Manta”.
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines could be better.
Water from the public tap is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easily available if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the idea of coffee 'with steamed milk' is unfamiliar. A small cup is an 'espresso', a cappuccino comes topped with cream (not foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian standard. Fruit drinks are expensive but very good.
Many trips to the coral reef are undertaken throughout the year, and accidents resulting from any of these reef-related causes are uncommon.
Nevertheless, take the advice of the authorities, follow all instructions and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are present near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside these times.
Sharks are not inherently aggressive; yet they rarely attack people. Most sharks fear people and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not commonly inhabit the ocean; their main habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Travel companies often have discounts and deals with certain hotels, although you can also book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel company.
Travel companies offer a combination of items including breakfast, airport transfers, or a combined flight and hotel package.
They can hold a place for you if you still need time to think or wish to sort out things related to your trip (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests, however, must be submitted to the travel company first and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and many attendees consider it a necessary part of the experience.
If you want to see what's happening up close, you'll need to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage might end, there could be parts of the festival that continue to play music until very late at night.
Some festivals have dedicated campsites for families with young children.
When crossing the North Baltic in winter, look out for the wooden shelter, as walking on the ice can cause nasal discomfort for those most susceptible.
A Saint Petersburg cruise includes the city. Cruise passengers are expected to meet visa requirements (check terms).
Casinos typically make efforts to ensure that visitors spend as much time and money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and it can be difficult to find the exits.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and on the premises.
Some venues serve alcohol. However, drunkenness impairs the mind, and all serious gamblers understand the importance of remaining clear-headed.
Anyone who drives in high places or over mountain passes must expect the presence of frost, snow, or bone-chilling cold.
On roads with ice and snow, travel is slowed down and you cannot drive as you would on dry pavement.
If there is snow with wind, enough snow could fall to get you stuck for just a short while.
Visibility must not be impaired by falling or sprayed snow or ice, or by moisture or ice on the vehicle's window.
On the other hand, snowy or icy conditions are common in many countries, and vehicles travel without disruption almost all year round.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's biggest tourist attraction and are very popular with visitors.
The word 'safari' is commonly used to refer to a cross-country journey to see impressive African wild animals, especially in the plains.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, like to approach vehicles, and good viewing equipment will allow you to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are wary, and you will see them better with binoculars.
Trekking (also known as "bushwalking," "walking safari," or "hiking") involves long journeys on foot, which can last a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, having hosted them in 1964.
If you booked a flight and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from late March, many coronavirus cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Many event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, and standard tickets are priced at ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available for loan, even if one is not in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you're not wearing expensive, ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric overheat (which could make it shrink, or in extreme cases, disintegrate).
There are many ways to purify water, some of which are most effective under certain challenging conditions.
In some places boiling water for one minute is enough, in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter animal diseases that are unfamiliar to them in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, be a nuisance, or even worse, make us sick, spread toxins, or spread diseases.
Diseases that are infectious by nature, or dangerous animals capable of severely harming or killing a person, are not typically suitable as pets.
Purchasing tax-free goods is an opportunity to buy items exempt from various taxes, including sales tax, in specific locations.
Travelers going to high-tax countries can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmont creates very difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which constantly passes through uninhabited wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, stay alert: very steep areas, narrow roads, and dangerous bends abound.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than on the preceding and following sections — usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and paying close attention to them is even more important.
Surprisingly, however, the mobile phone app is much more powerful here than many other trail apps, for example, those for the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked dishes are actually excellent, and in Bavaria, they are rich and diverse, much like those of its southern neighbour, Austria.
Baked fruit dishes are common, with cooked apples used in baked goods throughout the year, along with cherries and plums that appear in summer.
Much of German baked food also contains almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want a small but rich doughnut, try what is locally called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish derived from herbs and spices, combined together perhaps with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "wet" or "dry" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the central regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in stews; in South India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a term that encompasses many types of local cuisine found throughout the country.
But, unless otherwise specified, the term usually refers to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely found throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of lightly spiced dishes, where the prominent seasoning for Javanese people is peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and other aromatic spices.
Stirrups are devices that support the rider's feet, hanging on either side of a horse's saddle.
They provide stability to the rider but can pose safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet becoming trapped in them.
If a rider is thrown by a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this danger, a few safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, many riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, pointed sole.
Furthermore, some horse saddles, particularly English saddles, feature safety release mechanisms that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle when pulled backwards by a falling rider.

Downhill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending a snow-covered area with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a primary travel activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan all their trips to ski in a particular location.
The concept of skiing is very old — cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Recreational downhill skiing dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 a recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing with a pack: This is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, and ski mountaineering.
It is related but does not encompass the alpine style of trekking or mountaineering, which was later adopted by others in rocky terrain and requires more robust ice axes and boots.
Consider skiing as a comparable method to mountaineering.
In ideal conditions, you will be able to travel considerably further than walking – but only very rarely can you achieve skiing speed in unusual places without a heavy pack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to several countries would mean applying for a visa and going through multiple passport checks.
The Schengen Area, however, functions to some extent as a single country in this regard.
If you live in this area, you can usually cross the borders without your passport being checked again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each of the Schengen member countries, which saves time, money, and the effort of filling out forms.
There is no definition whatsoever that would classify these manufactured products as modern. Tax organisations define items that are over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the average age can be shorter in regions like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products may be described as antiques, although they are less common than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding this activity is also important to others who have different occupations.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were fully involved in reindeer herding, but lived by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.

Books and magazines about life in the wild are common, but books about war zones are few.
Cruise passengers planning gender reassignment surgery overseas must ensure they have the appropriate documents for their return journey.
The acknowledgement by governments to issue people gender-neutral (X) passports or updated documents that match their preferred name and gender identity.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents is variable.
Searches in screening areas have become very widespread since September 11, 2001.
Individuals undergoing gender reassignment surgery should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity fully intact.
Backwash is the returning flow from waves that come from the ocean, usually on rocks or similar features.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow concentrates in a few deep sections, and a rapid current can form there in the deep water.
Many deaths occur due to the exhaustion from trying to swim backwards against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you are out of the water current, swimming back is usually no longer difficult.
Try to understand where you are unhindered and whether, depending on your abilities and if you have been spotted, you would like to wait for rescue.
The abuse experienced at home is more significant than the abuse encountered when visiting an unfamiliar place (thus reducing happiness), it takes time, and it can gradually escalate.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their own native culture.
When you return home from abroad, you will need to adjust to a new culture and some of the habits you may have lost since leaving your home country.
When you travel abroad for the first time, people may be patient and understanding, knowing that visitors need to adjust when they arrive in a new country.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also important for those returning home.
A 3D sound and light show is one of the most fascinating attractions in the children's area.

Other locations include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a large volcanic caldera, still active, forms a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region in the south of the Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Sentinel Mountains converge at an expanse, and then converge again to form the Ellsworth Mountains range, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, has Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, whose peak, Mount Vinson, is 4892 m high.
In remote areas, without a functioning phone network, a satellite phone might be the only device you can use.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and in direct line of sight with the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by vessels, including for professional work, and for long-distance trips requiring data and voice.
Your local telephone company should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this system.
An increasingly popular way for those planning to take a gap year from studying is to travel and learn.
This is very popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a year before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a post-school gap year program abroad actually enhances your opportunities to pursue higher education back in your home country.
Typically, there will be a tuition and registration fee for these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' boasts thousands of islands, found both in its inland lakes and its offshore archipelagos.
In a cluster of islands and lakes, you don't need a boat.
Although offshore islands and the largest lakes are large enough to carry any luxury vessel, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for seven or eight people.
This is similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it's quite different (e.g., in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruise ships include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit a historical city for a few full days, returning to sleep on the ship each night.
If you only visit the coast using a short cruise, you will not require a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise ships feature Berlin, Germany, in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is very far from the sea and the city visit is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.

Freight companies are well compensated for shipping goods quickly. Generally, time is of the essence for business documents, goods purchased for resale, or other materials needed for urgent repairs.
In some ways, larger companies have their own aircraft, but in other ways, smaller companies have faced problems.
Even if all the items had been sent by plane, it would still take days to offload the cargo and clear customs.
The easiest way to get it in quickly is to send it as checked baggage. Airline rules won't allow them to send cargo without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The most obvious way to fly in a first-class or business class cabin is to pay a lot of money for that privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, this doesn't come cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay four times more than the standard business economy price, and eleven times more than the basic level!
Generally, there's no point even looking for discounts on business or premium seats on a direct flight from A to B.
Airline companies knew well that there was a certain core group of air travelers willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of reaching a destination quickly and comfortably, and they charged them accordingly.
The capital city of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.

Similarly, men must wear trousers that cover their knees.
This can also be borrowed from the items in the entrance area, but those items are not cleaned after each user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing this skirt. One size fits all men!
