While one experimental vaccine appears to reduce deaths from Ebola, so far, no drugs have been definitively shown to be effective in treating existing infections.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but official studies showed it had less benefit than hoped for in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, Zmapp was used as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics accepts the letter from the US Olympic Committee and acknowledges the critical need of the Olympic family to foster a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, could be best served by moving forward with meaningful changes within our organization, instead of revoking charters.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that will hopefully clarify how abuse of the scale so courageously described by Larry Nassar’s survivors could have gone undetected for so long, and embraces important and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have one goal — to make the sport of gymnastics, and others, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.
Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as his advisor and also for the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say this animal's fur was reddish-brown on the upper side and pale or carrot-colored on the underside.
That finding also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers discovered that the rachis is likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flight but were used for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not the soft downy feathers of a chick.
Researchers suggested that, even if this is a small dinosaur's tail, the sample shows mature feathers and not downy feathers.
A car bomb that exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to convective flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the stars become in terms of magnetic variability.

The work done was primarily theoretical, but a program was developed to simulate the observed views of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was searching for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts its influence on Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way influence the fluid of the Sagittarius sign.
Scientists were able to conclude that a black hole affects another black hole in the same usual way.
This theory states that much dark matter surrounding the galaxy is near the galaxy in a sort of halo, and is made of many small particles.
TV reports show white smoke coming from the plant.

It's colder than nearby areas during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters seclude themselves in a booth, then they place a pre-printed ballot showing their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officers confirm the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law instead incorporates that case into the code. Strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are added except those of counted and approved voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were rescuing the driver from a red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Edinburg Sheriff Court on charges of killing his son.
He is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any witness testimony might be severely compromised because his picture has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law operates differently, and the courts have viewed the publication of images as discriminatory.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says "journalists appear to put themselves at risk by publishing photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which oversees prosecutions, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until charges are laid.
The document, according to rumors, will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a ten-year extension of its military presence in the valley once the agreement is signed, while the PA is agreeing to a withdrawal of that presence for only five years.
The test subjects in the additional experiment to control pests were to be supervised by guards, as the experiment would be monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In cooperation with NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were registered under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four sharpshooters selected for the first shooting operation received full training and safety instructions.
Martelly swore in the new interim Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests which began in October.
The protests, which sometimes turn violent, were sparked by the lack of elections, with one having been overdue since 2011.
Approximately 60 incidents of defective iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burn injuries.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to that equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them about 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company said "were not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very disappointing."
An earthquake hit Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office stated that no damage was reported in the nation.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a Tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has kidnapped Hong Kong tourists by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several captives have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, just like the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the old woman's place because she needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was attacked by gunfire.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and joined the medical profession.
She learned to be a midwife and started working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature labor in his spare time.
His/Her research showed that if a hormone were administered, it would increase the rate of growth of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found the plane's 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Her fellow boxers also mourned Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. Unique just like her. A strong woman.”
Justin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was as weak as me… maybe even more… love her and you’ll miss her… hopefully she is in a good place.”
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents share this opinion, calling for Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
In the overall vote, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his/her complaints, his/her health has been in doubt.
He couldn't take the necessary medicines to relieve his pain because they are banned in Sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software by early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were a source of transporting water to the Earth, along with carbon-containing substances that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, because comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship early this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called that rumor "blather and political foolishness."
He considered running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system which the Federal Aviation Administration claims would allow planes to use shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel every year, and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike traditional ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport will be laid on and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available there.
Concerns about a lack of transport raised the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the creation of a new bird species in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was believed to take much longer, because of interbreeding between native Darwin's finches, Geospiza fortes, and immigrant large cactus finches, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be formed into various shapes. It can be rolled into small pieces.
It can be drawn out into a thin wire, which can be spun and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
It can be made thinner, and affixed to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the chemical's acidity or alkalinity.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped (because hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders, then, with clean, damp hands, form them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will come into contact with the outer layers, which you will feel as different, and form a type of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a modern toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in the houses of Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Also, there were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women mingled together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a signal, then reflects it back down, almost instantly.
A satellite was launched into space using a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
You don't need a large rocket over 100 feet tall to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to provide us with easy and fast transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transport.
Below it are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including beloved free-roaming cats) that feed on abundant small prey, such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a specific role that each cat holds and which prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are among the most social felines, and they live in large groups called prides.
Lion prides consist of between one and three related adult males, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
Women typically bond closely with each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave like wolf packs or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) behaviorally, and are also dangerous to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, leap very far, and pull with a strength five times that of a strong man.
The leopard is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, tigers, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A leopard's roar isn't like a lion's mighty roar, but is more like a scolding sentence with shouted words.
Wild cats like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that wild cats hunt are smaller than them.
Scientists think that wild cats track and hunt prey by smell, sniffing to find where they were on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move very silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the larger population they originated from (for instance, by crossing mountains or a river, or moving to a foreign island in such a way that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in environments different from their original habitat.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so a new population will need different elements or practices to be strong competitors than they needed before.
The original number has never changed, they still need the very same original methods.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to appear more and more different from the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, those two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a crucial part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was a large predator of that time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasauruses.
Its massive jaws contained over 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional set on the roof of its mouth, meaning that anything it encountered would not escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps it could have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a big dinosaur like T. rex would not stand a chance against it.
While many of their foods are familiar to us, the Romans had their fair share of surprising or unusual banquet items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of mouse called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their food seated on chairs, rich people liked to have banquets together where they would recline on their side while eating their food.
Ancient Roman meals would not have included foods that entered Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of that deity.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and priests would try to attend to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every castle had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes special tower-shaped pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of a temple.
The upper part was the holy abode of God.
In the heat of the Middle East, a house wasn't very important.
Much of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; the stalls were just open counters facing the road. Stones were used to build the road.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was sold at a very high price.
Greenland had few people. In Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further West, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, rulers, traditions, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've watched the movie National Treasure, you might think the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". That inscription is on the bottom part of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that that large parchment document (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches) was folded for storage.
So, it's possible that the quote was added as a sign.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, but the south was still not liberated.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied Forces attacked southern France, an attack called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization is a collective culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *civilis*, which means civil, related to the Latin *civis*, meaning citizen, and *civitas*, meaning city or city-state, and which in some way describes the size of a society.
City-states preceded nations. A civilized culture signifies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a cultural footprint that persists over time and equitable distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and failing to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government – with the US Congress being its only part – under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to levy taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce its laws. 
Nor did it have the authority to disregard laws and inter-state tariffs.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian football team, along with the German football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, field hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the Northern regions, where Italians compete in international and Olympic games.
Japan owns nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), thus making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the island groups Japan possesses, it is often referred to, geographically, as an 'archipelago'.
Taiwan's history began way back in the 15th century, when passing English sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, introducing changes in grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Many houses on the edges of those complex buildings were rebuilt to give tourists a better view of how they were originally.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35 millimeters, which was the main film size in the era of classic cinema.
It is still produced to this day, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing: it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The dimensional ratio of this structure (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is then said to be 3:2.
Many common structures (the APS family of structures, for example) are equal to or approximately equal to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and ridiculed, is a simple guide that creates compositional strength while maintaining a sense of order in a picture.
It is said that the place with the greatest impact on the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into vertical and diagonal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which was wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound the states of Europe together despite having different languages and traditions.
His all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources are there specifically for that purpose.
The church's central authority was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money in one place led many to question whether this ideology was truly being followed.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy was effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated international law which is generally accepted and codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the sea, thereby endangering even neutral ships.
Since there was little response to this strategy, Germany expected similar responses to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of the public and many nations was one of reconciliation and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and brutality of war during the First World War, nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to take a job at the Edison company in New York City.
He arrived in America with just 4 pennies, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each phase of China or each family that was in power was a specific dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty was an unstable period of divided states. Most famous among these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms of Han and Jin.
During these periods, fierce battles took place between noblemen fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest era in the history of Ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest seat in the Xi'an palace.
There are many social and political impacts such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from dictatorship to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, positions were open to all male applicants, thereby allowing the ambitious and successful to thrive.
Similarly for soldiers, because instead of military authority depending on social class, it now depends on merit.
The French Revolution also spurred many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply fascinated by things beyond this ordinary life. He would often visit a cave that came to be known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has endured through time, offers a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely cut off from the world.
In fact, it's never easy to find, even if one knew it existed. Once you enter the cave, you are completely cut off.
Nothing else can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains surrounding it. Very little of this world can be seen or heard inside this cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE is one of the largest buildings constructed in honor of the deceased Pharaohs.
Giza Hill, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the main pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper bracket" symbol looks like a V, and the "lower bracket" symbol looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
The upper bow usually produces a soft sound, while the lower bow is powerful and more stable.
Feel free to write your markings in pencil, but remember that the printed slurs are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, filled with fear, were forced on October 6, 1789, to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled towards Paris, surrounded by a screaming crowd loudly hurling threats at the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their car windows.
At one point, a member of the mob waved the head of a slain royal guard at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The military expenditures for American imperialism in its conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Undoubtedly, the immense profits resulting from the long-term oppression of the Filipino people constituted the primary income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templar, one must understand the context that led to the formation of the order.
The period in which the events occurred is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th Centuries (1000-1300 A.D.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention end around 1500.
Technical classification is a concept that encompasses various views in practice, from technological pressure, or technological development, to the notion that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism incorporate two general views: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has 'effects' on societies that are inherent, rather than socially determined.
For example, one might say that cars lead to the development of roads.
However, the national road system is not economically viable for only a few vehicles, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to many road accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new medical techniques for repairing broken bodies.
Romanticism had a major aspect of cultural shaping influenced by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the Roman context, geography shaped people, and over time, geographically-related customs and traditions emerged. These, being in harmony with societal conditions, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known for being a center of luxury that began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its condition deteriorated during the twelfth century, especially due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were of higher value than those offered by Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the transfer of the Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period from the 10th and 11th centuries to the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was influenced by Byzantine cultures from the east.
However, due to poor communication channels, Western trends lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time, as a result of the crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is practiced to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses heirloom and native seeds for the specific area, along with crop rotation or simple alternative methods to improve yields.
Historically, many farmers engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
A subculture brings together like-minded people who feel alienated by social norms and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
Characteristics that make a subculture unique may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, geographical, or a combination of elements.
Members of subcultures often signal their membership through distinctive styles, including fashion, behavior, and language.
One of the most popular methods used to show the importance of interaction is to use a few sad examples of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not engaged with by adults as they were growing up.
Such children are called "cruel" or violent. Some cruel children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in other cases, this abandonment of children resulted from parents denying a significant mental or physical deficiency in the child.
It's possible that unconnected children went through severe abuse or trauma in their childhood before being released or escaping.
Some are accused of bestiality; others are said to live by themselves in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limitations) almost exactly like those of the specific caregiver animal, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make education easier and more interesting, ingenuity goes a step further.
Training methods are not a way of studying, but a service that provides assistance to people who are experiencing new learning situations, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Platforms can be abstract as well as tangible; in other words, a teacher is a kind of platform, but so is that paper clip character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Platforms have been integrated into the program to prompt inquiry, encourage engagement, and explain procedures that might have been a significant challenge for the student to handle independently.
Children are placed in care services for many other reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to even abduction.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that doesn't educate them, nurture them, or instruct them, but they do.
We consider the Foster Care System a safe place for these children.
Children's homes should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, a sound education, and a reliable healthcare system.
Children's homes should provide all these needs that were lacking in the homes they were originally taken from.
The Internet blends mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to further measurements concerning usage and satisfying methods.
For example, "learning" and "collaboration" are suggested as important motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and "ongoing relationships" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational factors when they investigated audience response on websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for fractions of a second.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by accurately interpreting subtle cues.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay 'The President's Speech', demonstrated how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess reality.
Even he suggests that such an ability to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals like domesticated dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: recessive and expressed.
Mutations increase morphological variations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
The dynamic changes of segregation and re-mixing back and forth between those two pools for each generation.
Outside in the savanna, it's difficult for large animals with a human-like digestive system to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant material.
Furthermore, failure to do so has severe consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
Easily accessible plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for high-level mammals like us to digest unless they are cooked.
Comparatively, animal foods (termites, ants, eggs) are not only easily digested, but also provide high-quality proteins that contain essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way as those savanna monkeys do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep and falling back asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done by using an alarm clock that isn't too loud, to make you aware without completely waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other chronobiological options involve heavy fluid intake (especially water or tea, a common practice) before bed, which necessitates waking up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely related to the level of stress within their body and soul.
The lower the pull, the more positive the inherent life force. Everyone has the ability to find greater peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve understanding. The one thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded by the Mahayana path of compassion and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and an all-embracing path of love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, the repetition of words or sounds, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan thought is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is awakened.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the war's end, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to the separation of the nations.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would actually be waged by proxy forces, in theatres of war from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses were broken, and the only hope was to return and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army poured in and established the borders of Belarus and Ukraine after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport large quantities of goods was the best way to transport masses of people and much cargo by sea.
The inherent role of the Navy has been to ensure that your country has the ability to transport its people and goods, while simultaneously preventing your enemy from moving their people and goods.
One of the most famous recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
Meanwhile, German forces, using submarines, were trying to block this traffic.
If the Union had fallen, Germany might have conquered Britain, just as it had conquered Europe.
It appears that goats began to be domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
In general, domestic goats began to be herded in roaming groups in the mountains or other grazing areas, supervised by guardians who were often children or young people, much like the familiar shepherds. These herding methods are still in use today.
Horse-drawn vehicles were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the roadways were laid with parallel logs, they allowed horses to pull them faster and haul considerably larger loads on the poor roads of the day.
Railway sleepers were introduced fairly early to hold the rails in place. However, as time went on, it was discovered that the rails would work better if a piece of metal were placed on top.
This became a custom, but the iron caused the wooden wheels of the wagons to deteriorate.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railways were introduced.
The first known form of transport was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago, after the emergence of upright humans.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not normally walk upright.
Bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it's possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two feet approximately seven million years ago.
We can start living as good friends of the environment, join environmental movements, and even become activists to reduce future hardships to some extent.
This is like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't just want a short-term solution, then we ought to get to the root of the problems and eradicate them.
It is very clear that the world has changed greatly due to human advancements in science and technology, and problems have escalated because of overpopulation and wasteful human lifestyles.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Continental Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks to John Dunlap's print shop.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, which are now known as “the Dunlop Tracts.”
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap copies bearing traces of attacks, which are known to exist, are the oldest available copies of that document. The original handwritten copy does not exist.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Nearly all computers used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits, in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best sign of internal poisoning could be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for that poison.
The word 'bug' is used by entomologists in the formal usage of this group of insects.
This word comes from a long-standing familiarity with bedbugs, which are very skilled at feeding on humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs have experience living in their host's nest or dwelling.
Across all of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple might decide it's not in their best interest, or their child's best interest, to raise their child.
This couple can choose to make a parenting plan for their child.
When a child is placed into care, birth parents terminate their parental rights so that other parents can raise that child.
The main goal of Science is to ascertain how the world will operate by scientific methods. In fact, this approach guides much scientific research.
However, it's not the only thing; experimentation – which is a test used to eliminate one or two possible theories – asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on traditional texts, and particularly, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters were accepted, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge dwindled, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific origins.
Many followed a pattern in physiology and behavior that often depends on the presence of natural cycles and their generation through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely a response to recurring external cues, have been recorded in many living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will maintain an autonomous rhythm even without external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the proposals that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments to label the viral DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the viral protein with radioactive sulfur.
Changes can have different effects depending on the type of changes, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only changes in germline cells can be passed on to children, while changes elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, as well as the plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking pictures, and learning about the great apes in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns by car for work, passing others who are heading to work from the opposite direction.
In this robust means of transport, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, the transport system that relies on private vehicles.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has removed the Earth's biosphere from one of its stable states, which was supposed to sustain human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear the same level of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transportation systems take such complaints so personally, why do they fail every day? Is it that transportation engineers are incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave with some consistency; therefore, traffic congestion exhibits a certain stability and can be precisely represented statistically.
To effectively represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three main states: (1) flow, (2) density, (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of intelligent road systems.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly helped them easily evade enemies and find food and mates with ease.
Many insects are lucky enough to be able to fold their wings against their bodies.
This gives them ample opportunity for tiny hiding places from their enemy.
These days, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System orbited the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, along with the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems logical, because the Earth doesn't appear to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical quality of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the towers of their predecessors, which were at that time more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also an everyday language used by many government workers, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these can be found naturally in their native state and are easy to extract using ancient tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, put forth the idea that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new things to create what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like Calcium and Potassium are often considered metals. In fact, there are other metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that many trillions could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, that pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Sadly, as new writing methods emerge, the pencil is relegated to a lesser status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens, never needing to use a sharpener.
One might wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
This fission bomb operates on the principle that energy is required in the formation of nuclei with many protons and neutrons.
Just like rolling a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus once again and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to break apart even with the slightest touch.
The moon's surface is made up of rocks and dust. The moon's outer layer is known as the crust.
The Earth's surface is approximately 70 kilometers wide up close and 100 kilometers wide from a distance.
Under the maria it is thin but thick under the highlands.
There can be more maria on the near side because the crust is thin. It was easy for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories aim to discover what makes people continue or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become deeply rooted as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they do, and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin leading their former peers. On the one hand, they will try to associate themselves as "one of the guys" (or women).
This type of manager often finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, evaluate performance, delegate tasks, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into someone unrecognizable who feels they must change everything the team has been doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
Such behavior often leads to divisions between leaders and the entire team.
Standard teams are held to the same quality standards as other standard teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a communication hub for their physical group at the time.
They often have more freedom than regular team members because their teams might meet across different time zones, and this might be unclear to their management.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is a unique feature of virtual teams.
“Invisible team” is a management team where every member reports. The invisible team sets standards for every member.
Why should an organization go through a long process to establish a learning organization? One goal of establishing the concepts of a learning organization in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in an organization's high-performing departments, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, an organization's process of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process for serving customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Value Chain method as a means to help organizations achieve a high level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides empirical evidence for a theoretical perspective on cognitive inquiry. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it more specific.
The resemblance between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies enables us to see and examine brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
This gives us a lot of information and resources to build models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is largely associated with scientific texts, AI constitutes a very important part of the branch of computer science, addressing behavior, learning, and the adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Research in AI involves developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning, and coordinating, the ability to respond to customer recognition and questions, as well as text, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become distinct disciplines, aiming to provide solutions to life's problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as they are built into several home computer programs and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any class. Often, a teacher likes to take their students to places where a bus trip isn't an option.
Technology offers solutions through virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or enjoy exquisite art while seated in their classroom.
Participating together in a virtual farm trip is also a good way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future travelers.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the State Capital, every year that website is updated, but old versions remain online to be used as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also enhance a student's writing. As students begin their blogging experience with grammatical and spelling issues, the presence of a general audience changes that.
Since students are the most important audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to be knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's curiosity prompts students to be insightful and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration, and encourages students to broaden their reading beyond the typical school day.
Appropriate use of blogs “can enable students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can identify their positions in the context of others’ writings as well as express their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is an appealing and bilingual Canadian city, and it features an array of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present history.
Further to the south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is the heart of Muskoka's unspoiled beauty and beyond.
All these things and much more demonstrate how Ontario is naturally perceived as Canadian by outsiders.
Vast areas in the far north are sparsely populated, and some of it is uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadians.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a self-contained continent, when it comes to wildlife.
Many of the small islands are independent states, or are associated with France, and are known as beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, and it greatly affected Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that any female travelers state they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also important to wear a ring (and not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it's not an unusual thing to be followed, have one's hand grabbed, etc.
Be firm in saying no to people, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
Present-day Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but they abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least appealing places to shop in all of Morocco.
Near the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hooks, and a whole range of geegaws, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered much of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is largely safe, any trips outside the city should be investigated to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
That city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, as well as the easiest routes for tracking Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual fare for locals is 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Despite its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for very distant foreign lands.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a poor city, though its fame makes it a tourist attraction, and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
That city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, because it has a more pronounced Arabic character than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 distinct ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's attractions and is considered a major one among the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all National Parks in Southern Africa, there are daily conservation and entrance fees.
It can be beneficial for someone to buy a Park Card, which provides entry to some South African parks or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong area its name and is a major focus for many tourists.
The series of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline is matched by a pleasing bar-chart silhouette, and is likely shaped by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To get a better view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Much of Hong Kong's urban development has been concentrated on reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This is where the English colonialists considered it theirs, and so if you are looking for colonial-era evidence of the area, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forests in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland into Bangladesh and the Indian subcontinent from the coast.
The Sandarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sandarbans National Park.
Those forests are not just mangrove swamps – they include some of the last remaining great forests that were once enveloped by the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans are located in an area of 3,850 square kilometers, where one-third is covered by water/marsh.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become wildlife sanctuaries, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 deer in that area.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, although many, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it's advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Many districts are served by Japanese Coast mini-buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel in nearby areas, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, span 378 meters, and have two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant group inhabiting what is now called Eastern Paraguay, living as nomadic hunters who also cultivated subsistence crops.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally known as the "Giant of the Indi Region," was born following clashes between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest match of the year will take place in December at the polo fields in Las Kanitas.
Tournaments and minor games can also be seen from here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy polo match tickets, see the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is estimated to be equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
Overall, British pounds will be accepted anywhere in the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards may not be accepted, though British and American currency might be; check with the owners beforehand to find out what payment method is acceptable.
It's not possible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when the Northern Hemisphere is winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures of over +30ºC are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature very rarely goes below freezing point, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no specific “wet” or “dry” seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the wild are used to seeing humans, they are wild animals nonetheless and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park management, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how calm they appear, bison, elk, hartebeest, bears, and nearly all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods and maintain cleanliness at the campsite.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a famous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except one British ship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggles organized by the Mau Mau movement, a peace meeting in town led to the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the indented coastline around the two ports and Auckland. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and many of them have shade under pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale areas of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that sometimes get crowded, featuring a range of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'; it's not a complex beer, but it's good and comforting. That other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many types of French wine available, but New Zealand and Australian wine travels better.
The tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to get if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of 'white' coffee is foreign. A short black is 'espresso', cappuccino comes piled higher with cream (not foam) and tea is prepared without milk.
The hot chocolate reaches Belgian standards. The fruit syrups are expensive but they are better.
Many trips to the rock are made year-round, and injuries from any of the potential causes on the rock are rare.
Still, take advice from authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Sea caterpillars appear near the coast and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. Sometimes they may be found outside these times.
Sharks exist, although it is rare for them to attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't spend much time in the sea, as their primary habitat is river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking early gives a traveler peace of mind that they will find a place to stay upon arrival.
Travel agencies often have special hotel offers, although you can also book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies typically offer promotional packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also make a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., visas).
Any amendments or requests must be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, a large number of music festival-goers choose to camp on-site, with many considering it an essential part of the experience.
If you wanted to be close to the action, you would need to get up early to secure a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even after the music on the main stage finishes, there might be other parts of the festival that will continue playing music until midnight.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, inspect the cabin area, as sailing through ice causes an unpleasant noise for those most sensitive.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. These passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make great efforts to increase the money and time spent by gamblers. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and the exit is difficult to find.
They often have unique food, beverages, and entertainment offerings to entertain guests and keep them on their premises.
Some venues serve alcohol in-house. However, intoxication impairs decision-making, and all good gamblers know the importance of being level-headed.
Anyone driving in elevated areas or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and severe cold.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you can't drive as if you're on dry pavement.
During heavy ice, enough ice to get you stuck can fall in a short time.
Visibility can also be restricted by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snowy and icy conditions are common in many countries, and transportation continues all year round without interruption.
Perhaps safaris are the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The word 'safari' means to travel to see amazing African wild animals, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to move close to vehicles, and standard equipment will allow for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
Hiking (also known as 'bushwalking', 'trekking', or 'going on foot') involves ascents, whether for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in various locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to ever host two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flight and accommodation before the postponement was announced, you might have a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March many coronavirus cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that many event tickets will cost between 2,500 Yen and 130,000 Yen, with regular tickets costing approximately 7,000 Yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards for rent, even if one is not in that room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you could try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful the fabric doesn't get too hot (as it can cause a flash, or in the worst case, a burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some being successful against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others, several minutes will be needed.
Filters vary in performance, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a completely sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they don't recognize from their home areas.
Pests can damage food, cause annoyance, or in severe cases cause allergic reactions, spread toxins or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, usually do not qualify as pets.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods free of duty and tax in certain areas.
Travelers in high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through remote, wooded areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp turns abound.
The posted speed limits are considerably lower than those for the preceding and following sections — usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour) — and strict adherence to them is more important than elsewhere.
What's surprising, however, is that cell phone service here is much stronger than in other trail networks like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German breads are excellent, and in Bavaria, they are even better and more varied, just like those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit crumbles are common, with cooked apples used for crumbles throughout the year, and cherries and plums appearing during summer.
Most German baked goods feature almonds and nuts. Popular cakes often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small, yet superior doughnuts, try what, depending on the region, is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, including meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the mainland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in spiced gravies; in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is widely used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses a wide variety of dishes found throughout the country.
But, if used without further modifiers, that word tends to mean food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The most widely available food across large parts of the archipelago is Javanese cuisine prepared with simple artistry, its essential flavor consisting of peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports that hold the rider's feet, hanging down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider great stability, but they can be a safety concern because of the potential for the rider's feet to get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their leg gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse bolts. To reduce this risk, several safety measures can be taken.
First, many riders wear tall boots with soft, very thin soles.
Furthermore, other saddles, especially English saddles, have safety stirrups that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley – a major climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its massive granite and rock walls.
Summits offer breathtaking views from the peaks. Mountain climbers from all corners of the world continue to establish new routes among its formidable walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboards strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a major activity, with many participants, often known as "ski bums," planning their entire vacation to ski in a specific area.
The idea of snowboarding is very old - cave drawings show snowboarders from as far back as 5000 BCE!
The sport of skiing began at least in the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ice-skating club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski Backpacking: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski trekking.
It is related to but usually not associated with high-mountain skiing tours or mountaineering, the latter of which is done in steep terrain and requires a board and hard boots.
Think of a ski slope as an analogous way to climb.
In good conditions, you can cover a much greater distance than walking – but you'll very rarely achieve high gliding speeds off-road without a heavy pack on established trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean having to apply for visas and undergo passport control frequently.
The Schengen Area, however, operates largely as a single country in this regard.
You'd better stay in this area; you can cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Furthermore, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member country individually, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no general definition of what manufactured goods are considered antique. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antique.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit can be shorter in areas like North America than in Europe.
Works of art can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Arctic reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding that industry is also important for many who have other professions.
However, traditionally, not all Sami have engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and primarily kept reindeer as work animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel advisories, your health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
Perhaps you might also want to consult government advice rather than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different circumstances from Europeans and Arabs.
A briefing is just a short summary of the political situation in one country.
The comments presented are often quick, general, and greatly oversimplified compared to the in-depth information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a common term for any dangerous weather condition and has the potential to cause damage, significant social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can be anywhere in the world, and there are many types that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, drought, and wildfires are forms and effects of extreme weather, as are storms, hurricanes, waterspouts, and tornadoes.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include severe snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any adverse weather conditions affecting their area as these might affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search for ‘Hostile environment course’ online might provide the address of a local company.
Typically, the course will cover all the issues discussed here in depth, and often include hands-on experience.
Typically, the course will take 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, extensive first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines discussing life in the wild are common, but publications related to war zones are scarce.
Travelers intending to go abroad for gender reassignment surgery must ensure they carry valid documents for their return journey.
The government's readiness to issue gender-neutral (X) passports or updated documents to match the intended name and gender varies.
The readiness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies as well.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Faggots should not expect to pass a screening and emerge with their integrity and secrets intact.
Water wave currents are those that flow back after waves break on the shore, usually on a reef or similar place.
Because of the underwater topology, the returns tend to accumulate in a few deep areas, and high-speed waves in deep water can form there.
Many deaths occur due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the waves, which can be difficult.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back isn't any harder than usual.
Try to head for a place where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skill or if you've been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock comes faster than culture shock (there is a honeymoon period), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who had an easy time adapting to a new culture sometimes have a difficult time readjusting to their native culture.
When returning home after living abroad, you've become accustomed to a new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were perhaps patient and understanding, knowing travelers in a foreign country need to adapt.
People might not expect that patience and understanding are also important for travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most fun things in the children's area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in the quiet before the show begins.
Normally, you hear the voices of tourists and vendors. The sound and light story is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Events are shown on the pyramids, and different pyramids glow.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have many bases, including sixteen that were active in 2020.
The islands lie 120 kilometers north of the Cape. The largest is King George Island, which has the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a unique natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsula Mountains here join with this plain, then re-emerge to form a 360-kilometer range of the Ellsworth Mountains, and are divided by the Minnesota Glaciers.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountains, such as Vinson Massif, which reached a height of 4892 meters, and is Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without mobile phone signals, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone is not generally a substitute for a mobile phone, as you must be out in the open and have a clear line of sight to satellites to make a call.
The service is frequently used for transportation, including luxury vessels, as well as for journeys with remote data and voice requirements.
Your mobile service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular choice for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular for school leavers, allowing them to take a gap year before entering university, without affecting their studies.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap-year course abroad can certainly improve your chances of pursuing higher education in your own country.
Typically, there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great place for boating. “The Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
You don't necessarily need a ship for archipelagos and islands.
Although coastal islands and larger lakes are indeed big enough for any boat, a small boat or even a kayak offers a different experience.
Boating is an international sport in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is consistent with Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is completely different (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Many Baltic trips often include long stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for several days, returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only visit the coast by cruise ship, you won't need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin and Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a trip to this city is not included in the price of the cruises.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's not so different from the personal fear and dislike of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome fears rooted in the unknown or a lack of control.
Shipping companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Often, time is of the essence for commercial documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
In some ways, large companies have their own planes, but in other ways, small companies had problems.
If they were to send the items by air cargo, in some cases it might take several days to complete the offloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it through quickly was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations wouldn't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to travel in first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or, even better, have your company pay for it).
However, this doesn't come cheap: because of vague and oppressive laws, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual economy and business fares, and 11 times for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no need to even look for business discounts or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies know full well that there's a certain niche of travelers who are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they are adapting accordingly.
The capital city of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a nation with many ethnic groups that have suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, these conflicts led to the creation and self-proclamation of the State of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any United Nations member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very important transport hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial city, situated around a large hub and surrounded by mountains.
Wide streets, buildings with glass facades, and modern commercial centers are punctuated by traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city itself has a more European than traditional Turkish atmosphere.
The village of Haldarsvik has a view of the nearby island of Eysturoi and an unusually shaped octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are attractive marble dove sculptures on the grave.
It takes half an hour to stroll around that charming village.
To the north and in an easily accessible location, there is a romantic and charming city, made famous by visitors after recounting its dazzling splendor as recorded by Lord Byron.
The Skotabu 403 bus frequently travels to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also, to the north, visit the Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Sanctuary), a world-famous place for Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are specifically visiting a mass grave site, and also a place that holds unpredictable significance for a large portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who lived through their time here, and many others whose loved ones were killed or worked to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat that place with all the dignity, decorum, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the website by drawing on or cutting graphics in the designs.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of them prefer to speak Catalan, a large number understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, many signs are displayed in Catalan because it has been legally established as the first official language.
Spanish is still widely used in public transportation and other areas.
Regular announcements in the Metro are only made in Italian, but unplanned disruptions are announced by automatic systems using various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, arrogant, and conceited.
While this is often just a misconception, the best way to get along in Paris is still to be on your best behavior, acting like someone who is “bien e’lev’e” (well-raised). It will make getting along much easier.
The abrupt Parisian exteriors will quickly melt if you show some basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has extensive forests, particularly firs, spruces, and pine trees, and a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has diverse plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, varied soils, and differing altitudes.
The area is also home to a great variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and European quail can be found there, along with many other common species.
When visiting religious houses, women are expected to wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide kangas for women who arrive without one, but if you come with your own kanga, especially a brightly coloured one, you'll receive a smile from a monk or a nun at the entrance.
Likewise, men are required to wear trousers that cover their knees.
This can also be obtained from the stock at the gate, but those clothes are not washed after every user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing those skirts. One size fits all for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of other parts of the Mediterranean region, is made with bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and always uses olive oil.
A simple dinner, especially in summer, is often Pa amb Oli: Olive oil bread, tomatoes, and other readily available ingredients like cheese and tuna.
All nouns, including Sie for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to differentiate between some verbs and things.
Of course, it also makes reading easy, although writing is somewhat difficult due to the need to ascertain whether a verb or an adjective is used for emphasis.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because many words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
Important letters to note are c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means darling, while carro means a horse-drawn cart.
Persian has relatively simple grammar, and is often straightforward.
So, studying this grammar source will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand it better.
Needless to say, if you understand the language of love, it will be easy for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is very similar and doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern research is typically not used today, and remains as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution in their time was not a problem as it is today, they are often located in cities or at universities, easier to access than those built in modern times.
Many modern research telescopes are major instruments in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the preferred flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor for himself and other members of his inner circle at the Imperial Court.
Plants look best when in their natural environment, so avoid the temptation to remove even 'just one' specimen.
If you are visiting a formally arranged garden, collecting “specimens” will also get you removed, without discussion.
Singapore is generally a safer place to be and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
But by being situated in the 'upper tropics' just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with intense heat (constantly) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
Also, there are a few buses heading north of Hebron, the place of the traditional tombs of the biblical heroes Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you intend to board goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be beautiful holiday destinations.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or traveling in picturesque areas along the Danube or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also describe popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians worldwide.
There's a custom of staying awake on Easter night in some open place to see the sunrise.
Indeed, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may also have been a pre-Christian Spring and Fertility worship.
Most traditional churches usually hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with worshippers celebrating at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All native animals that arrived on these islands probably came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the vast distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to complete the journey, with the giant tortoise being the primary herbivore in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic and Antarctic regions during winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Aurora, as the sky will be quite dark both day and night.
Since those areas are not heavily populated, and little pollution is usually not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more structured and formal than Western practices.
Suits are common business attire, and employees call their colleagues by their family names or by their professional titles.
Balance in the workplace is important, emphasizing group efforts rather than praising individual achievements.
Occasionally, employees get approval for any decisions they make from their supervisors, and they are expected to obey their superiors' orders without question.
