USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and fully acknowledges the importance of the Olympic family promoting a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs and their sport can be better served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, rather than by mere re-approval.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can clearly explain how the extent of the abuse, courageously revealed by the Larry Nassar survivors, was able to go uninvestigated for so long, and accepts any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have similar goals: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe, positive, and encouraging an environment as possible for athletes who follow their dreams.

This confirms not only the widespread concept that dinosaurs had feathers, but also details like color and three-dimensional arrangement that fossils cannot provide.
Researchers said this animal's plumage is dark brown on top and light or orange underneath.
The discovery provides insight into feather evolution in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a developed shaft called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers say that the rachis is an older evolutionary result of these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers is not for flight, but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have stated that even though this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample is a collection of adult feathers, not those of a chicken.
Researchers said that although this is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the sample was a collection of adult feathers, not chicken feathers.

Although the work done was largely theoretical, the program was written to simulate observations from the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for is caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon has a gravitational pull on Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way has a gravitational pull on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that the effect Dark Matter has on other Dark Matter is just like that of regular matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is located in a halo around it, and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has found a severe, drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province.
In an interview, they said about the new variant, 'This is very concerning and frightening due to a very high death rate.'
Some patients may have acquired the bug in the hospital, and Dr. Moll believes that at least two of them are hospital healthcare workers.
Within one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 of their close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB among the total number of people infected with tuberculosis still appears low; in South Africa, for instance, 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected with the disease at any given moment are XDR-TB cases.

"Their thermal characteristics are not as stable as large caves on Earth that maintain a constant temperature, but this is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Group and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters would seclude themselves in a booth, and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter casts their ballot and signs the electoral roll.

Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and courts view the publication of photographs as prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University said, “If journalists publish photos and other information of suspects, it seems journalists are treading a dangerous line.”
Akil's Office, the Public Prosecutor, said it would not give any comment to journalists until there is evidence for the charge.
The document, according to the leaked information, refers to Palestine's desired border claims based on the pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
Other topics covered, as reported, include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed, while the PA, for its part, agrees to such a presence for only five years.
In further pest control trials, applicators are closely monitored by supervisors, as the trial has been controlled and its effectiveness evaluated.
Through the Sports Shooters Association's hunting program, eligible volunteers were recruited in partnership with NPWS and the Australian Sport Shooters Association (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received a comprehensive safety and training briefing.
Martelly has been sworn in to the new nine-member Transitional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the early release of the CEP as part of a package of measures to guide the country to the new election.
The commission was Martelli's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that started in October.
Occasionally violent protests, some of which have been ongoing since 2011, are caused by the failure to hold elections.
Approximately 60 iPod overheating malfunction incidents have been reported, with a total of six fires occurring and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) acknowledged 27 accidents related to its equipment.
Last week, METI stated that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents that it called "non-serious".
The Minister responded by calling Apple's report transfer "truly regrettable."
The earthquake hit Marina at 07:19 AM local time (Friday 09:19 PM GMT).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said there are no reported damages reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, after hijacking a bus.
Rolando Mendoza shot his M16 rifle at tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as Filipino photographers, were released earlier.
Because she wanted to go to the toilet, the photographers took the old woman's place. Mendoza was killed by a gun.
Ligins, following in his father's footsteps, joined the medical profession.
They trained as a gynecologist and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began to study premature labor in his spare time.
His study shows that administering a hormone accelerates the baby's fetal lung maturity.
Government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
Her comrades also expressed their condolences to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on a two-moon night. Just like her, uniquely beautiful. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was very crazy like me… maybe more than me… I love her and I miss her… We hope she is in a better place."
Among 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last Queen.
At opposite ends of the poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming was scheduled to compete in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was in doubt due to niggling injuries.
Because he was banned from the games, he was unable to take the medication he needed to cope with his pain.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has found the largest prime number as of January 25.
The finding was confirmed by many people using various hardware and software by early February and was made public on Tuesday.
Comets might be a source of Earth's water supply, bringing organic substances that can form proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed.
The 53-year-old Kumo started his rule earlier this year, and a law to legalize same-sex marriage was signed last month.
He called the allegations "political turmoil and foolishness."
They are expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims allows an airplane to save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions annually by making shorter trips.
Unlike the previous ground-radar-based technology, air traffic controllers use satellite-based technology to identify aircraft with greater accuracy and to provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional services are being added, and Overground trains will not stop at Wembley; and car parking is not available at our park and ride facilities.
Fears of transportation shortages increased the likelihood that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the evolution of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species was formed in just two generations due to interbreeding between the rare Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortis) and the common cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris), despite estimations that this process would take a longer time.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can bend and coil. It can be flattened smooth or rolled up.
It is made very thin and attached to another metal. Its extreme thinness meant it was used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts".
This is called a chemical's pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage liquid.
Cabbage juice changes color based on the chemical's acidity or basicity (alkalinity).
The pH level in the chemical tested is indicated by the concentration of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been removed (hence, hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron).
Sift the two dry powders together, then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands interacts with the outer layers, which creates a peculiar sensation and forms a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had flush toilets in every house, which were connected to an advanced drainage system.
Remains of the sewage system were found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes an integral part of public baths where men and women would mix together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and instantly reflects it back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Since Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and images, researchers use telescopes in space.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a massive rocket over 100 feet tall is required.
The wheel has remarkably changed the world. The greatest thing the wheel did for us is that it provided very simple and fast transportation.
He has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Under them, there are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat a vast number of small animals such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a distinct method that prevents each cat from competing with the others.
Lions are very social cats that live in large groups called prides.
Lion prides consist of one to three young males, up to thirty females, and cubs.
The females are often very closely related to each other; many are families of sisters and daughters.
Lion distemper, like in wolves or dogs, is very dangerous to animals like lions (but not other big cats) and their prey.
The tiger is a well-rounded athlete, able to climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four cats can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's full-throated roar, but more like a series of grunts and growls.
Ocelots/desert cats like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds. Almost all the animals that Ocelots/desert cats hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists locate Ocelots (wild cats) by following the prey animals they find by scenting their previous locations on the ground.
They have excellent night vision and can move around well. Ocelots find prey by blending in with their surroundings.
Small populations of living things (with low population sizes), when they separate from their main population (for example, by moving past a mountainous area, crossing a river, or traveling to a new island from which they cannot easily return), often find themselves in an environment different from their original one.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new species requires different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than previously required.
The original species has never changed; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, their resemblance to other populations diminishes.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two peoples will have diverged so much in appearance that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the creation of new species. The creation of new species is an inevitable outcome and an essential part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe, and take in the carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is, what is breathed out).
Plants prepare their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants, and we also make clothes from plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its era, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were armed with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and it had an additional set on the roof of its mouth, which meant there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for certain, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been cannibalistic.
It would attack anything that entered the water, and even a giant dinosaur like a T. Rex could not be its equal.
While we are familiar with most of their cuisine, the Romans also had exotic or unusual dishes for their banquets, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and dormice.
Another difference is that while the poor and women eat their food sitting on chairs, the rich like to hold a large feast where they can socialize together on the side as they eat their own meal.
Ancient Roman foods could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or even cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered a house of the gods.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to attend to the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the wall was a special sanctuary for his God.
In the Middle East's hot climate, the house was not very necessary.
Most Hebrew family life was lived outdoors.
Women cook in the backyard; shops had open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever his discovery, Eskimo tribes were living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Despite what is written on the back of the document, this is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence Dated July 4, 1776." The text is visible upside down at the bottom of the document.
Though its author remains unknown, early in its existence, the great parchment manuscript (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, the note may have been added only as an identifier.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated Northern France, but the south was still not liberated.
It was administered by "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated Southern France and were returning to Germany.
Civilization is a unified culture shared by a society, made up of large populations living and working cooperatively.
The word 'civilization' comes from 'civilis', meaning 'civil', and is connected to the Latin 'civis', meaning 'citizen', and 'civitas', meaning 'city' or 'municipal government', which in some way describes the scope of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. The culture of civilization refers to the transfer of knowledge across many generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable distribution.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving valuable historical evidence and are not recognized as a regular civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially established a weak central government—with Congress as its sole body—under the Articles of Confederation.
The council did not have the power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or court, it often relied on uncooperative state leaders to enforce all its laws.
Additionally, it did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
Before the articles were approved, they required unanimous consent from all regions, and because the regions did not properly engage with the central government, their representatives were mostly absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the German national team, and they were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Italians are competing in international games and the Olympics, and winter sports are very popular in the northern regions.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the world's 7th largest island nation!
Because of its collection of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical terms.
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century, when European mariners passing by named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its foundation in southern Taiwan by inspiring changes in the grain production practices of the natives and by hiring Chinese day laborers to work in its sugar and rice factories.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885, they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, surrendering sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which controlled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures known as Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings within the compound have been rebuilt to give tourists a better understanding of how they originally arrived.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the reconstruction work continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic image format in the world is still 35mm, which was the primary film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but its aspect ratio has been superseded by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format was actually somewhat confusing, being 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) have an aspect ratio that is equal to or very close to this.
The much-maligned and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline to create flexibility while maintaining a certain standard in the image.
It says the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into three (see example).
During this period in European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under investigation.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united the states of Europe despite linguistic and cultural differences.
The all-destructive power affects everyone, from the elite to the commoner.
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's financial fund is specifically allocated for this reason.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this accumulation of power and wealth has led many to question whether its fundamental guiding principles are being compromised.
Soon after the fighting began, Britain began to blockade the German navy.
Although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries, the strategy has proven effective by cutting off essential military and civilian supplies.
The British mined international waters to prevent any ship from passing through vast expanses of water, which posed a danger even to neutral vessels.
Since there was only a limited response to the tactic, Germany had anticipated a similar outcome for the unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prominent characteristic of many citizens and countries was anti-war and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, countries wanted to prevent such a situation from recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He entered the US with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of thanks from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China has a unique way of marking different time periods; every Chinese era or every ruling family had a clearly distinct dynasty.
And thus, it was an unstable era of territories divided among various dynasties. The most notable of these times was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, a fierce war was fought among many princes who were struggling for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a bloody period in ancient Chinese history, where thousands of people fought and died while struggling to sit on the highest seat in Xi'an Palace.
There are many social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from genuineness to populism, nationalism, and the notion that the country belongs to its people and not to a single ruler.
Additionally, after the revolution, highly sought-after professions that enabled success were open to all male applicants.
The same applies to the military personnel, because their army ranking was now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution inspired working-class people in many other oppressed countries to start their own rebellions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this ordinary life. To meditate, he would often go to the cave known as Hira on Mount Nur (Light).
The cave itself, which has survived from that era, provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Its location atop one of the mountains north of Mecca has completely isolated the cave from the rest of the world.
In reality, even if one knows it exists, it's never easy to find. Once inside the cave, it's total isolation.
Nothing is visible except for the clear, beautiful sky around the many mountains. From inside the cave, only a very small part of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, located in Egypt's 'Valley of the Dead', contains many pyramids (including the Great Pyramid, which is the largest), numerous smaller tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and families.
The "upper fold" symbol looks like V and the "lower fold" symbol looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom part.
Up means you must push the bow starting at the tip, while down means you must start from the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upstroke usually produces a soft sound, while the downstroke is stronger and more assertive.
You can mark your own score with a pencil, but the printed bowing marks are there for musical reasons, so they must be respected.
The very frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by an angry mob of market women.
They returned to Paris surrounded by a large number of people shouting and making threats against the King and Queen.
People gathered for a riot forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows widely.
At one point, a mob member was waving the head of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified Queen.
United States Imperialism paid the cost of the war to the Filipino people.
On behalf of the Philippine government, they agreed to pay unspecified expenses and bond interest to US investors through Wall Street banks.
Indeed, the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people, among the most profitable established, yields fundamental benefits for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the circumstances that prompted the creation of the religious group.
The period when the events occurred is known as the High Middle Ages in European history, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages are preceded by the Early Middle Ages and are followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a strong conviction that, in practice, encompasses numerous ideas and tends towards the belief that human destiny emerges from a fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and the manifestation of technology, driven by technological impulse or necessity.
Most definitions of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the motor car inevitably leads to road development.
However, a nationwide road network for small cars is not economically viable, so new production methods have been established to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Owning many vehicles also leads to a higher probability of accidents on the road, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques for repairing damaged parts.
Romanticism was a major part of the cultural commitment that originated from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, geography-related cultures and rules that organically suited a society's place were superior to arbitrary creations.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a major luxury center lasted from 400 A.D. to 1100 A.D.
In the twelfth century, the situation declined primarily because Christian crusaders returned with valuable gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine market supplied.
It was at this time that the title of "fashion capital" was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic architecture was at its height between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, the dress had a significant influence on Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication methods, lifestyles in the West can be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own dress style. Due to the wars, one of the biggest developments of the time was that people started using buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture means when a farmer has produce that can only benefit himself and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system which uses heirloom seeds native to the ecosystem, and combines with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal norms, enabling them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary depending on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that make a subculture unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a unique and symbolic style that includes fashion, practices, and argot.
One of the most common ways we explain the importance of social life is by looking at children who grew up in adverse conditions, abuse, or suffering, and who did not learn to co-exist with their caregivers.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (often their own parents); in some cases, this child's abandonment is because their parents did not accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Children who are abandoned or run away may have experienced severe child abuse or emotional trauma before their abandonment or before running away.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals, some are said to have lived alone in the forest.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child completely displays behaviors characteristic of wild animals (for example, fear or indifference towards human beings).
While project-based learning aims to make learning easy and engaging, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support for individuals starting a new learning process, such as those using a new computer program or beginning a new project.
Summaries can be both virtual and real. In other words, the instructive little man who attaches documents in Microsoft Office is a way of summarizing.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded within the software and are designed for the student to inquire about and explore procedures that might be challenging to grasp independently, and to explain their processes.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even theft.
No child should grow up in an environment lacking care, concern, and instruction, but they inevitably do.
We consider the foster care system a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the essential needs that were lacking in the home they were previously removed from.
The Internet combines the characteristics of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions regarding the uses and gratification approach.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' have been identified as key motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Furthermore, "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) while examining audience responses to websites.
Video recording has led to significant discoveries in interpreting subtle expressions and facial movements lasting just a few milliseconds.
It is particularly believed that by accurately interpreting micro-expressions, one can verify whether a person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay 'The President's Speech', described how people with brain damage, who were unable to understand speech, were able to accurately assess sincerity.
He mentioned that such abilities to identify human characteristics can also be shared by animals like domesticated dogs.
The study conducted in the 20th century shows that genetic variation has two pools: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes from the available pool of variation.
A contentious difference of separation and reunification with each generation between the two pools.
In savannas, it is difficult for hominids with human-like digestive systems to meet their amino acid requirements from the plant food sources available there.
Additionally, failure to do this has severe consequences: depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources could have been proteins found in leaves and pulses, but these are difficult for mammals like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to chew and provide high amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved 'their protein problem' to some extent, just as chimps on the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of consciously waking up during your regular sleep time and falling back asleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to awareness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself readjusting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the opposite side of the room to make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking a lot of fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces one to wake up to urinate.
A person's inner peace is inversely related to the level of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force becomes. Every person has the capacity to achieve perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can acquire knowledge. The only thing standing in the way is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but is extended by the Mahayana path of compassion and with many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and an all-encompassing journey of love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the power of awareness) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan Meditation Center is Divine Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and an enlightened consciousness is created.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, fostering cooperation between the USSR and the United States. When the war ended, systemic, procedural, and cultural conflicts led nations to decline.
Two years before the war ended, the Cold War began because former allies were now enemies.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and the actual fighting took place on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses were broken and the only hope was to retreat and regroup with Romanian forces.
However, these plans failed overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded Poland's eastern regions, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, and subsequently established Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships for the movement of goods, and for transporting numerous people and cargo across oceans, is by far the most effective method available to date.
The traditional role of naval forces is to ensure your country's ability to move people and goods, and at the same time, to disrupt your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
A notable recent example is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were attempting to move personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to assist Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, primarily using U-boats.
Even if the Allied Powers had fallen, Germany, just as it had occupied the entire rest of Europe, could perhaps have taken Britain.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to expect milk, wool, meat, and hides to be easily provided to them.
Domestic goats have usually been kept in wandering herds in mountains or other grazing areas, often looked after by known shepherds, whether children or adults. These herding methods are still in use today.
In the early 16th century, Wagenweighs was built in England.
Although the wagons only consisted of parallel planks, they enabled horses to achieve greater speed and pull heavier loads than was possible on the somewhat difficult roads of the day.
Cross-ties were introduced from early on to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that tracks would be more effective if they were made of metal.
This became a common practice, but iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, with people beginning to walk approximately two million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning 'upright man').
Early Australopithecus did not walk upright as was customary.
Although bipedal advancements were found in Australopithecus fossils 4.2-3.9 million years ago, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become advocates to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many ways, this is like symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't just want temporary solutions, then we must find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is clearly known that the world has changed significantly due to scientific and technological advancements, and problems have been increasing due to population growth and humanity's excessive lifestyle.
On July 4th, after it was adopted by Congress, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was taken to a printing house a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies of what are now called "Dunlop Broadsides" were produced throughout the night.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
The first was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. The copy reached London on August 10.
To date, the 25 known Dunlap broadsides are early surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds; they look like dinosaurs.
They have legs equipped with teeth and claws, they lay eggs, and like T-Rex, they walk on their two hind legs.
Currently, almost all computers are based on data transmission encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number has only two possible values; namely 0 or 1. These numbers are known as binary numbers - or bits, to use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that they cannot be quickly diagnosed.
The best sign of internal poisoning could be the presence of open medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the text if there are specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The word "bug" is the conventional term used by entomologists for a group of insects.
This word comes from an ancient species of bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to living near humans.
Both biting gnats and bed bugs are parasitic, adapted to live in their dwellings or within a parasitic habitat.
Throughout the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which makes it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has confirmed that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
Couples can decide that raising a child is not their desire or not in the child's best interest.
This couple may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, parents terminate their parental rights to allow another couple to raise the children.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method truly guides scientific research.
But it is not alone; experimentation, where an experiment is a test useful for eliminating one or more hypotheses; asking questions; and also conducting observations guide scientific study.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's view is accepted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, Westerners found themselves separated from their Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often primarily determined by the existence of natural cycles and the function of biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not easily responsive to external periodic signals have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain free-running cycles even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence for the idea that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
By labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur, they conducted two experiments.
Mutation can have various distinct effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other cells cause the cell to die or lead to cancer.
Nature-based tourism allows people interested in visiting natural environments to enjoy plants and animals, including wildlife.
Examples of activities carried out on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is learning about, visiting, and taking photographs of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people commute by car from small rural towns to their workplaces, and they are passed by others whose work destinations are the towns they just left.
In this dynamic transportation landscape, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a private-car-based transport system.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has disrupted the biosphere from the stable state that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, sometimes complaints about water quality and bridge collapses are heard equally.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Does that mean transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental at play?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement and interactions of drivers and vehicles between two points.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within a reasonably consistent range; consequently, traffic flows will have a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help to plan, design, and carry out operations for road utilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them easily escape enemies and efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings by retracting their bodies.
This provides them with a wide range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are dragonflies and Mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Although some people thought correctly, many people, on the contrary, believed that the solar system, including the sun and other stars, revolved around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, because the earth doesn't seem to move, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river.
Additionally, the Amazon is by far the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small tributary rivers.
Even though stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza Pyramids were never surpassed in their size and technical scale of construction.
The New Kingdom Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the world's smallest sovereign country and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its statutes and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because all of these can be found in nature and are easy to mine with ancient tools.
The philosopher Aristotle postulated that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
While this is just like the four states of matter (in the same order) - solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, he proposed that they transform into new elements to create what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Indeed, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys can also include non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
So, when it came out, it was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing styles emerged, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and fewer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever needing to approach a typing device.
When something new comes, one can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle of concentrating all possible energy from protons and neutrons into the nucleus.
Like a heavy cart rolling down a hill. By splitting the nucleus again, a certain amount of energy is then released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to spontaneously decay with little or no contact.
The moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The edge is 70 km thick on the near side, and 100 km on the far side.
It is thin under the shade, and plump under the highland.
There can be many maria nearby because the crust is thin. It was easy for the lava to rise.
Current concepts are focused on finding what attracts people.
These concepts indicate that as people grow into adulthood, they have certain desires and/or aspirations designed within them.
These concepts indicate what makes certain people want to do the things they do, and what causes things around them to do or not do certain things.
Two prominent content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when administrators start leading their former peers. One is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of supervisor has the unenviable task of making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end, it devolves into an unknown individual who believes that everything the group was doing should be changed and made their own.
Regardless, the leader will ultimately be responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often causes disputes between leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups are held to the same high standards as conventional groups, but they have subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team serve as a point of contact for their closest physical team.
Often more self-managing than typical team members, they connect across various time zones in ways their local managers may not understand.
The existence of a true "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, P109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The 'Invisible Group' is a management team where each of its members reports. The Invisible Group sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? It is an innovative goal to put the concepts of organizational learning into practice.
If all available resources are effectively utilized within the organization's departments, creativity and ingenuity will be evident.
For this reason, an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new creative process to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous method through which the institutional approach was utilized to help organizations achieve high performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to investigating perception. Therefore, it narrows the scope of the research and makes it more accurate.
The relationship between the study of mental illness and behavior helps researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, emotional trauma, injuries, and internal swellings affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to observe and examine brain structures and processes in an unprecedented way.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand processes within our minds.
Despite AI's strong presence in science fiction, it is a very important part of computer science that studies how to instill behavior, learning, and intelligence in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer inquiries and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become distinct systems, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now predominantly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military; they have also been integrated into many home computers and video game applications.
Field trips are an integral part of any class. Often, the teacher prefers to take her students to places inaccessible by bus.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit water bodies, or appreciate beautiful art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on the trip and share experiences for future lessons.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their annual trip to the state capital, and each year the website is revised, but older versions remain online as they serve as a reference.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and writing, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Because students are often very critical audiences, the blog writer begins to strive to improve their posts to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging 'forces students to have more knowledge about the world around them.' The need to cater to the audience's interests motivates students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that fosters cooperation and encourages students to enhance their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs strengthens students to become analysts and strong critics; by diligently responding to online educational materials, students can express their position in relation to other texts and articulate their own views on specific issues (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, home to numerous art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, while to the north lie Muskoka and, beyond that, untouched natural beauty.
All these things and more reliably position Ontario as what outsiders perceive as Canadian.
In the north, large expanses are few and far between, and some are uninhabitable deserts.
In a population comparison that surprises many, African Americans living in the United States outnumber Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
In terms of wildlife, Madagascar is the largest to date and a continent in itself.
Most small islands are independent countries or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, and it is very widespread in Comoros and Mayotte.
Because the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India, European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all women travelers state they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also useful (though not one that looks too expensive).
Women should consider that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as harassment, and that following and pulling by the hand, etc., is not uncommon.
Be firm in saying no to men and don't be afraid to hold your ground (regardless of cultural differences, it doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca, founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, served as a strategic port called Anfa for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Blanca, but after an earthquake in 1755, they abandoned it again.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city, naming it Daru El Badia, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find traditional Moroccan goods such as pottery plates, ceramics, leather products, shisha pipes, and general trinkets for sale, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located at the eastern tip of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano eruption destroyed and buried most of the streets of Goma, especially its city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside of the city require careful assessment to understand the ongoing combat situation in North Kivu province.
In addition to being one of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa, the city also serves as a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) fare for a short journey is around 500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a byword for exotic and faraway lands.
Even today, Timbuktu, although its fame has made it a tourist attraction and it has an airport, is a poor city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s PBS "Wonders of the African World".
Due to its more Arab than African character, the city is a complete contrast to the other cities in the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 sq. km; it is divided into 14 different eco-zones; each containing different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa’s main attractions, and it is considered a major symbol of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
One might find it beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to parks throughout South Africa, including all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gave its name to the Hong Kong territory, is a place many tourists consider a main attraction.
The rows of skyscrapers forming Hong Kong's skyline have been compared to a sparkling bar chart, reflected in Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront across from it.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is built on reclaimed land along its northern shore.
This is a place the English colonizers took as their own, and so if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial era, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) across the territories of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest within the Indian state is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not only mangrove swamps - they include the last remnants of the dense forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², one-third of which is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife habitat, and it is currently estimated that 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer live in the area.
Buses depart throughout the day from the district bus stations (across the river), although most of them, especially those traveling to the East and Jakkar/Bumthan, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to purchase tickets a few days in advance, as inter-district buses are often full.
Most districts are served by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese Coaster buses.
Shared taxis like Paro (Nu 150) and Panuka (Nu 200) are fast and convenient ways to travel to nearby places.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the entire Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, with a 378-meter-long road that has two 3.50-meter-wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not open to the public until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs inspection is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were a very important indigenous group of the country, living as semi-nomadic hunters and practicing subsistence agriculture in what is now eastern Paraguay.
Other indigenous tribes in the Chaco region, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as "The Vast Territory of the Indians," came into being as a result of the Spanish conquerors' clashes with indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the colonial era that lasted for three hundred years.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve many indigenous characteristics and identities.
Argentina is very well known for having one of the very best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year will take place in December at the Las Canitas polo fields.
Here, small competitions and games can also be seen at other times of the year.
Check Association Argentina de Polo for news on competitions, polo games, and where to buy tickets.
The Falkland Pound (FKP) is the official currency of the Falkland Islands, which is set equal to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, in Stanley, beyond the FIC West store.
British Pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US Dollars are also usually accepted.
Although British and US currency may be accepted, credit cards may not be accepted in the outer islands; please confirm accepted payment methods with the owners in advance.
It is impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands; so, exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice-versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; in summer, temperatures of +30°C are common.
The winter can be deceptively cold; the temperature sometimes drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons; the amount of rainfall remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, and they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other animals.
No matter how docile they may seem, buffalo, wild boars, deer, bears, and all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year for failing to maintain an appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous; so, give them space.
Furthermore, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals; therefore, avoid handling or preparing odorous foods and clean your campsite.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port became the scene of a little-known naval confrontation after seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain refused to leave.
All ships sank, except for one British warship. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
A peaceful gathering in the city during the freedom struggle organized by the Mau movement resulted in the killing of the great chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland's two ports, there are many beaches. The most famous ones are located in three places.
The Northern Shores (in the North Harbour District) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All are, one could say, sandy beaches suitable for swimming, many of which offer shade provided by Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive's seaside attractions are on Waitemata Harbour, within the expensive Central Auckland suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded, and surrounded by various types of shops. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'; it is not a complex beer, but enjoyable and satisfying. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to choose from, but New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're concerned, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of 'flat white' coffee is quite distinct. A short black is an espresso, cappuccino is topped with cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but very good.
Underwater trips are conducted throughout the year, and incidents caused by these sea-related factors are rare.
Still, take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to security warnings.
Box jellyfish occur north of 1770 from October to April, near coastal recreational areas and river estuaries. Outside these times, they can be found occasionally.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not naturally live in the ocean; their main habitat is the Fitzroy River, located north of Rockhampton.
Pre-registration provides travelers with peace of mind because they know they have a place to stay upon arrival.
While you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent, travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or combined flight and hotel packages.
Also, if you need time to consider the offer or to get other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa), they can hold the place for you.
However, any changes or inquiries should be handled through the travel agent, not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival participants choose to stay on site, and many attendees consider this an important part of the experience.
You'll need to arrive early to get a spot close to the music if you want to be close to the action.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages ends, there might be sections of the event playing music until late into the night.
Some festivals have a separate camping area for families with small children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic in winter, check the compartment layout because moving through ice causes a very horrible and severely damaging sound.
Saint Petersburg cruise tours include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check terms and conditions).
Casinos traditionally go to great lengths to maximize the time and money guests spend. Windows and clocks are often absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They mostly have special food, drinks, and entertainment offerings for guests to stay in good spirits and to stay at the reception.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages for free. However, getting drunk impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the advantage of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or on mountain passes should consider that snow, ice, or freezing temperatures may be present.
On snowy and icy roads, traction is low, so you cannot drive as you would on bare asphalt.
During periods of extreme cold and ice, snow that can immobilize you can fall very quickly.
Visibility can be restricted by falling or blowing snow, water spray, or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries, snowy and icy conditions are common, and traffic mostly continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are arguably the biggest draw for tourism in Africa and a major highlight for many visitors.
The word "safari" traditionally refers to traveling by land to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals like elephants and giraffes tend to approach cars, so standard equipment provides good views.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
Hiking (also known as "bushwalking," "mountain trekking," or "walking") involves ascending mountains for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other areas throughout Japan.
Because it hosted the games in 1964, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodation before the extension was announced, you could be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies will not last until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
While typical tickets cost around ¥7,000, most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available to borrow, even if they aren't in the room.
If you don't have an iron or don't like creased socks, you can use a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (it can cause wrinkling or, in some severe cases, burning).
There are various ways to purify water, some are effective for specific dangers.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they are unfamiliar with in their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread poisons, or transmit diseases.
Dangerous animals that can harm or kill people, either directly or by force (such as through infectious diseases), are often not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase certain tax-free goods in specific areas.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway between Point Marion and Fairmont, frequently traversing rugged terrain, offers very difficult driving conditions.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be cautious: steep sections, narrow roads, and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits in the preceding and succeeding sections—typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—are noticeably lower, and strict adherence to them is far more beneficial than non-compliance.
Surprisingly, however, mobile service is stronger here than in other areas where the lines are laid, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweet cakes are very good, and in Bavaria, like their southern neighbor, Austria, they are rich and diverse.
Throughout the year, as apples ripen for baking and strawberries and berries appear in the summer, fruit bakes are common.
Many German baked goods include almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes mostly pair exceptionally well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small sweet cakes, try to find out what they are called depending on the region: Berliner Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, with meat or vegetables.
Food cooked with spices can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland areas of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is traditionally used in curries, while in South India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is mostly used.
Encompassing 17,000 diverse islands, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that covers a wide variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, when used without any other qualifiers, the word refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely found in the archipelago, Javanese cooking methods involve lightly seasoned dishes, and the main seasonings loved by Javanese people include peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's legs that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the driver, but they can pose safety risks as the driver's foot can get stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but one foot remains caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged when the horse runs. Many safety precautions must be taken to reduce the risk.
Initially, many riders wear their riding boots that have heels and soft, narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety stirrup bars that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle when a falling rider pulls backwards.
Cochamo Valley, dubbed the 'killer of South America' and Chile's primary climbing destination, boasts numerous diverse large granite walls and crags.
High places offer stunning views. Hang gliders from all over the world are creating new routes along the endless wall.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding downhill on snow-covered ground with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourism activity with many enthusiasts, known as “snow lovers,” who plan entire holiday seasons around skiing in one location.
The idea of skiing is very old - drawings believed to depict skiers on caves date back to 5000 BC!
As a sport, downhill skiing dates back at least to the 17th century, and the first recreational skiing club was opened in Australia by Norwegians in 1861.
Traveling with a ski pack: This activity is called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
Although often associated with Alpine-style ski touring or mountain hiking, it does not include these. The latter are performed in narrow terrain and require very sturdy long wooden or plastic skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a similar mountain ascent route.
In good conditions, you might cover a somewhat greater distance than walking – but on a groomed trail, without a heavy pack, you can rarely, but sometimes, achieve cross-country ski speed.
Europe, by contrast, though a small continent, has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling between different countries means you have to spend a lot of time on visa applications and passport control.
The Schengen Zone, however, functions like a single country in this regard.
Within this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control and checkpoints.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa separately for Schengen member states, so you save time, money, and paperwork.
There is no international definition for what constitutes manufactured heritage. Some tax organizations define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
This means that in places like North America, where the lifespan is shorter than in Europe, there are geographical differences.
Handicraft products, although they may be more recent than similar mass-produced items, can be described as ancient.
