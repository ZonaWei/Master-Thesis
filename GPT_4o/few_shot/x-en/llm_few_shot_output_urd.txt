Although an experimental vaccine appears to reduce the mortality rate from Ebola, no drug has yet been found to be clearly suitable for treating the current infection.
An antibody cocktail, Zymep, initially sparked hope in this field, but formal research found it wasn't as beneficial as needed to prevent death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as the control, meaning the scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
American Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute necessity for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and their clubs can be better served by bringing meaningful changes to our organization rather than nullifying the certification.
The American gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how the abuse of proportions, as fully described by the survivors of Larry Nassar, remained undetected for so long and to accept some necessary and appropriate change.
American Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes, so they can realize their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but it also provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage (feathers) was chestnut brown with yellow on top or carotenoid-colored underneath.
This research also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feather does not have a well-developed shaft, known as the rachis, but it does have other feather characteristics - the barbs and the tip - researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later with the development of other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows mature feathers and does not display the fine inner feathers of a chick.
Researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not the fine feathers of a chick.

They found the sun, like other stars, to be based on the same fundamental principles: the activity of all the stars in the system was found to be influenced by nothing else but their light and rotation.
The star's Rossby number is determined by using its brightness and rotation together, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the stars will be in terms of reverse magnetism.
During his visit, Iwasaki faced difficulties several times.

The 802.11n standard operates on both 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz frequencies.
It will provide backward compatibility with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g, provided that the base station has a dual radio.
802.11n speed is reasonably faster than its predecessor, with a theoretical throughput of 600Mbit/s.
The father of two grown children, the married dual did not impress Miller much, about whom the story was.
When asked for his opinion, Miller said, "Mike talks a lot during the hearing... I was getting ready, so I really couldn't hear what he was saying."
He said, "We will strive to cut carbon dioxide per unit of GDP by a notable level from 2005 levels by 2020."

Encourage developing countries by saying, "Avoid the trend of 'pollute first and clean up later.'"
