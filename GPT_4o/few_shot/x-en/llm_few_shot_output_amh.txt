This not only supports the widespread theory that dinosaurs had feathers, but also confirms details like color and three-dimensional arrangement that fossils cannot provide.
Researchers have said that the fur of this animal is dark brown on top and white or orange underneath.
The discovery provides insight into the evolutionary change in birds.
Since there is no fossil record of a dinosaur with feathers called rachis, but because other feather structures — barbs and barbules — exist, researchers suggest that rachis is an evolutionary outcome retained from these other structures.
The arrangement of the feathers is not for flight but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have stated that while this may be a juvenile dinosaur's crest, it is a collection of intelligent feathers rather than resembling a chicken.
Researchers have stated that although this is a child's dinosaur toy, the model is a collection of intelligent mammals rather than a chicken.

The fundamental process by which the sun operates has been found to be similar to that of other stars; it has been discovered that the movement of all stars within the system is governed by fusion, their rotation, and nothing else.

If the Rossby number is low, the star's activity decreases compared to magnetic braking.
