The United States Olympic Committee letter supports and fully recognizes the necessity of ensuring a safe environment for all our athletes within the Olympic family.

This not only supports the widespread theory that dinosaurs had feathers, but also confirms details such as color and three-dimensional arrangement that fossils cannot provide.
Researchers have said that this animal has a dark brown upper coat and a white or orange-brown undercoat.
The finding provides insight into the evolutionary change in birds.
Because there is no fossil record of a dinosaur called Rachis, researchers suggest that Rachis is a result of evolutionary changes from other feathered creatures, such as Barbies and Barbules.
The arrangement of the feathers is not for flight but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have stated that while this may be a juvenile dinosaur's crest, the specimen is a collection of intelligent feathers rather than a chicken.
Researchers have stated that while this may be a juvenile dinosaur tail, the specimen is more likely a collection of intelligent lizards rather than a bird.

The basic principle by which the sun operates has been found to be similar to that by which other stars operate; it has been discovered that the movement of all stars in the system is governed by fusion, their rotation, and nothing else.
They used it to search for the stellar Rossby number, which is associated with the level of brightness and its modulation with plasma flow.
If the Rossby number is low, the star's activity decreases in relation to magnetic braking.
