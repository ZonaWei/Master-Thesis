English: "Now we have 4-month-old mice that are not diabetic but were diabetic," he added.
Dr. Ehud Ur, a professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and chair of the medical and scientific department of the Canadian Diabetes Association, warned that the research is just beginning.

On Monday, Sara Danius, the permanent secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature at the Swedish Academy, publicly announced during a radio program on Sveriges Radio in Sweden that the committee, as it is unable to directly reach Bob Dylan regarding his winning of the Nobel Prize in Literature, has ceased efforts to contact him.
Danius said, "For now, we are doing nothing. I have called and also sent emails to those closest to him and his collaborators and received friendly responses. For now, that is certainly enough."
Previously, the chief executive of Ring, Jamie Siminoff, said the company started when it was unclear if someone was knocking at the door while he was in his store in his garage.
He built a WiFi doorbell, he said.

At the end of 2017, Siminoff appeared on the television shopping program QVC.
English: Ring resolved a case with its competitor in the security industry, ADT Corporation.
Although the experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce deaths caused by Ebola, so far, no medication has been clearly shown to be suitable for treating the existing disease.
English: Just one cocktail in the body, ZMapp, initially seemed promising in the field, but research shows that it has a smaller impact than previously thought in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp acted as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline for comparison and compared three other treatments against it.
English: Strengthening Muscle and Bone Exercise in America supports the book of the American Olympic Committee and acknowledges the comprehensive need for the Olympic family to ensure a safe environment for all our athletes.
English: We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of the athletes and teams, as well as their games, can be better served by moving forward with a change within our organization, rather than by taking certificates.
English: USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse of the magnitude described so bravely by those who survived Larry Nassar could have gone unnoticed for so long and welcomes any necessary and appropriate changes.
American gymnastics and the USOC have a similar goal — to make gymnastics, and other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.
Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor and then for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
During the 1976 election, he advised Carter on foreign policy, and then served as the National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, succeeding Henry Kissinger.
English: Like the NSA, assist Khatha in handling national affairs wisely, like the Camp David Accords in 1978; establishing normal relations between America and China in the late 1970s; the Iranian revolution, which led to the Iran hostage crisis in 1979; and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

The announcement was made after Trump called the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

English: This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils do not usually offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
English: Scientists say the plumage of this animal had a brown chest on top, pale and colorful on the sides.
The research provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, known as the rachis, but have other feather features — barbs and barbules — researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation and display. Researchers suggest that, although this is a tail of a small dinosaur, the sample reveals ancient feathers and not the fuzz of a juvenile.
Researchers suggest that, even if this is a dinosaur tail, the sample reveals ancient feathers and not a juvenile's fluff.
A car bomb that exploded at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twelve other people.

They discovered that the sun operates on basic principles like other stars: the work of all stars in the system was found to be guided by their light, their rotation, and nothing else.
English: Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
If the Rossby number is small, the star does not have significant gravitational pull.
During this journey, Iwasaki frequently encountered problems.
He was held up by pirates at sea, attacked by a rabid dog in Tibet, fled a wedding in Nepal, and was arrested in India.
English: The 802.11n standard operates in both the 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequency bands.
This will allow it to be compatible with the older 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g standards, as long as the access point has two radios.
The speed of 802.11n is much higher than the previous one which was maintained at a speed of 600Mbit/s.
Duvall, who is married with two older children, did not impress Miller, the one who was told the story.

"We will succeed in reducing the amount of air pollution per unit of GDP by a significant margin by 2020 from the 2005 level," said Hu.
He did not specify the number of divisions, saying they would be made based on the outcome of China's economy.
UHu encouraged developing countries "to avoid the old path of polluting first and cleaning up later."
English: He added that "they must not, however, be asked to take on responsibilities beyond their stage of development, capabilities, and skills."
