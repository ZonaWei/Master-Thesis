Match: NO
Explanation: NO, the sentences are not semantically equivalent.

Sentence A describes a situation where infants who were four months old and had been suffering from a disease called "shikor" are now reportedly not suffering from it anymore. 

Sentence B, on the other hand, talks about infants who are four months old and are currently resting after having been sick, with an implication that they are not currently suffering from the illness.

The key difference is that Sentence A suggests a recovery from the illness, while Sentence B suggests that the infants are still in a state of rest or recovery but does not explicitly state that they are no longer suffering from the illness.

Explanation: NO, the sentences are not semantically equivalent.

Sentence A provides specific information about Dr. Ehud Yure, who is a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. It mentions his involvement in medical and scientific research related to the Canadian Pain Society and his ongoing research work.

Sentence B, on the other hand, is incomplete and does not convey a clear or complete meaning. It seems to attempt to describe a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, but it lacks the necessary details and context to be meaningful or equivalent to Sentence A.

Explanation: NO, the sentences are not semantically equivalent.

Sentence A discusses a person who, like other experts, is uncertain about whether a specific type of diabetes (Type 1) can be cured, noting that those who have been affected have not shown any change. 

Sentence B, on the other hand, mentions a person who, like other experts, is uncertain about whether this specific diabetes condition has been cured or not, but it does not provide additional context or results about those affected. 

The key difference is that Sentence A provides additional information about the lack of change in those affected, which is not present in Sentence B.

Sentence A provides detailed information about Sara Danius, mentioning her role as the permanent secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature at the Swedish Academy. It also discusses her statement on a Swedish radio program regarding the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to Bob Dylan, indicating that he has not yet responded to the award.

Sentence B, on the other hand, is incomplete and lacks the specific details provided in Sentence A. It mentions Sara Danius and her role but does not provide the context or details about the radio program or the Nobel Prize discussion.

Match: YES
Explanation: YES, the two sentences are semantically equivalent. 

Both sentences convey the same message: the speaker, Daniel, is expressing that there is nothing to do at the moment, and he has received a positive response after sending an email to the nearby office. The slight differences in wording do not change the overall meaning of the sentences.

Explanation: NO, the two sentences are not semantically equivalent.

Sentence A describes a situation where Jim Siminov, who is the main accountant of a ring company, was not able to hear the office phone ringing because he was in a tent located in the garage. As a result, he was worried.

Sentence B, on the other hand, states that Jim Siminov was thinking about the office phone because he could not hear it from where he was in the garage. 

While both sentences involve Jim Siminov and the inability to hear the office phone, Sentence A provides additional context about his role and location (in a tent in the garage) and mentions his worry, whereas Sentence B focuses more on his thought process without mentioning the tent or his emotional state.

Match: NO
Explanation: NO, the two sentences are not semantically equivalent.

Sentence A: እሱ ናይ ዋይፋይ ማዕጾ ደወል ሰሪሑ ኢሉ ተዛሪቡ።
This sentence means "He was informed that the Wi-Fi office phone is working."

Sentence B: እቲ ዋዕላ እቲ ዋይ-ፋይ ሩተር እንተሰርሐ ኣረጋገመ።
This sentence means "He confirmed that the Wi-Fi router is working."

The first sentence refers to the functionality of a phone in the Wi-Fi office, while the second sentence refers to the functionality of a Wi-Fi router. Therefore, they do not convey the same meaning.

Match: NO
Explanation: NO, the sentences are not semantically equivalent.

Sentence A states that Siminoff appeared on "Shark Tank" in 2013 and was rejected as a seller. It implies that his pitch or product was not accepted or successful on the show.

Sentence B, on the other hand, indicates that Siminoff participated in "Shark Tank" in 2013 and was highlighted as an entrepreneur who faced challenges. It suggests a focus on his entrepreneurial journey rather than the outcome of his appearance on the show.

The key difference lies in the focus: Sentence A emphasizes the rejection, while Sentence B highlights the entrepreneurial aspect and challenges.

Match: YES
Explanation: YES, the two sentences are semantically equivalent. 

Both sentences convey the same core information: In 2017, Siminoff appeared on the television channel QVC. The differences in wording, such as "ዳሕረዋይ" (later) versus "መወዳእታ" (end), and "ተራእዩ" (appeared) versus "ተመርኮዩ" (featured), do not change the overall meaning of the sentences. Both describe an event involving Siminoff and the QVC channel in the year 2017.

Explanation: NO, the sentences are not semantically equivalent.

Sentence A discusses a ring that was opened by a corporation named "ኤዲቲ" (EDT) that was involved in a certain activity (implied to be related to the ring). 

Sentence B, on the other hand, talks about a corporation that was previously in a state of decline or was not functioning well ("እትደርሕቲ ዝነበረ") and then opened the ring.

The key difference is that Sentence A specifies the corporation's name and its involvement with the ring, while Sentence B focuses on the corporation's previous state and does not mention the corporation's name or its specific involvement with the ring.

Explanation: NO, the sentences are not semantically equivalent.

Sentence A states that there is no vaccine or medicine that has been proven to prevent or cure Ebola, despite ongoing research efforts. It emphasizes the lack of a proven solution up to the present time.

Sentence B, on the other hand, suggests that there is no known vaccine or medicine that has been developed to prevent or cure Ebola, indicating that the research is still in progress. It implies that the research is ongoing but does not specifically mention the current status of any potential solutions.

The key difference is that Sentence A highlights the absence of a proven solution despite research, while Sentence B focuses on the ongoing nature of the research without specifying the current status of solutions.

Match: NO
Explanation: NO, the two sentences are not semantically equivalent.

Sentence A discusses a situation where an antibody initially showed promise in trials but later failed to meet expectations, resulting in a disappointing outcome. It suggests that the antibody was initially thought to be effective but ultimately did not deliver the expected results.

Sentence B, on the other hand, states that the antibody was not effective because the treatment was not properly administered or followed. It implies that the failure was due to the improper application of the treatment rather than the inherent ineffectiveness of the antibody itself.

In summary, Sentence A attributes the failure to the antibody's performance, while Sentence B attributes it to the improper administration of the treatment.

Match: NO
Explanation: NO, the sentences are not semantically equivalent.

Sentence A discusses the use of Zmapp as a therapeutic agent in a PALM trial, indicating that it was used as a complementary treatment alongside three other types of treatments. It emphasizes the role of science in enhancing the treatment process.

Sentence B, on the other hand, mentions the use of Zmapp as an evaluative entity in a PALM trial, suggesting it was used for comparison or assessment purposes. It also refers to five other types of treatments, not three, as in Sentence A.

The key differences lie in the roles attributed to Zmapp (therapeutic vs. evaluative) and the number of other treatments mentioned (three vs. five).

Sentence B, on the other hand, mentions the support of the American gymnastics federation for the Olympic Committee but does not complete the thought regarding the creation of a supportive environment for athletes. The sentence is incomplete and lacks the additional context provided in Sentence A about the foundational support for athletes.

Explanation: NO, the sentences are not semantically equivalent.

Sentence A discusses the shared goal of American gymnastics and the USOC (United States Olympic Committee) to create a supportive and safe environment for athletes, focusing on their dreams and well-being.

Sentence B, however, seems to be incomplete and does not convey a clear or complete idea. It mentions American gymnastics and an embassy but lacks a coherent message or goal similar to Sentence A. Therefore, the two sentences do not convey the same meaning.

Sentence B, however, suggests that in 1960, the person worked as a senator with John F. Kennedy and later did not work in the administration of Lyndon Johnson. 

The key difference is that Sentence A indicates the person did work in Johnson's administration, while Sentence B states the opposite.

Sentence A discusses various diplomatic events and relationships, including the Camp David Accords of 1978, the China-U.S. relations in the 1970s, the Iranian revolution of 1979, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. It mentions these events in the context of diplomatic efforts and challenges faced by Carter.

Sentence B, on the other hand, focuses only on the Camp David Accords of 1978 and the China-U.S. relations in the 1970s. It does not mention the Iranian revolution or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, making it less comprehensive than Sentence A.

Sentence B, on the other hand, mentions that the film featuring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone was generally well-received or praised. It focuses on the overall reception of the film rather than specifically highlighting the performances.

The key difference is that Sentence A specifically praises the main performances, while Sentence B talks about the general reception of the film.

Sentence B, on the other hand, talks about the replacement of traditional fuel vehicles (both gasoline and diesel) with electric cars and electric buses, emphasizing the change in the type of vehicles being used.

While both sentences discuss a shift towards electric vehicles, Sentence A focuses on the action of switching by people, whereas Sentence B highlights the replacement of vehicle types. The emphasis and details differ, making them not semantically equivalent.

Sentence A discusses two scenes from the film "Audition (The Fools Who Dream) City Stars" being replaced with "original scenes" and mentions that 26 projects were developed by Lionsgate Studio.

Sentence B states that two parts from the film "Audition (The Fools Who Dream) City Stars" were selected as "original parts" and mentions that 26 projects were completed without specifying the studio involved.

Sentence B describes a different sequence of events: "They were stolen by sea waves, they hid in Tibet with a trembling heart, they escaped from Nepal, and if they reach India."

The key differences are in the actions and conditions described. Sentence A talks about thieves being captured and moved, while Sentence B describes being stolen by waves, hiding, escaping, and a conditional situation regarding reaching India.

Sentence A uses the phrase "ናይ 802.11n ደረጃ" (the 802.11n level) and mentions "ብኽልቲኡ" (in both) to indicate operation on both frequencies. Sentence B uses "እቲ 802.11n ስታንዳርድ" (the 802.11n standard) and "ብሓደ ምሉእ" (with one full) to convey the same idea of dual-frequency operation. Both sentences communicate the same technical capability of the 802.11n standard.
